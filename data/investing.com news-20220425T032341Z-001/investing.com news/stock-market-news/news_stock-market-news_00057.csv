""At the research and development level, we've already achieved such batteries,"" Yoshio Ito, the chief of Panasonic's automotive business, said at a media roundtable.
""But we need to go through various evaluation processes"" before mass-producing them, he said.
Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) current production models, previously said it was aiming to develop cobalt-free batteries, but did not give a specific time frame.
Panasonic has already significantly reduced cobalt content, to about 10 percent in its nickel-cobalt-aluminium cathode chemistry.
Battery makers have been scrambling to reduce cobalt content in lithium-ion batteries as prices of the rarer mineral have multiplied in recent years, and the spread of electric vehicles (EVs) is widely expected to result in cobalt shortages.
This week, the chief executive of U.S. partner Tesla, Elon Musk, sealed a deal with Chinese authorities to build an auto plant in Shanghai, its first factory outside the United States, that would double the size of the EV maker's global manufacturing.
Asked about joining Tesla in producing automotive batteries in China, Ito said the Japanese company ""has not received any official request"" from the EV maker, but that it ""would consider the possibility if requested"".

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it wants to raise awareness among UK firms to the possibility that Britain may leave the EU next March with no transition deal in place.
""As there is no assurance that a transition period will be agreed upon, entities need to consider the scenario where a hard Brexit would take place on 30 March 2019,"" ESMA said in a statement.
Without a transition, financial firms such as trading platforms and asset managers based in Britain may see their connections to EU customers disrupted.
Some trading firms like Cboe Europe (O:CBOE) and the London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) Turquoise platforms have already applied for EU licenses with regulators in Amsterdam to avoid this potential problem.
""On 30 March 2019, firms must have a fully authorized legal entity located in the EU27 to continue providing services in the EU27,"" ESMA said.
The watchdog has already seen an increase in the number of license requests to national regulators in the EU.

""Some NCAs (national regulators) have already been clear to entities that, unless an application is received in the month of June/July, there is no guarantee that authorization will be achievable before 29 March 2019,"" ESMA added.

The thinking, according to investment strategists, is that all of these groups are less exposed to a trade war, because they are less reliant on exports.
In addition, the fortunes of defensive stocks do not rise and fall with the ups and downs of the economy.Thus far, pharmaceutical stocks have been the standout performer.
The pharmaceutical sector is up 14% since early May, five times the gain of the S&P 500.
The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks is up more than 10% during that time, while hitting new record highs.
Consumer staples, which includes food companies, are up more than six percent.
And utilities have gained about 5%, double the S&P's gain."

Scholz also called for non-performing loans in banks' balance sheets to be squeezed to 5 percent gross on the balance sheets to reduce bad credit. 

He spoke in favor of using the ESM as a backstop for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and hoped for quicker progress on financial transaction tax in several euro area countries than in the past.

MILAN (Reuters) - A buoyant media sector following a new bid for British pay-TV firm Sky (L:SKYB) drove European shares higher on Thursday, helping them to stabilize after heavy losses in the previous session when fears of an escalating trade war hit markets.
The region's media index (SXMP) rose 1 percent, with Sky up 2.2 percent after U.S.-based Comcast (O:CMCSA) submitted a $34 billion bid for the group a few hours after Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox raised its offer.
Sky traded above Comcast's recommended offer price of 14.75 pounds as investors bet Fox would make another higher bid.
""Fox has spent 18 months going through the UK regulatory process to acquire Sky and we don't believe 1400p is likely to be its final offer,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts led by Matthew Walker said in a note.
They lifted their price target on the stock to 16 pounds.
Europe's media index has outperformed the market this month, underpinned by the bidding war for Sky but also helped by expectations of a lift to advertising sales from the World Cup soccer matches for broadcasters such as France's TF1 and Britain's  ITV .
ITV (L:ITV) however fell 1.1 percent on Thursday after England was defeated in the semi-final by Croatia, which will face France in the final. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the World Cup boost for ITV was already priced in and it downgraded the stock to neutral, while lifting its rating on TF1 (PA:TFFP) to buy, which helped send the stock up 3.7 percent. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.3 percent by 0903 GMT. Losses among energy and financials curbed gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors, which have recently been favoured for their defensive qualities in the face of worries that a trade war could hurt global growth.
Elsewhere earnings updates drove share price moves. 
Gerresheimer (DE:GXIG) rallied 8.9 percent after the German drugs packaging maker raised the lower end of its revenue growth guidance and unveiled a 350 million euro acquisition to expand in the field of digital drug delivery devices.
Norwegian bank DNB (OL:DNB) dropped 3.9 percent after its second quarter earnings fell short of expectations. 

Overall investors are expecting a solid earnings season in Europe. According to the Thomson Reuters IBES data, second-quarter earnings for the companies on the euro zone's MSCI EMU index <.dMIEM00000PUS> are expected to grow 8.1 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks and commodity markets regained some poise on Thursday, having suffered wild tailspins in the previous session as the United States ratcheted up trade war threats on China.
A 2 percent rebound on China's big bourses (SS) steadied Asian nerves as oil markets clawed back some of Wednesday's 7 percent slump that had marked their worst day in 2-1/2 years.
Beaten-up industrial metals including copper and nickel and European stocks pulled higher too in early trade (EU), while there was some relief for Turkish markets after the lira had been dumped to a record low by interest rate cut talk from its re-elected President Tayyip Erdogan. (IS)
The dollar meanwhile rose to a six-month high against the Japanese yen after U.S. inflation data that bolstered the case for more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year.
""It mostly seems to be relief after the all-red, risk-off day yesterday,"" said Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen.
""The basis for this is not entirely clear to me though because it doesn't seem like this (U.S. threats of another $200 of China trade tariffs) has actually restarted negotiations with China... In fact I would argue that it has made the risk of an accident or an unwanted outcome bigger.""
Europe's moves were less pronounced than Asia's had been, perhaps reflecting that caution.
The Shanghai Composite and blue-chip CSI300 indexes had both ended the day up 2.2 percent. Shares in Japan (T), Australia and Hong Kong closed 1.1, 1 and 0.6 percent higher respectively.
The pan-European STOXX 600 inched up just 0.2 percent though, with gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors offset by losses in the banking sector and in energy firms after the dramatic drop in oil prices.
Germany's 10-year bond yield and the euro were both broadly steady with traders awaiting minutes from the most recent European Central Bank meeting. A Reuters report showed its policymakers remain split on when to raise interest rates next year.
The difference between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and equivalent German Bund yields stood near 30-year highs at 2.59 percent.
""If stocks drop sharply then the Fed will pause and, moreover, we think the U.S. is toward the end of its rate hike cycle,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
CAUTION, FRAGILE CHINA
Focus was still on what the next steps in the tit-for-tat trade conflict might be. China has accused the United States of bullying and warned it could hit back, although the form of retaliation is not yet clear.
The retaliatory options available to China include boycotting American goods, sharply devaluing the yuan, and selling off U.S. Treasury holdings, Xiao Minjie, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, wrote in a note.
China's yuan had strengthened 0.3 percent overnight though,, partially recovering from a big slide the previous day after an official currency market level set by the People's Bank of China was not as weak as some had feared.
""It shows the central bank intends to stabilize the market and calm investors. One-way speculation on the yuan's depreciation is not in Chinese authorities' interests,"" said Qi Gao, Asia FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 94.700 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight.
Against the yen, which usually strengthens in times of political tension and market turmoil, the greenback stretched its overnight rally and rose to 112.385 yen, its highest since January.
Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar crawled higher having suffered deep losses on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar was also shade higher at C$1.3201 per dollar following a loss of 0.75 percent the previous day.
In commodities there was also stabilization.
Brent crude futures rose 1.5 percent to $74.52 a barrel after tanking 6.9 percent on Wednesday, after the trade tensions and signs Libya's oil exports could pick up again, triggered the biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016.
Metals were recovering from their own 2-4 percent meltdown too. Copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.8 percent to $6,194.00 a ton. The industrial metal sank nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, plumbing a one-year low of $6,081.00.

""We cannot comment in detail on the state of our ongoing discussions with our partner Brilliance at this point in time,"" BMW said in an e-mailed statement on Thursday.
German business magazine Manager Magazin said BMW was to increase its stake in BBA to at least 75 percent from 50 percent. Bloomberg News reported a new ownership structure was to be unveiled soon, citing a person familiar with the plan.
The news comes two weeks after China unveiled a long-anticipated easing of foreign investment curbs on the automotive industry and other sectors, as Beijing moves to fulfil its promise to open its markets further.
Foreign ownership limits for passenger car manufacturing will be removed by 2022.
Manager Magazin said BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger and Brilliance Chairman Yumin Qi had agreed on the stake hike by BMW during a visit by Premier Li Keqiang to Germany this week.
BMW had announced on Monday and Tuesday a raft of agreements with Chinese partners, including a production capacity increase at BBA, but had not mentioned any plans to increase its holding in the venture.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China is preparing to give swift regulatory approvals to India-manufactured drugs, the head of an Indian export promotion group said, as Beijing looks for new commercial partners ahead of what could be a protracted trade war with the United States.
Indian firms are looking to fill gaps in Chinese demand for generic drugs, software, sugar and some varieties of rice, trade officials in New Delhi said.
""We do feel that China is receptive at this time and it's all about making prices competitive,"" said a government official involved in the effort to promote trade with China. The official declined to be identified since he is not authorized to speak to the media.
No concrete deals have been signed but the outlook for pharmaceutical sales from India is positive, according to officials from both nations.
India dominates the world's generic drugs market, exporting $17.3 billion of drugs in the 2017/18 (April-March) year, including to the United States and the EU. But only 1 percent of that went to China, the world's second-largest market for pharmaceuticals, industry data shows.
Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil), which falls under India's trade ministry, told Reuters in an interview that Indian firms could expect to win licenses to export to China within six months of application.
""We understand internally that Chinese authorities have issued instructions that EU-approved Indian suppliers should be granted the industrial drug license in an expeditious manner so they can enter the Chinese market within six months,"" Dua said.
Many Indian drug-makers are already selling to the European Union. The EU is already one of India's key export markets for medicines, and accounted for about 15 percent of overall drug exports in 2016/17, according to Pharmexcil. 
Swift regulatory approvals in China would allow Indian companies to boost revenue at a time when pricing scrutiny and regulatory troubles have hurt U.S. sales.
Some of India's largest drugmakers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (NS:SUN) and  Lupin  Ltd (NS:LUPN) as well as  Aurobindo Pharma  Ltd (NS:ARBN), have been trying for years to expand in the massive Chinese market, which is second only to the United States.
Details of Chinese moves to open up its heavily regulated pharmaceuticals sector have not been previously reported.
The China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this week that China was moving forward on giving greater market access to Indian drug makers.
""China and India are witnessing a growth in pharmaceutical trade, and the two sides are in sound communication on opening the Chinese market to drugs from India and conducting dialogue and co-operation between the two sides' pharmaceutical industries,"" Hua told a regular news conference on Monday.
""The relevant departments have formulated specific measures on promoting China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation and granting greater access to drugs from India. We believe that stronger pharmaceutical trade co-operation will contribute to the well being of the people in our two countries.""
PENDING CLEARANCE
In May, China exempted import tariffs on 28 drugs, including all cancer drugs, a move that would help India reduce its trade imbalance with China, Luo Zhaohui, the Chinese ambassador to India said.
China has been touting greater access to cancer drugs and pushing to lower prices in a bid to soothe a major social issue in the country, where traditionally many patients with serious illness have had to pay out of their pocket for cutting-edge drugs or have had to buy medicines through unapproved grey market channels.
China also lags far behind in terms of drug approvals versus developed markets.
The issue was highlighted in a recent film that went viral in China which echoed the U.S. “Dallas Buyers Club” about a Chinese cancer patient who had helped others getting unapproved cancer drugs at lower prices shipped in from India.
About 250 product applications from Indian drug firms are pending before the CFDA, some of them for years, an Indian trade ministry official said.
Bilateral trade between the two Asian nations touched $89.6 billion in 2017/18 with the trade deficit widening to $62.9 billion in China's favor, an over nine-fold increase over the last decade.
The two sides are discussing ways to increase Indian sales of farm products, including sugar and some varieties of rice, to China.
India is also trying to persuade China to give access to its cost-competitive software service firms that have dominated global markets. Some of these firms are pitching for 'smart' manufacturing projects in the central city of Wuhan and two other provinces in the healthcare and automotive sector.
But it is in the drugs sector that India is hoping to make the first dent, according to officials and a government document.
China has agreed to train Indian pharmaceutical executives to help them gain a swifter entry into the Chinese market, a government document seen by Reuters on efforts to improve trade with China showed. The training is planned for next month.
India's Pharmexcil and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Medicines and Health Products will shortly sign an agreement to ease clearance processes and help Indian companies find Chinese partners, according to the document.

Dua and the Indian trade ministry official said China will soon open a desk at its embassy in New Delhi to facilitate Indian drug makers.

The move by MUFG's banking unit is likely to force its customers to stop all dealings with Iran because most international trade requires clearing through financial institutions.
U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a multi-party deal on Iran's nuclear program and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 agreement.
Washington later told countries to stop buying Iran's crude oil, that nation's most important export item, by Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. 
Japan is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude, and MUFG Bank Ltd handles the bulk of those imports, industry sources have told Reuters.
The bank has informed customers in Japan about the decision, given that dealings with Iranian financial institutions will be prohibited after a 180-day wind-down period, which ends on Nov. 4, the document showed.
MUFG may revise its policy should additional guidance be given by the United States, the bank said in the document.

MUFG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The test, introduced since the financial crisis a decade ago forced British taxpayers to bail out several lenders, has focused on the resilience of a bank's core capital buffer.
But the BoE said on Thursday this year's test would also include secondary buffers held by the banks to reflect their domestic and global systemic importance.
The BoE said the ""uplifts"" assumed from including a systemic risk buffer would add 2.5 percent to the overall hurdle rate of Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), and 1 percent to those of  Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA), Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), Santander (MC:SAN) UK and Nationwide.
The BoE also said it was making changes to how it assesses another secondary buffer knows as Pillar 2A, a measure of financial strength that assesses a bank's capacity to manage risk.
However, the changes being made specifically to the treatment of Pillar 2A capital in the test mean that ""on average, hurdle rates are expected to be lower than they would be under the previous calculation"" for that buffer.
The result of this year's test is due around year-end.

The companies will invest in China across major cities - Tier 1 and core Tier 2 - via developments, acquisition and master-lease of commercial assets to be converted into rental housing, CPPIB said in a statement.
Beijing-based Longfor, China's No. 9 homebuilder by sales value, is one of the most aggressive players in the policy-supported rental housing sector, with a target to add 45,000 new units in the second half to its 20,000 unit portfolio. It expects operating income from renal housing business to be over 3 billion yuan ($448.60 million) in 2020.
The company was the first in the country to issue bonds to the public for the business, as Chinese developers have been rushing to raise funds, including via the securitization and debt market, since the second half of last year for the low-return sector.
China announced plans in August to launch pilot programs in 13 major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, to develop rental housing projects in an effort to ease a housing shortage.
""Demand for modern, quality rental housing amongst young professionals and new graduates in China is growing rapidly, and through this collaboration, we are pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this fast-growing sector of Chinese real estate and to further diversify our investments in the market,"" said Jimmy Phua, CPPIB's Asia head of real estate investments.
CPPIB and Longfor first started collaborating in 2014 with investments in retail malls and mixed-use projects.

Middle East deliveries by the French brands fell 25.8 percent, the group said, reflecting the deconsolidation of Iran sales from May 1.

In Europe, however, a rejuvenated SUV lineup helped lift deliveries by 8.4 percent, excluding the Opel-Vauxhall business.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 11:35PM ET</span>","JD.com's finance affiliate raises $2 billion, more than doubles valuation","By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - JD.com Inc's finance affiliate said on Thursday it has signed binding agreements with investors to raise 13 billion yuan ($1.96 billion) in fresh equity at a valuation of nearly $20 billion.
The fundraising underscores investor enthusiasm for big, privately-held Chinese technology companies even as public valuations falter. This week, smartphone maker Xiaomi completed the world's largest tech IPO in almost four years, but saw its shares fall on debut in Hong Kong even after pricing its deal at the low end of its offered range.
JD Finance will reach a valuation of 133 billion yuan ($19.8 billion) after the closing of the fundraising, it said in a statement.
The valuation is more than double the roughly 60 billion yuan JD Finance was estimated to be worth after it was split from JD.com, China’s second-largest e-commerce firm, in mid-2017.
Investors in this round include CICC Capital, a unit of investment bank China International Capital Corp (CICC), brokerage China Securities, private equity firm Citic Capital and BOCGI, Bank of China's investment arm, JD Finance said.
The fundraising is expected to close in the third quarter, it said. Reuters first reported the fundraising details on Wednesday.
JD Finance's fundraising follows that of Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], the affiliate of its arch rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which last month was valued at $150 billion when it raised $14 billion in the world's largest-ever single fundraising by a private company.
The investments suggest investors remain keen to put money into online payments and lending services in China, especially those backed by large companies such as Alibaba and JD.com which already have stable user traffic. JD.com itself is backed by U.S. retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Chinese gaming behemoth Tencent.
Earlier this year another tech heavyweight, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), raised $1.9 billion from a consortium led by U.S. private equity firms TPG and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) in the spin-off of its finance unit.
JD Finance, whose financial offerings include consumer credit and wealth management products, is expected to seek a domestic initial public offering at some point although there is no firm time table for a listing, according to the sources.
JD Finance said on Wednesday it currently doesn’t have an IPO plan.
The firm plans to use proceeds from the fundraising to invest in domestic financial institutions and buy securities and banking licenses, among other areas, sources with knowledge have previously told Reuters.
In mid-2017, JD.com spun off the unit, making it a fully Chinese-owned entity, a criterion needed to obtain licenses to manage certain financial products in China.
Under that deal, it sold 28.6 percent for 14.3 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) to undisclosed investors. JD.com receives 40 percent of the restructured entity’s pre-tax profit and has an option to convert that back to a 40 percent equity stake should the regulatory environment change.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:32PM ET</span>",Chipmaker Broadcom inks $19 billion deal to buy software company CA,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc announced a $18.9 billion deal to buy U.S. business software company CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) on Wednesday, venturing far beyond its realm of semiconductors and testing investors' confidence in its Chief Executive Hock Tan's dealmaking credentials.
The CA deal, outlined in a joint statement from the companies, comes just four months after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion hostile bid for semiconductor peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, arguing it posed a threat to U.S. national security and gave an edge to Chinese companies looking to build next-generation wireless networks.
Since then, Broadcom has redomiciled from Singapore to the United States, placing it formally outside the purview of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the government panel that reviews deals for potential national security risks.
Dealmaking has been key to Broadcom's expansion, as it grew from a 4 percent share of the chip market in 2013 to a 30 percent share this year, thanks to acquisitions spearheaded by Tan with backing from private equity firm Silver Lake.
Tan's selection of CA as Broadcom's next acquisition target, however, took Wall Street by surprise, and drove Broadcom shares down 7 percent in after-hours trading. Investors and analysts scrambled to identify potential synergies, as the deal looked more like a financial investment rather than a combination of complementary businesses. 
""Investors will wrestle and try to gain comfort in (the) strategic rationale and its impact to capital allocation,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients, adding that ""lots of explanation (is) needed."" 
Broadcom's chips power smartphones, computers and networking equipment. CA, on the other hand, specializes in software for so-called mainframes, big servers that companies are gradually replacing with cloud computing, and has been seeking to expand in business software.
The disparate corners of the technology market the two companies occupy mean that Broadcom will benefit primarily from CA's recurring revenue, rather than operational synergies.
Broadcom Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause defended the deal's rationale in an interview, pointing to experience the company already has beyond chips, in selling networking gear to big businesses operating data centers. 
Last year, Broadcom acquired networking gear company Brocade Communications Systems for $5.5 billion. Brocade's networking gear often connects to mainframes provided by International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp, and those are the same mainframes that much of CA's software caters to, Krause said.
""What we do is buy mission-critical technology businesses,"" Krause said. ""CA is a mission-critical technology. ... We've been pretty impressed not only with (CA's) management, but also the team that CA has built around these core franchises that we value.""
Analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said it was unclear how Tan would apply his typical integration model to CA, which has been working to shift to the subscription billing financial model that has become common in that industry.
""We believe this planned acquisition definitely will create some uneasiness amongst its current investor base,"" Chan said of Broadcom.
NEW DEBT
Broadcom will pay $44.50 per share in cash for CA, a 20 percent premium to Wednesday's closing price. It will finance the deal with cash on hand and $18 billion in new debt financing. Previously, as of May 6, Broadcom's debt stood at $17.5 billion.
CA's largest shareholders, Careal Property Group AG and affiliates, which own 25 percent of the outstanding shares of CA, have agreed to vote for the deal, according to the announcement. 
Broadcom's main semiconductor business is becoming more competitive as major customers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd look to consolidate supplier relationships and slash costs. This led to Broadcom pursuing Qualcomm, despite the latter spurning its advances.
In March, Trump signed an order to halt what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal between Broadcom and Qualcomm on concerns it would erode the United States' lead in mobile technology and pave the way for China to gain the upper hand.
Krause said Broadcom has ""a very clear roadmap"" to closing the CA deal by the fourth quarter. ""We're an American company,"" he said, when asked about CFIUS having a role in the deal.
CA CEO Mike Gregoire has been looking for a deal for some time. Talks last year to merge with private equity-owned peer BMC Software fell through.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) advised Broadcom, and Qatalyst Partners advised CA.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:31PM ET</span>",Walmart looks to exit Japan with Seiyu supermarket sale: NIkkei,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) has decided to sell Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu and has already approached major retailers and private equity funds, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.
If realized, the sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.7 billion to $4.5 billion), the Nikkei said, without citing its sources.
Walmart said it does not comment on market speculation.
A sale would be the latest exit by Walmart from a lower-growth market as it looks to shake up its overseas business and invest in places like China and India.
The world's biggest retailer said last month it had sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International, exiting an underperforming business in its third major international deal since April.
In addition to competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Japan's supermarkets are being squeezed by chains such as convenience stores and discount drugstores in a sluggish consumption environment.
In January Walmart said it was launching an online grocery service with  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755), in what Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said he hoped may be a precursor to greater global cooperation.
Walmart has struggled to replicate the success of its low-price model with Seiyu despite the introduction of an ""everyday low price"" pledge and frequent discounting.
Japanese supermarkets, with lots of workers preparing fresh food and high levels of customer service, are famous for their low margins and are proving a drag for many retailers.
Recent industry consolidation saw the creation of FamilyMart Uny Holdings Co Ltd (T:8028) in 2016, a deal that focused on expanding the number of FamilyMart convenience stores. Such stores have increasingly become a priority for retailers as a growth driver.
Discounter Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd (T:7532) has taken a 40 percent stake in Uny as it looks for room to expand. Earlier this year Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382) announced a tie-up with regional general merchandise store chain  Izumi Co Ltd  (T:8273).
Japan's supermarket industry has proved difficult for foreign retail giants, with exits by  Tesco  (L:TSCO) in 2011 and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) in 2005.

32,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",ZTE Soars After U.S. Signs Deal to Lift Tech-Purchase Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- ZTE Corp (HK:0763).’s shares surged after it inked an agreement with the Trump administration to allow the company to resume doing business with American suppliers, meeting a key Chinese government demand amid escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
The Chinese telecoms gear-maker signed an escrow agreement with the Commerce Department and a ban on U.S. technology purchases will lift as soon as ZTE deposits $400 million, the department said in an emailed statement Wednesday. A person familiar with the matter said the escrow payment should be completed within a day.
ZTE last month took a major step forward in meeting the White House’s conditions by sacking its entire board and appointing a new chairman. Its new management faces the challenge of rebuilding trust with phone companies and corporate customers. But the company is said to be facing at least $3 billion in total losses from a months-long moratorium that choked off the chips and other components needed to make its networking gear and smartphones.
Shares in ZTE, which is currently operating on a temporary waiver that expires Aug. 1, soared as much as 24 percent in Hong Kong. Its Shenzhen-listed stock rose by its 10-percent daily limit. Several of its suppliers, including Zhong Fu Tong Group Co., also rose sharply on mainland Chinese bourses.
“As ZTE is finally near the end of the tunnel, we believe its current stock price incorporates an overly pessimistic view on the settlement,” Edison Lee and Timothy Chau, analysts for Jefferies, wrote in a note Thursday. “Assuming ZTE will be able to get back into business next week, we believe the market will start focusing on its earnings prospects.”
ZTE representatives had met with Commerce Department officials on Monday to discuss a path forward for the deal, people familiar with the meeting said on condition of anonymity.
“Once the monitor is selected and brought on board, the three-pronged compliance regime -- the new 10-year suspended denial order, the $400 million escrow, and the monitor -- will be in place,” Commerce said in the statement. “The ZTE settlement represents the toughest penalty and strictest compliance regime the Department has ever imposed in such a case. It will deter future bad actors and ensure the Department is able to protect the United States from those that would do us harm.”
Path Forward
The Trump administration in April announced a seven-year ban on U.S. exports to ZTE after it said the company violated sanctions agreements by selling American technology to Iran and North Korea. The ban forced ZTE to announce it was shutting down.
Then President Donald Trump reversed course in May, saying he was reconsidering penalties on ZTE as personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Later that month, his administration announced it would allow the company to stay in business after paying a $1.3 billion fine, changing its management and providing “high-level security guarantees.”
A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers remains concerned about ZTE’s threat to U.S. national security and is pushing for legislation aimed at restoring harsher penalties. Wednesday marks the start of negotiations on legislation that will try to balance concerns that ZTE presents a security risk with efforts to get the company back into business.

Markets continue to deal with the possibility of escalation in the dispute between the two nations after the Trump administration threaten to impose tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods on Wednesday. The 10% tariffs will not take effect immediately but will undergo a two-month review process.
In response, China's commerce ministry said in a statement released around midday on Wednesday that it was ""shocked"" by the latest U.S. trade action and urged international community to work together against the trade bullying, while calling the actions ""completely unacceptable"".
The news came just days after tariffs from the U.S. and China on $34 billion in products from each country took effect last week.
Overnight, U.S. stocks fell on the back of the latest developments in the ongoing trade dispute: The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9%, the S&P 500 slid 0.7% and the NASDAQ Composite edged down by 0.56%.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 1.3% and 1.6% higher by 9:40PM ET (01:40 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.3%.
Reports on Wednesday suggested that Beijing is ready to “hit back in other ways,” and is considering options including delaying approvals of mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies, holding up licenses for U.S. firms and “delaying and ramping up” inspections of American products at borders.
Chinese telecom company ZTE Corp (HK:0763) received some attention as the Trump administration said the company has signed an escrow agreement with the Commerce Department and its ban will be lifted as soon as the company deposits $400 million in escrow.
“Once the monitor is selected and brought on board, the three-pronged compliance regime -- the new 10-year suspended denial order, the $400 million escrow, and the monitor -- will be in place,” Commerce said on Wednesday in a statement. “The ZTE settlement represents the toughest penalty and strictest compliance regime the Department has ever imposed in such a case. It will deter future bad actors and ensure the Department is able to protect the United States from those that would do us harm.”
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.2%, while South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.3%. The Bank of Korea's meeting concludes Thursday, with economists expecting officials to hold their key rate at 1.5%.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8%."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) is counting on the votes of public-sector Brazilian shareholders to outweigh any potential investor objections to its tie-up with Boeing SA (N:BA), two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Doubts about the valuation of Embraer's commercial jet unit in a proposed $4.75 billion joint venture sent Embraer shares tumbling nearly 15 percent in a single day last week, although shares are still up 32 percent since the deal was first reported.
Some small investors have complained the deal effectively gives Boeing control of Embraer's main business without having to pay the 50 percent premium called for in a poison pill in the planemaker's bylaws. Top foreign shareholders have so far kept mum on the issue.
Even if those offshore investors do object, however, one of Embraer's little-known corporate bylaws will effectively give a Brazilian-held share about six times the weight of a foreigner's at a shareholder assembly, according to the sources who requested anonymity to discuss the deal publicly.
The support of public-sector pension fund Previ and state development bank BNDES, which together hold about 10 percent of Embraer shares may thus prove decisive, the sources added, underlining the sway of the Brazilian government which also has a ""golden share"" in the formerly state-controlled company.
Embraer, Boeing and Previ declined to comment on the matter.
BNDES did not reply to questions.
LITTLE-KNOWN BYLAW
Embraer's corporate statutes grant Brazilians at least 60 percent of voting rights at shareholder meetings, even though domestic shareholders held just 19 percent of Embraer's outstanding shares as of March, according to the company — and about half of those belong to Previ and BNDES.
BNDES, which holds the shares through investment arm BNDES Participações SA, was part of a government working group discussing the tie-up along with representatives of the finance and defense ministries. BNDES head Dyogo Oliveira on Tuesday said it was ""certainly a good deal.""
Previ, which manages pensions for employees of state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), has not made its stance on the deal public.
Embraer's top shareholders, Brandes Investment Partners LP, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Mondrian Investment Partners LP may also have their say limited by a bylaw restricting the voting rights of investors with more than 5 percent of shares — the case for all three as recently as March.
All three fund managers declined to comment.
SHAREHOLDER RESISTANCE
While Embraer shares are still up 32 percent since Boeing disclosed its interest, some analysts have suggested investors were shortchanged by the U.S. jetmaker's final offer.
The lack of a full takeover offer for Embraer, including its defense and business jet operations, was a result of the Brazilian government's concern about the sovereignty of military programs, backed up by its golden share.
""We see strong odds of Embraer shareholders demanding a higher price for the stake in the commercial segment, given this unit's strategic value and low financial impact on Boeing,"" BTG Pactual analyst Renato Mimica wrote in a Thursday note.
A local fund manager holding less than 1 percent of Embraer shares, who asked not to be named to preserve relations with management, said the valuation was low and asked why investors other than BNDES had not been previously consulted on the deal.
Facing an uphill battle at the shareholder assembly, Renato Chaves, a former director at pension fund Previ, filed a formal complaint to Brazilian securities regulator CVM last week.
Chaves argued the deal was designed to avoid Embraer's poison pill ensuring an offer to all shareholders with a 50 percent premium over market prices if any investor buys 35 percent or more of the company.
""What I see is Embraer selling 85 percent of its revenue to Boeing, and the poison pill should apply,"" said Chaves. ""What they are doing is a disguised acquisition designed to avoid the poison pill.""
CVM does not comment on investor complaints beyond its public decisions.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. government contractor Engility explores sale: sources,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor  Engility Holdings Inc  (N:EGL) is exploring a sale, amid a wave of consolidation in the U.S. government services sector, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The development is the latest example of how increased defense spending under U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican Party is driving contractors to pursue mergers so that they have more scale to bid on bigger projects, spanning everything from outdated computer systems to antiquated cyber security.
Engility has attracted interest from companies that include  CACI International Inc  (N:CACI) and Science Applications International Corp (SAIC) (N:SAIC), though deliberations are at an early stage and may not lead to a deal, two of the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Representatives from Engility and CACI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A SAIC representative declined to comment.
Chantilly, Virginia-based Engility provides skilled personnel to U.S. departments of defense, homeland security and justice, among others. It has a market capitalization of $1.2 billion.
Engility is no stranger to dealmaking. It acquired privately held peer TASC for about $1.1 billion, including debt, in 2014. At the time, TASC was controlled by private equity firms KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and General Atlantic LLC, who took Engility shares as well as seats on Engility's board as a part of the deal. KKR and General Atlantic now own close to half of Engility.
In April, weapons maker General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) bought CSRA Inc for $9.7 billion to expand its government services business, after CACI withdrew its offer for CSRA following a bidding war.
Beyond General Dynamic's purchase of CSRA, many companies in the government services sector have struck deals this year, including DXC Technology Co (N:DXC), which combined its U.S. public-sector business with Vencore Holding Corp and KeyPoint Government Solutions to create an independent, publicly traded company serving U.S. government clients.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>","Glencore faces lawsuits over U.S. subpoena, stock drop","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc faces at least two lawsuits by U.S. shareholders accusing the big Anglo-Swiss mining company of having made false and misleading disclosures before it received a subpoena in a corruption probe, and its stock tumbled.
The lawsuits were filed on Monday with the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, and on Wednesday after market hours with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
They accused Glencore of concealing how its conduct would subject it to heightened regulatory scrutiny into its compliance with money laundering and bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Glencore did not immediately respond after market hours on Wednesday to requests for comment.
Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg is a defendant in both lawsuits, and Chief Financial officer Steven Kalmin is a defendant in the New Jersey lawsuit.
Glencore's U.S.-listed shares fell 9 percent on July 3 after the company disclosed having a day earlier received a Department of Justice subpoena concerning its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Venezuela.
On Wednesday, Glencore said it would cooperate with the Justice Department and had set up a board committee, including chairman and former  BP  (LON:BP) Plc Chief Executive Tony Hayward, to oversee its response.
Some analysts have said the subpoena might have resulted from Glencore's settling of a mining dispute in Congo with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, under U.S. sanctions since last year, by agreeing to pay royalties in euros.
Analysts have said Congo accounts for about 25 percent of Glencore's net present value.
Glencore mines cobalt, a key ingredient in batteries for electric vehicles, in the central African country.
Both lawsuits seek unspecified damages for shareholders, who hope to pursue their claims as groups in class actions.
It is common for shareholders to file U.S. lawsuits accusing companies of misleading them about their businesses and saying that their stock prices declined once the truth came out.

The cases are Church v Glencore Plc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 18-11477; and Robison v Glencore Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-06286.

(Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday that it signed an agreement with ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) that paves the way for the Chinese tech company to resume operations after a nearly three-month ban on doing business with American suppliers.
The ban on China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker will be removed once the company deposits $400 million in an escrow account, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a statement announcing that an escrow agreement had been signed. 
The ban, which was imposed in April and caused ZTE to cease major operations, has been a source of friction between Washington and Beijing, which are engaged in an escalating trade dispute.
ZTE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Today's announcement marks the beginning of the end of this long-running saga,"" said Washington attorney Douglas Jacobson, who represents ZTE suppliers.
The escrow agreement is part of a $1.4 billion settlement ZTE reached with the Commerce Department last month to regain access to U.S. suppliers, whose components it relies on for its smartphones and networking gear.
The ban was imposed after ZTE broke an agreement reached after ZTE pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court last year for illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.
The new settlement includes a $1 billion penalty that ZTE paid to the U.S. Treasury last month and the $400 million in the escrow account that the United States could seize if ZTE violates the latest settlement. The $1 billion penalty is in addition to nearly $900 million ZTE paid last year.
Once the ban is lifted, ZTE, which employs around 80,000 people, is expected to restart major operations. The reprieve for ZTE coincides with a new Trump administration threat of 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
In its statement, the Commerce Department said the ZTE action is a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader discussions of trade policy. 
""The ZTE settlement represents the toughest penalty and strictest compliance regime the department has ever imposed in such a case,"" the Commerce Department said.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted in May that he had closed down ZTE and then let it reopen, although no agreement to lift the ban had yet been reached. He said he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast."" ZTE had said the ban threatened its survival. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said last month that Trump decided to allow ZTE to again buy U.S. parts and components as a personal favor to Xi to show good will for bigger efforts. U.S. suppliers have been anxious to resume business since U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the settlement on June 7. ZTE paid over 200 U.S. companies more than $2.3 billion in 2017, including  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN). Shares of smaller U.S. suppliers, which are more dependent on ZTE, pared losses after the news, including optical component makers Acacia Communications Inc (O:ACIA),  Oclaro  Inc  (O:OCLR) and Lumentum Holdings Inc (O:LITE). ZTE's shares were suspended for almost two months after the ban was imposed and have lost about half their value. 
The company last week received a limited one-month reprieve from the Commerce Department to maintain existing networks and equipment.
Under the new settlement, ZTE was required to change its board and management within 30 days. It also will operate for the next 10 years under a suspended ban. The current ban could have lasted up to seven years. 
In addition, the company must hire an outside compliance monitor selected by the Commerce Department. The department missed a 30-day deadline to choose the monitor, but said on Wednesday the timetable was adjusted to conduct ""due diligence.""
A controversial monitor appointed to a three-year term by a federal judge in Texas as part of last year's guilty plea already is in place.
ZTE also agreed to allow the U.S. government unfettered site visits to verify U.S. components are being used as claimed by ZTE, and to post calculations of the U.S. components in its products on its website in Chinese and English.
Members of the U.S. Senate last month urged Trump to reconsider the settlement, saying that ZTE posed ""a significant threat"" to national security. 
The Senate paved the way for a showdown with Trump over the issue last month, when it passed an annual defense policy bill including an amendment attempting to reverse the deal. The measure could still be killed when Senate and House of Representatives meet in the coming weeks to forge a compromise version of the bill.
Chuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, on Wednesday called the ZTE deal ""awful"" and said it would ""undermine our national and economic security."" He said he hopes his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate will ""maintain the Senate's strong language in the defense bill."" 
Reuters revealed on June 5 that ZTE had signed a preliminary agreement with the Commerce Department, along with the fine and other terms. It also broke news of the ban in April. 

A U.S. investigation into ZTE was launched after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship hardware and software worth millions of dollars to Iran from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies. (https://reut.rs/2GbpCmO)

43,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. June CPI Seen Staying Tame
Tomorrow the highlight of the economic data will be consumer inflation. The measure of wholesale inflation released Wednesday came in a little hotter than expected.
Economists forecast that in June the consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% month over month.
June year-over-year CPI is expected come in at 2.9%, a tad higher than the previous month.
There will also be the weekly data for initial jobless claims, expected to dip slightly form the week before.
2. Fed’s Kashkari and Harker Set to Speak
While the economic data arrive ahead of trading, investors focused on the path of interest rates will also be parsing comments by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari.
He is scheduled to speak at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) at a panel on immigration, but may have remarks germane to Fed policy. Kashkari, considered a dove on rates, told Bloomberg recently he is comfortable with rates moving to neutral, but doesn’t think a restrictive rate policy is warranted.
On Wednesday, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans gave some hawkish comments, telling The Wall Street Journal that the strength of the economy means businesses and consumers can live with slightly higher rates.
Philadelphia Fed President Pat Harker will also give a speech Thursday at 12:15 PM ET (16:15 GMT). Harker is also in the camp for rates to rise just to a neutral level.
3. Investors Will Be Watching Delta’s Guidance Closely
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is the one major company reporting earnings Thursday.
On average, analysts expect the carrier to report before the bell a profit of $1.74 per share for the latest quarter on revenue of $11.65 billion.
The company itself already lowered second-quarter profit guidance last June to a range of $1.65 to $1.75 a share, so investors may be more focused on its guidance for the third quarter.
Last week,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) downgraded Delta to hold, citing a lack of positive catalysts. Deutsche also cut ratings on United Continental (NYSE:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) chief executive for Latin America took part in a medical equipment price-fixing scheme while at the conglomerate, making it a member of an international health-care cartel, according to allegations in a document filed by federal prosecutors.
The executive, Daurio Speranzini Jr., was one of 20 people jailed last week in what prosecutors say was an arrangement among multinational companies Philips (AS:PHG), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), and several others. They say the scheme involved bribing government health officials, in return for help in inflating prices for an array of medical gear such as magnetic resonance imaging machines and prosthetics.
While those arrests and the general allegations were widely reported last week, a close examination by Reuters of a 362-page court document filed with a Rio de Janeiro judge to gain approval to carry out arrest and search warrants shows that prosecutors also argue that GE was part of the group of companies that allegedly funneled bribes through a politically connected local medical supply firm. 
That firm, Oscar Iskin, then passed varying percentages of the bribes to government officials to fix prices for medical equipment and other products, prosecutors assert. 
“The situation takes on an even greater gravity given that even after the internal investigation (at Philips) that resulted in Speranzini’s departure from the company, he joined another company in the health sector (GE) in which he continued carrying out illicit practices relative to government contracts,” the document states. 
The documents cited “robust evidence” that Speranzini “participated in the crimes of corruption, fraudulent bidding, and forming a criminal organization,"" adding, “there is also evidence that he attempted to cover-up the crimes so that regulating bodies would not find out."" 
In response to questions from Reuters, GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said Monday that GE is “currently not aware of any improper conduct involving GE Healthcare and are committed to cooperating with authorities to the extent we are contacted.”
At the time of Speranzini’s arrest on July 4, GE in a statement said that the allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a different company, though did not specify which one, and added that GE is not the target of the investigation. 
Alexandre Lopes, a lawyer for Miguel Iskin, the CEO of the supply firm, denied the allegations of price-fixing and passing of bribes, and said the company had improved the quality of care available to the general population.
Reuters was unable to locate a lawyer for Speranzini. There are no lawyers listed in the government documents, and GE declined to comment on anything related to the executive still listed on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) as an employee.
Prosecutors declined to comment beyond what was in the document, or elaborate on whether they had contacted GE and whether they were delving into its conduct as a target. They said in their filing in Rio de Janeiro that their investigation is ongoing and that they think it will involve more companies, more arrests and the uncovering of more fraud. 
It was unclear from the document whether prosecutors believe GE had been participating in the cartel before Speranzini's arrival at the company, but the document asserts that he was central to GE’s involvement once he was there. 
Federal prosecutors said in the document that Speranzini took part in the cartel first as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin America from 2004 until the end of 2010, when an internal whistleblower told Philips' compliance office about the fraud and he was fired after an internal probe. His firing and the internal probe at Philips have not been previously reported.
Philips spokesman Steve Klink told Reuters that they have been informed by the Brazilian authorities that the latest arrests are part of an investigation into the medical device industry in Brazil. 
“Philips in Brazil, as well as other companies in the country, are subjects of the investigation. We believe that any allegation against Philips relates to a period that was many years ago,” he said.
Two months after being dismissed by Philips, Speranzini was hired by GE Healthcare and climbed the company ladder, becoming a vice president in Milwaukee before being named as GE's chief executive officer for Latin America in January. GE did not comment on Speranzini’s hiring. 
Cesar Romero - the former No. 2 official at the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat - states in his plea bargain testimony that Speranzini won contracts from Brazil’s National Traumatology Institute while at Philips and GE to provide medical equipment at inflated prices at least until the end of 2014, prosecutors said. 
The National Traumatology Institute said they could not comment, referring questions to the federal Health Ministry. The Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
According to prosecutors, Romero also testified that GE was part of what he called an “international bidding club,” which included other multinational health companies such as Philips.
Lawyers for Romero did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Informants in criminal investigations in Brazil are barred by law from talking to the press.
The investigation, code-named ""Operation Resonance,"" is the latest outgrowth of Brazil's unprecedented four years of graft inquiries that have sent scores of powerful politicians and businessmen to prison and rocked the nation's elite, who enjoyed impunity in how they carried out their business.
The inquiry is tied to a long-running corruption scheme attributed to jailed former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral that snatched $100 million from public coffers, prosecutors said.

Speaking to a reception for 200 finance executives, Philippe said most of the changes would be made by the end of the year, as countries across the EU battle to attract bankers from London amid uncertainty over the impact of Brexit on the region's biggest financial center.
For asset managers coming to France, they will be able to have capital income known as carried interest taxed at 30 percent rather than higher income tax rates.
The country will also make it possible to amortize goodwill, as in Germany, as part of a longer term European project to harmonize regulations for calculating corporate tax. 
""A financial center is built with patience, by being consistent. I want this consistency to be the trademark of our economic strategy and our attractiveness policy,"" Philippe said in a speech. 
The moves add to steps already taken by President Emmanuel Macron aimed at boosting Paris as a financial center, such as plans to gradually cut corporate tax to 25 percent and scrapping a wealth tax on financial assets.
Macron's government has also set a flat tax of 30 percent on all capital income and removed the top marginal band of payroll tax, although the moves have led to criticism of Macron as being a president for the rich.
Paris is competing with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg to win over finance jobs in the wake of Britain's departure from the EU next March.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Ian Read on Tuesday to say the company's July 1 price hikes had complicated the administration's drug pricing plans, prompting the company to defer its planned increases, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Pfizer said on Tuesday it was deferring its drug price increases on around 40 drugs for no more than six months after Read's conversation with Trump.
U.S. Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar called Read previously, and the Pfizer CEO asked to speak directly with the president, the source said. 
The conversation took place around 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. Trump, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, had arrived at the U.S. ambassador's residence at about 3:30 p.m. ET. 
Trump tweeted about the call at 6:37 p.m. and Pfizer confirmed it soon after.
The call and subsequent price rollback came a day after Trump took aim at Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers for raising prices on some of their medicines, saying in a tweet that they ""should be ashamed"" and that his administration would respond.
Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he was concerned that Trump had struck a ""secret, sweetheart"" deal with Pfizer and asked for Azar and Pfizer to release details about what was agreed on the calls.
""Instead of proposing meaningful changes that result in lower costs for families and taxpayers, Trump and his Administration are busy scoring cheap PR points that don’t address the fundamental challenges that lead to higher prices every year,"" Wyden said in a press release.
Trump rolled out a blueprint in May on how his administration planned to lower drug prices. Later that month, Trump said that some drug companies would announce ""voluntary, massive"" price decreases in two weeks, though none have materialized yet.
Pfizer on Tuesday said it would defer price increases that went into effect on July 1 until the end of the year or until the president's drug pricing blueprint goes into effect - whichever is sooner. The company said it would return drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible.
Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, now likely will not raise drug prices until after the 2018 midterm elections in November. 

That gives Trump, who made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue, a short-term victory he can point to in the run-up to the elections, which are being closely watched to see if Trump's fellow Republicans will be able to maintain control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors yanked $188 million from the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, run by billionaire money manager Bill Gross, in June, marking four straight months of withdrawals, Morningstar Inc said on Wednesday.
The Janus bond fund's performance has stumbled this year, with some share classes down nearly 7 percent and falling to the bottom of their peer ranking, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper research unit.
The $1.5 billion fund stands a third smaller than it was at its $2.2 billion peak earlier this year, with withdrawals for the year totaling $615 million, Morningstar said.
Janus Henderson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Gross conceded to a ""bad trade"" betting that German government bond prices would fall while positioning for U.S. Treasuries to rise, but said he expected to recover those losses. 
The unconstrained fund gives Gross wide latitude to invest globally, and he has often positioned for rates to rise. Yields on the safest intermediate bonds have largely fallen since May.
Gross, once considered Wall Street's ""Bond King,"" co-founded Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co in 1971 but left abruptly in 2014 after a management rift and moved over to Janus. 
Gross is worth $2.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 02:54PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus faces A330 delivery delays amid HNA Group woes - sources,"By Tim Hepher and Regis Duvignau
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus faces a logjam of undelivered A330 jets worth well over $1 billion for airlines affiliated to China's debt-laden HNA Group following a stand-off over late payments, according to industry sources and a Reuters examination of parked aircraft.
Companies belonging to the troubled Chinese aviation-to-finance conglomerate have delayed payments for several months, leading Airbus to withdraw deliveries rather than step in to finance the aircraft itself, the sources told Reuters.
""After six months of talks, Airbus took the decision to withdraw the planes as it does not want to play the financier,"" said a person familiar with the discussions on Wednesday.
However, another person involved in the matter cautioned: ""It is in the process of being resolved"".
An Airbus spokesman said: ""We keep our talks and contractual terms with customers confidential.""
HNA had no immediate comment.
The cluster of undelivered A330 aircraft came to light on the sidelines of a ceremony to present Airbus's smallest new jet.
Reuters journalists counted five A330s dotted around the delivery center and another parked further away - some with reflective sunshade protectors taped to the cockpit windows and all painted in the flame-red liveries of HNA Group airlines.
These include Hainan Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines and Tianjin Airlines.
Six A330s would cost a total of $1.6 billion at list prices.
TURBULENCE
Various semi-finished A320s could be seen parked, though it was impossible to tell whether these were grounded for the same reasons or because of a wider problem of engine shortages for such planes. Airbus has had a stockpile of up to 100 undelivered single-aisle jets, but said last week this had fallen to 86.
The wide-body A330 aircraft has no such engine supply problems and it is the backlog of those more expensive planes that is causing most concern, the sources said.
An aircraft finance source estimated the total financial burden of holding such an asset, in terms of lost value and the cost of storage and maintenance, at $10,000 per plane per day.
Airbus is already having to handle cash shortfalls from the late delivery of dozens of A320 aircraft.
Unraveling the situation could be made more difficult by the death last week of HNA Group chairman Wang Jian, a financial source said, though HNA quickly named co-founder Chen Feng as sole chairman of the highly centralized group.
Wang, regarded as the architect of HNA’s $50 billion acquisition spree that pushed it into debt, died in southern France on July 3 in what local police said appeared to be an accidental fall from a wall while posing for a photograph.
His death complicates the troubled conglomerate’s efforts to restructure and pay off borrowings, and could increase pressure on HNA to reveal more about its oft-criticized opaque ownership.
""Anything like this creates turbulence, so things are difficult with HNA,"" the financial source said. Another industry source stressed Chen was nonetheless a heavyweight figure.
Financial sources said earlier this year that some airlines linked to HNA were delaying aircraft lease payments to lessors.

Some of the sources said HNA’s flagship Hainan Airlines and smaller ones including Lucky Air and Beijing Capital Airlines had missed payments, while Tianjin Airlines was seeking to extend the term for payments due this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fact that investors are siphoning money out of stocks is not helping gold, with the safe-haven asset suffering as people wary of a global trade war flock to the U.S. dollar.
U.S. fund investors pulled $1 billion from commodity funds, including those invested in the precious metal, the largest withdrawals since July 2017, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday. 
Worries over trade are mounting, helping to push investors away from stocks but also toward the U.S. dollar, which has rallied 5 percent in the past three months against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners. That hurts demand for bullion, which is priced in dollars. 
Data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit last week showed precious metals commodities funds posted nine consecutive weeks of withdrawals, with $2 billion pouring out in June alone, the most since December 2016.
Indeed, trade is unlikely to fade in importance to investors. Washington on Tuesday issued a list of thousands of Chinese imports that the Trump administration wants to target with new tariffs. In response, China accused the United States of bullying and warned it would hit back.
William Rhind, chief executive officer at fund manager GraniteShares Inc, said a trade war could eventually generate inflation that will benefit gold.
""At the moment, the positive inflationary pressures caused by trade tariffs are being beaten back by dollar strength,"" said Rhind.
""As the tariffs take hold and the market adjusts to the effects, we expect inflationary pressures to increase, which will benefit holders of gold and commodities.""
Some $10.6 billion rolled out of U.S.-based stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the most recent week, ICI said, bringing three-week withdrawals to $33.7 billion. The data covers the six days through July 3; the United States observed the Independence Day holiday on July 4.
A subset of equity funds specifically focused on international shares managed to pull in $762 million, their first week of positive sales in the past four, the trade group said.
Bond funds attracted $4.6 billion in the latest week, according to the data. U.S.-based debt funds have not seen withdrawals since February.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Wednesday there is too little choice of auditor for big banks who must switch book-keepers under European Union rules.
Listed firms are required to ""rotate"" auditors at least every two decades to ensure there is a fresh and skeptical pair of eyes examining their books and challenging management.
The audit sector is dominated by the Big Four: PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte. Their nearest rivals, such as Grant Thornton and BDO, are much smaller, meaning that auditing a large bank with many subsidiaries across the global is more of a challenge.
BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said he has ""an issue with the ever more concentrated pool of large auditors"" able to audit large firms that must meet the rotation requirements in Britain.
""We have one particular issue with the subsidiaries of foreign firms who don't have the rotation requirement at home but do have it here. It's in the context of that we have been discussing with firms,"" Woods told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
Sarah Breeden, BoE executive director for international banks supervision, told the lawmakers that the BoE wanted to make sure that the next tier down of auditors from the Big Four had the necessary skills and expertise to audit a business like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International in London.
The Times of London newspaper reported on July 10 that the BoE was examining whether Goldman Sachs could appoint Grant Thornton as an auditor in Britain.
""There is a dialogue that's happening rather than a querying,"" Breeden told lawmakers in response to the report.
The audit sector's regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, said last month that some audits of banks were not up to scratch.
""It's a bit of a worry,"" Woods said of the FRC findings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) is planning to raise $3.5 billion for investments in energy infrastructure in what is poised to be its largest alternative investment fund yet, an executive at the world's largest asset manager told Reuters.
The company announced on Wednesday that it has already raised $1.5 billion for the Global Energy and Power Infrastructure Fund III. The private fund will focus on operating infrastructure, such as power plants, pipelines and wind farms, in developed markets, potentially including the United States.
Mark Florian, BlackRock's global head of its energy and power infrastructure team, said there is growing demand for new infrastructure as countries around the world shift from coal and nuclear power sources to natural gas and renewable energy.
He said large utilities and global energy companies are outsourcing the management and development of infrastructure, creating an opportunity for investment organizations such as his that want to provide capital.
""The needs are just getting bigger,"" Florian said in a telephone interview.
BlackRock, known more for its stock and bond funds, has been building up its infrastructure unit, which it started in 2011. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has told analysts this year that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to ""be one of the more significant"" drivers for BlackRock's business over the next few years.
The latest fundraising comes just over a year after BlackRock closed a deal to buy First Reserve Corp's Energy Infrastructure Funds unit, bringing over some of that company's existing funds and employees.

Overall, BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion in assets, including $41 billion on the ""real assets"" team that includes the energy infrastructure business.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",FM Capital Partners wins Libyan SWF fraud case against former CEO,"LONDON (Reuters) - FM Capital Partners (FMCP), which manages money for sovereign wealth fund the Libya Africa Investment Portfolio (LAP), has won a London court case against its former chief executive officer (CEO) over allegations of fraud and corruption.
As a result, FMCP may be able to recover about $20-$25 million, according to a statement issued by an FMCP spokesperson on Wednesday.
LAP is a subsidiary of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which has some $67 billion in assets and has brought several court cases against former investment managers. LAP was established in February 2006 and has about $5 billion under management with holdings in a number of African companies.
FMCP is a London-based alternative asset manager, which invested and managed some $550 million on behalf of LAP.
In the case, heard in London's Commercial Court in March 2018, FMCP alleged that between 2009 and 2014, its former CEO Frederic Marino and former Julius Baer banker Yoshiki Ohmura - a counterparty - funneled money away from FMCP and LAP through private offshore companies to fund lavish lifestyles. 
In 2014, after Marino was suspended, FMCP's board of directors began an investigation and reported the matter to the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Financial Conduct Authority, the statement said.
Marino was subsequently dismissed on grounds of gross misconduct, and FMCP issued legal proceedings against him. Around the same time, the NCA began a criminal investigation into Marino and Ohmura's conduct, which is still ongoing, the statement said. 
The judgment, handed down on Wednesday by Mrs Justice Sara Cockerill and seen by Reuters, found that during the period 2009-2014, Marino and Ohmura dishonestly funneled money away from FMCP and LAP. 
""As a matter of English law: Mr Marino is liable in breach of fiduciary duty, dishonest assistance and bribery in respect of all the heads advanced against him,"" Judge Cockerill said. 
She also found Ohmura liable in dishonest assistance and bribery in English law, stating that she was unable to accept ""significant portions"" of his evidence. 
A lawyer for Marino said the former FMCP CEO was ""extremely disappointed"" by the outcome, and was ""considering with his legal team the steps he should now take to vindicate his position"". 
Lawyers for Ohmura did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The court will meet again in late July to decide how much FMCP can recover from the defendants, according to FMCP's spokesperson.
The case is the latest in a string of litigation involving Libyan sovereign funds. In 2016 the LIA lost its legal battle against Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) after a seven-week trial relating to nine equity derivatives trades.
But in May 2017  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) agreed to pay the LIA nearly 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to settle a long-running dispute.

Exor (MI:EXOR), the investment holding of Italy's Agnelli family, owns nearly 30 percent of Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and 64 percent of Juventus. FCA and Juventus are completely separate entities, each managing their own finances and operations. 
Italian champions Juventus agreed on Tuesday to pay Real Madrid 100 million euros ($117 million) to secure the Portuguese striker for four years. Ronaldo has been world player of the year five times.
""It is unacceptable that while the (owners) ask workers of FCA ... for huge economic sacrifices for years, the same decide to spend hundreds of millions of euros for the purchase of a player,"" the USB union said in an emailed statement. 
Thousands of FCA plant workers across Italy have been on state-sponsored temporary layoff schemes for years due to lack of new models. However, the company has launched a new investment strategy to 2022 which it says should allow all employees in Italy to return to work by the end of 2022. 
The independent union, which is not part of the larger, national labor confederations, does not represent many workers at Melfi. The strike will be held late on Sunday to early Tuesday, the union added. 
""The owners should invest in car models that guarantee the future of thousands of people rather than enriching only one,"" the union said.
FCA and Exor declined to comment. 
The carmaker, whose plants churn out Jeep SUVs, sporty Alfa Romeos, luxury Maseratis and tiny Fiats, had promised to bring all employees in Italy back to work by the end of 2018, but that goal slipped as investments and product launches were delayed. 
Last month, FCA unveiled a new strategy to 2022, promising the goal of full employment would be reached by the end of the plan period.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's information regulator slapped Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with a small but symbolic fine for breaches of data protection law after millions of users' data was improperly accessed by consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
The 500,000 pound ($663,850) fine is less than 10 minutes worth of revenue for the social media firm worth $590 billion, whose shares were unchanged, but is the maximum amount allowed and represents the first move by a regulator to punish Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica controversy.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced questioning by U.S. and EU lawmakers over how the political consultancy obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher. The company has promised to introduce reforms to its policies before local elections in Britain next year.
Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said Facebook had broken the law by failing to safeguard people's information and had not been transparent about how data was harvested by others on its platform.
""New technologies that use data analytics to micro-target people give campaign groups the ability to connect with individual voters. But this cannot be at the expense of transparency, fairness and compliance with the law,"" she said in a statement.
Facebook said it was reviewing the report and would respond soon. It can respond to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) before a final decision on a fine is made. 
""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer, said in a statement, adding it was working closely with the ICO and authorities in the United States and other countries on investigations into the consultancy.
The fine is the maximum allowed under Britain's old data protection law, although that was replaced by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May, where companies can be fined up to 4 percent of revenue for breaches.
Charity Privacy International said that regulators were getting tougher on Facebook.
""Regulators have and are using their teeth. And as Facebook needs no reminding, under the EU's data protection law GDPR, regulators have much bigger and more significant powers, as well as the ability to issue far larger fines,"" said Frederike Kaltheuner, data exploitation program lead at the charity.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is still investigating Facebook, and is yet to penalize the company.
FAKE NEWS
British lawmakers have launched an inquiry into ""fake news"" and its effect on election campaigns, and have increasingly focused on Cambridge Analytica. The ICO said it was providing the interim report to help that inquiry.
""Given that the ICO is saying that Facebook broke the law, it is essential that we now know which other apps that ran on their platform may have scraped data in a similar way,"" Damian Collins, chair of the parliamentary inquiry, said.
Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump in 2016, has denied its work on the U.S. president's successful election campaign made use of data.
It has also said that, while it pitched for work with campaign group Leave.EU before the Brexit referendum in Britain in 2016, it did not end up doing any work on the campaign.
The ICO's report said other regulatory action would include a criminal prosecution against Cambridge Analytica's parent firm, SCL Elections, for failing to deal with the regulator's enforcement notice. 
It also said it would send warning letters to 11 political parties to compel them to audit their data protection practices.
It said it was investigating both leave and remain campaigners in the referendum, and that it had issued an enforcement notice for AIQ, a data firm that worked for official Brexit campaign Vote Leave, to stop processing retained data from British citizens.
David Carroll, an academic who is attempting to recover his data from Cambridge Analytica, said the report strengthened his legal challenge.
""Our day in British court may be within reach,"" he told Reuters in an email. 

""The fines may seem like rounding errors for Facebook ... But if American voters can somehow recover and repatriate our complete voter profiles then democracies will have won the day against dark data.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (O:FOXA) has raised its offer for Britain's Sky (L:SKYB) in an agreed deal valuing the pay-TV group at $32.5 billion, seeing off rival bidder Comcast (O:CMCSA) for now.
Fox, which has been trying to buy the pan-European group since December 2016, offered to pay 14 pounds per share, a 12 percent premium to Comcast's offer, but below the 15.05 pounds Sky shares were trading at on Wednesday.
Analysts said the bid threw down the gauntlet to Comcast, the world's biggest entertainment company, to return with a higher offer. 
The U.S. cable group gatecrashed Murdoch's attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky his group did not already own in February, when Fox was still firmly stuck in the regulatory process.
One top-40 Sky shareholder said they expected Comcast to come back with a counter bid for Sky.
""The end price really depends on the appetite of those companies and how much they are willing to take their leverage up and at what stage their shareholders say enough is enough,"" the shareholder, who did not wish to be identified, said.
The fight for Britain's leading pay-TV group is part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the world's media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Comcast and Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) are locked in a separate $70 billion-plus battle to buy most of Fox's assets, which would include Sky.
Disney secured conditional U.S. approval to buy the assets last month, giving it an edge over Comcast's bid.
Hong Kong-based hedge fund Case Equity Partners, a Sky investor, said the fact Disney was in a slightly more favorable position for Fox's U.S. media assets meant Comcast would fight even harder to get Sky.
""Today's Fox bid is unlikely to be the end game as we see a final Sky deal outcome at well over 15 pounds per share,"" said managing partner Michael Wegener.
Comcast declined to comment on Fox's new offer.
PRIME TIME DRAMA
Present in 23 million homes across Europe, Sky is a prized asset, with a slate of top sport and original drama content. 
""This transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world,"" Fox said. 
Its offer represents an 82 percent premium to Sky's shares in 2016 before the takeover drama started, and a multiple of 21 times 2017 earnings per share.
Sky's senior independent director Martin Gilbert welcomed the move. ""This offer reflects the strong position the business is in and is an attractive premium for shareholders,"" he said. 
However, British regulators have indicated that if Disney succeeds in buying Fox, including the 39 percent stake in Sky, it would be required to offer the same price for the remainder of Sky. According to some shareholders, that has set an implied higher floor for Sky's shares. 
Hedge funds including Elliott have bought into Sky in recent months and other vocal shareholders such as Crispin Odey have demanded that the independent directors secure a better deal.
""It's too low,"" Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch whose eponymous hedge fund is a Sky shareholder, said of the sweetened Fox offer. 
""Disney's internal forecasts now, on the basis of the cash flows they've published for Sky, would value it at 16 pounds,"" he said.
Fox said Disney had given its consent to the additional debt Fox would take on and said that it would reimburse Fox by around 1 billion pounds if Fox succeeds in buying Sky at that price, but the Disney-Fox transaction falls through. 
One hedge fund manager with a stake in Sky welcomed that pledge as a sign that Disney backed Fox in the battle. 
Fox said the performance of Sky since 2016 justified its new bid. Analysts said it was not a knock-out, and Fox did not say it was its final offer.
""Fox coming back in for Sky isn't a surprise in itself, but the fact the offer is slightly behind what some had anticipated brings another twist,"" said George Salmon, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
The British government is expected to finally allow Fox, which is run by Rupert's son James, to buy Sky this week, after the U.S. group agreed to sell Sky's award-winning news channel to Disney to prevent Murdoch from owning too much of the British media. 
Murdoch had previously tried to buy Sky in 2011 when a phone hacking scandal at his News of the World tabloid sparked a political backlash over his role in Britain. The opposition has not completely subsided despite the plan to spin off Sky News. 
""There are enough sub-plots in the race to acquire Sky to commission a prime time drama,"" Salmon said.

 The US administration late on Tuesday released a huge list of new products that tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China will be levied against.
The new 10% tariffs will apply to a huge amount of items including seafood and other fresh goods, according to the list released by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
""As a result of China’s retaliation [the introduction of tariffs on $US34 billion worth of US imports] and failure to change its practices, the President has ordered the US Trade Representative (USTR) to begin the process of imposing tariffs of 10% on an additional $US200 billion of Chinese imports,"" Lighthizer said.
That intensification of the trade skirmish, which is now being upgraded to a full-scale trade war by some commentators, has investors spooked about the future of the global world order, and the global economy, pushing stock markets around the world deep into the red.
 Market drops started in Asia overnight, where all of China and Hong Kong's share indices lost more than 1%. Turmoil then spread to Europe as markets open. In mid-afternoon trading, all major European indices are also nursing losses of more than 1%.
As US markets open, stocks stateside also fell, with the three major indices losing about 0.5% in the first few minutes of trade.
""Overnight, that unnerving trade war silence from the White House, which allowed stocks across the globe to charge higher in recent sessions, was broken. The US upped the stakes in the trade war with China, sending equity markets tumbling, as risk off prevails,"" Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group wrote in an email.
Here's the scoreboard of the biggest players in Europe as of 2:35 p.m. BST (9:35 a.m. ET):
Unfortunately for markets, no end is in sight, with further retaliatory levies almost certain to be enacted by China in the coming days or weeks.
After the list was released, China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it could not accept the additional tariffs proposed by the US, adding that it was ""shocked"" by the decision.
It also said that China would have to respond to the US actions.
Although the trade war obviously remains front and centre in the minds of investors, another factor at play is the nagging worry that Trump may want to pull the USA out of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) — a move that would represent a fundamental upheaval in the international order, and have a huge impact on markets."
93,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse nears $360 million deadline in fraud suit built on a hunch,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When the high-end property development Lake Las Vegas collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis, 31 funds that helped finance the project lost a total of $540 million. But only one of them, Dallas-based hedge fund Highland Capital Management, aggressively pursued legal action against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, which arranged the financing and appraisals for the project.
Highland ultimately convinced a Texas court that Credit Suisse had breached its contract and aided and abetted fraud in the deal, and the decision was upheld on appeal. Now, Credit Suisse faces a July 18 court deadline to pay Highland $360 million or appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.
The victories to date have enhanced the reputation of a fledgling Texas law firm, and legal experts say they are likely to encourage other investment funds to take big banks to court.
""This case shows the big banks can't hide behind disclaimers when they know certain facts,"" said Carol Gilden, a lawyer who represents pension funds and other institutional investors in financial and securities disputes.
Global banks have settled dozens of lawsuits by governments and shareholders over financial crisis misconduct, but until the Highland suit, it was unusual for an investment fund to pursue tough-to-win fraud actions - especially against a major trading partner, as Credit Suisse was for Highland. 
Highland, however, has a reputation for being more legally aggressive than many funds, and its general counsel, Scott Ellington, had a strong hunch that something was amiss with the deal. 
""When something is wrong I like to right it,"" Ellington told Reuters in an interview. 
The company had trouble finding someone willing to take the case, he said, in part because the legal firms it approached thought Ellington's suspicions would be tough to prove. Then, in 2010, Ellington met with Reid Collins & Tsai LLP, a newly-formed practice in Austin, Texas specializing in complex commercial disputes. The firm agreed to take the case on contingency. 
Many in the industry were surprised when Reid Collins & Tsai went on to win the case in 2015 and that a Dallas appeals court in February upheld the $287.5 million judgment. Since 2015, interest has accrued at an annual 9 percent. 
Credit Suisse, which has consistently denied liability for Highland's losses, ""respectfully disagrees"" with the court decisions and is seeking to appeal, spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said in a statement. The bank noted that it won an unrelated legal dispute with Highland in New York, and that another in Texas was dismissed.
'OASIS' OR MIRAGE?
Lake Las Vegas, billed in promotional materials as ""an oasis in the desert,"" was one of several ill-fated, high-end real estate projects for which Credit Suisse arranged syndicated loans during the run-up to the 2008 credit crisis.
The development was to include a luxurious golf community and resort with 9,000 homes and condominiums, two hotels, a casino, a shopping village and a 320-acre man-made lake.
Funds managed by Highland lent $250 million to the $540 million project in June, 2007 after being solicited by Credit Suisse, which agreed to provide an independent appraisal. That appraisal valued the property at $891 million.
When Lake Las Vegas filed for bankruptcy a year later, the liquidation value of the property was set at $23 million. The project has since been partially built by new developers, but early lenders like Highland lost their entire investment in the bankruptcy.
In the aftermath, Ellington said, he couldn't stop thinking about the original appraisal and wondering how a property could so quickly have lost so much value.
""When we got the case in 2010, we thought there was some reason to believe the appraisal was bad, and zero proof that we could pin Credit Suisse,"" Reid Collins & Tsai founding partner William T. Reid IV told Reuters.
BUILDING A CASE
As a first step, the law firm filed a lawsuit accusing the appraiser, CBRE, of artificially inflating land values and sales projections. In discovery, the firm obtained Credit Suisse's communications about those appraisals.
Highland settled its lawsuit against CBRE, which did not admit liability, in 2013, but materials obtained during discovery emboldened the company to also sue Credit Suisse.
An original, lower appraisal by CBRE had been changed after pressure from Credit Suisse, Highland alleged. 
The assertion was based in part on communication between CBRE appraiser William Acton and Credit Suisse's Arik Prawer, one of the Credit Suisse bankers involved with the deal.
""I reran the numbers as requested,"" Acton wrote in one email after a call with the Credit Suisse banking team. Highland maintained the emails showed Credit Suisse had manipulated the process and then took an overstated appraisal to lenders like Highland to convince them to back the loan. Acton died in September, 2007.
Credit Suisse argued that it was not responsible for verifying CBRE's appraisal and that disclaimers in the credit agreement barred Highland from pursuing claims.
Credit Suisse faces long odds in getting its case heard by the Texas Supreme Court. In the past five years, the court has only accepted 11.2 percent of the cases brought to it, according to annual statistical reports for the Texas judiciary analyzed by Reuters.
Of the cases the court does take, however, the justices reverse about 82 percent of the time, according to a 2012-2016 study by appellate lawyer Pamela Stanton Baron.

Meanwhile, a separate $350 million Highland lawsuit accusing Credit Suisse of fraud and breach of contract in six other land deals is still pending in New York.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 09:37AM ET</span>",U.S.-China trade row helped BASF land $10 billion Guangdong chemicals coup: sources,"By Michael Martina and Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn) managed to wrap up a preliminary deal to build China's first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex quite quickly, aided in part by trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The proposed complex, worth some $10 billion in investment to 2030, will be located in Guangdong, China's most populous province which had been worried about the impact of a U.S. decision to heavily penalize telecom firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), also based there. 
Fears that a U.S.-China trade war would hurt investment prospects for the business-friendly province made local government officials that much more receptive to overtures by BASF, a global giant with state-of-the art technology, separate people briefed on matter also said. 
BASF's announcement, part of $23 billion worth of bilateral deals unveiled as German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Berlin this week is conspicuous for its timing, trade and chemical industry experts said.
In reaching out to Europe, China is showing it is open for business as the trade row with Washington deepens.
BASF's coup, while still a rare example of a foreign player prising open the Chinese government's tight control over its energy and chemical industries, also follows measures by Beijing to lift some caps on foreign ownership in the auto and banking sectors.
""Now that we have this trade war that was kicked off last week, Beijing is telling Washington that it is still doing business and that there are capable companies around the world to do business with,"" said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore.
The outcomes of Li's visit, during which the widow of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize-winning political dissident Liu Xiaobo, left de facto house arrest in China to live in Germany, signaled a measured warming in what has been a bilateral relationship fraught with spying allegations and commercial mistrust.
China this week has also approved a huge new wholly owned Shanghai factory for U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), and a $2.3 billion joint venture organic light-emitting diode (OLED) plant to be built by South Korea's  LG Display  Co Ltd (KS:034220).
In contrast, the Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in the trade dispute, threatening 10 percent tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn it would be forced to retaliate.
ZTE HELPED
BASF's search for a potential site for its second major project in the world's largest chemical market had been in the works for a while, an industry insider with knowledge of the deal said. Like other sources, the industry insider declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The German firm had decided to go it alone rather than working with a state-owned partner as it had done previously and chose Guangdong as recently as three months ago, the person said, adding BASF had spied a ""window of opportunity"", banking on the province's desire for cutting-edge technology.
The person also said local governments had become more aware that they ""cannot not own everything"" and foreign investment could help them build what they wanted.
BASF's overtures coincided with a crisis for ZTE, slapped with a ban barring U.S. suppliers from selling it components after the firm broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE has had to curtail operations and is working to lift the ban.
""The ZTE case helped,"" the person said on Tuesday, without elaborating further.
BASF's media relations department said the company chose Guangdong for its first major investment in South China to tap the region's fast economic growth and declined to comment on whether ZTE's travails had helped speed up the decision-making.
Amid China's increased openness to foreign investment, BASF's knowledge of doing business in China meant it could ""seize the right opportunity at the right time"", a Beijing-based energy industry executive said.
RIVALS LAG
Under the agreement, BASF will explore building an integrated chemicals complex with petrochemicals plants and a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes per year of ethylene.
It is a chance to greatly expand in a Chinese chemicals market worth an estimated $1.5 trillion a year, feeding plastics, coatings and adhesives to the southern province's fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors.
By contrast, rival petrochemical giants have yet to strike wholly owned similar-sized deals in China - which accounts for around 40 percent of the world's chemical production. So far, they've stuck with joint ventures even though China eased restrictions on foreign ownership in the sector in 2011.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) started an expanded joint venture petrochemical plant in Huizhou in May with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) late last year signed a joint study memorandum of understanding with the government of Huizhou for a similar facility - although that agreement allows for the possibility of full ownership.
BASF plans to do a pre-feasibility study of its site by the end of the year, followed by a thorough analysis by end-2019 with construction estimated to start in 2023. The company aims to complete the first plants by 2026.
BASF's first major foray in China, nearly two decades ago, was a joint venture with state oil major Sinopec to build a $5.2 billion petrochemical complex in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.

The news comes a day after the company decided to defer drug price increases for no more than six months, following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump for raising list prices of some medicines.
The units would be Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. The company is currently split into two units - Innovative Medicines, which includes the consumer business, and Essential Health.
""This design gives us a sharper focus on diverse patients in diverse markets,"" Albert Bourla, chief operating officer said. 
The Innovative Medicines business will now also include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit, and together with the Consumer Healthcare business, will account for about three-quarters of the company's revenue. Pfizer's 2017 annual revenue was $52.55 billion.
Pfizer said it would still evaluate options for its consumer healthcare business and expects to make a decision in 2018. 
The company said in October last year that it was considering the sale or spin-off of the consumer healthcare business, which is worth about $15 billion. In May, Pfizer said that it had not received an acceptable offer.
The business consists of products ranging from Advil to lip balms. 
The Established Medicines unit would include the majority of the company's off-patent brands, including Viagra and neurological disease treatment Lyrica as well as some generic drugs.
The changes would be effective at the start of fiscal 2019.

Pfizer shares were flat at $37.40 in premarket trading.

Restaurant Brands (TO:QSR), which owns Tim Hortons as well as Burger King chains, said its Chinese restaurants will be opened under a master franchise joint venture with private equity firm Cartesian Capital Group.
""China's population and vibrant economy represent an excellent growth opportunity for Tim Hortons in the coming years,"" President Alex Macedo said in a statement.
China is a fast-growing market for coffee chains such as  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), with local startups like Luckin Coffee also vying for share of the market amid a burgeoning cafe culture.
Starbucks already has more than 3,000 stores in China, and said in May that it aims to triple China revenue and double cafe numbers to 6,000 by 2022.
Hortons, which has more than 4,700 outlets across the world, has seen sales fall over the past two years, with its brand reputation also taking a hit.
The chain was recently criticized for its reaction to minimum wage increases in Ontario, while a group of franchisees alleged that Restaurant Brands was not keeping to the terms of a 2014 deal to buy the chain.
In response, Restaurant Brands said in April it plans to spend C$700 million to revamp the coffee chain.

Hortons' partner in its China venture - Cartesian Capital - is already involved in Burger King's China operations.

The case relates to a check for 177.1 million dirhams ($48 million), signed by Naqvi and a fellow executive, and written to Hamid Jafar, another founding shareholder in Dubai-based Abraaj, a prosecution document showed.
The case in a Sharjah court had already been adjourned last week until Wednesday. Habib al-Mulla, the lawyer representing Naqvi, told Reuters last week that a settlement might be agreed.

Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] sold its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab in March in exchange for a stake in the Singapore-based firm.
The ministry said the land public transport agency received many complaints on Grab raising fares since the merger. Grab has become the region's sole dominant ride-hailing player.
Last week, Singapore's anti-trust body proposed fines on Grab and Uber, provisionally finding that their merger had reduced competition, and suggesting remedies such as the sale of their car-leasing businesses.
Malaysia's ride-hailing services will be regulated from Thursday, bringing them under the same regulation that the taxi industry is subjected to, transport minister Anthony Loke said in a press briefing.
""What is imposed on taxi drivers will also be imposed on e-hailing drivers, to get that driver's card,"" he told reporters, referring to health check-ups, car inspection and permits.
Ride-hailing drivers are given a one-year moratorium to fulfill the requirements.
""We know this is not a measure that will please all parties but we take a more balanced approach that can regulate e-hailing and create a level-playing field of competition among e-hailing and taxi drivers,"" Loke said.
The monopoly review will be conducted by the Malaysia Competition Commission, the ministry said in a statement.

Grab representatives were not immediately available to comment on the matter.

""The company will cooperate with the DoJ, while continuing to focus on our business and seeking to maximize the value we create for our diverse stakeholders in a responsible and transparent manner,"" Hayward said.
""Glencore takes ethics and compliance seriously throughout the group,"" the chairman said. 
Switzerland-based Glencore received a subpoena from the DoJ last week requesting documents and records on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money-laundering statutes.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for companies to bribe overseas officials to win business.
The DOJ has so far not commented on the request.
Glencore shares had fallen 4.2 percent to 313.29 pence by 0921 GMT, down 20 percent since the start of 2018 and close to one-year lows. The stock suffered its biggest one-day fall in more than two years after the subpoena announcement last week.
Responding to the share fall, Glencore announced a buy back worth $1 billion in an effort to soothe investors.
Some analysts say the U.S subpoena could be a result of Glencore settling a mining row in Congo with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, under U.S. sanctions since last year, by agreeing to pay royalties in euros.
Congo accounts for about 25 percent of Glencore's net present value, analysts said, adding that Venezuela and Nigeria's contribution was negligible. The firm mines cobalt in Congo, a key metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles.

NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian airline Vistara has placed firm orders for six  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 jets and 13 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320neos valued at $3.1 billion at list prices, as it looks to add more domestic flights and launch international routes later this year.
The order for Boeing's 787s marks a new setback for Airbus in an intense battle for widebody orders as the European planemaker seeks to strengthen the order book for its upgraded A330neo passenger jet. 
Boeing posted figures on Tuesday showing a significant lead in new orders over its European rival, buoyed by demand for the 787 following a series of showdowns against the A330neo. 
Airbus said last week it saw good demand for the upgraded jet and is expected to announce orders soon. The Farnborough Airshow, which typically attracts large numbers of airline orders, will be held in Britain next week.
Vistara joins rival Jet Airways (NS:JET) and low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) that have plans to grow their international operations to offset a highly competitive, price-sensitive domestic market.
""India's position as the world's fastest growing domestic aviation market and its impressive growth in air passenger traffic that has more than doubled over the last decade makes us confident of our aggressive plans for domestic expansion and international foray,"" Vistara CEO Leslie Thng said in a statement on Wednesday.
The joint venture between India's Tata Sons Ltd and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), said it would procure another 37 A320neos from leasing companies and also had purchase rights over 4 more 787-9s and options over 7 more A320neos.
The purchased and leased Airbus jets, fitted with CFM International LEAP engines, will be delivered between 2019 and 2023. The Boeing jets, to be powered by GE (N:GE) engines and used for medium and long-haul flights, are expected in 2020 and 2021.
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
There is huge potential for international travel from India, where the domestic aviation market has grown about 20 percent annually in recent years.
Only 0.3 percent of the 1.3 billion population currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million Indians who could potentially afford to do so, according to an analysis of household income by aviation consultancy CAPA. 
CAPA expects Vistara to place another large widebody order within the next 1-2 years and also expects InterGlobe Aviation's (NS:INGL) IndiGo to pursue an ""aggressive international strategy"" by soon announcing a large order.
""India will see closer to 100 wide-body orders in next 1-2 years indicating a strong international strategy,"" said Kapil Kaul, CEO and director for South Asia at CAPA.

Jet Airways placed a firm order in June for 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, taking the total to 225 new aircraft which it expects to add to its fleet over the next decade.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","China's vehicle sales rise 4.8 percent in June, sustaining upswing","By Fang Cheng and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Auto sales in China rose 4.8 percent in June from a year earlier to 2.27 million vehicles, an industry association said on Wednesday, as demand remained on the upswing in the face of concerns such as the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade spat.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said overall sales during the first half of 2018 were up 5.6 percent from the same period a year prior, totaling 14.1 million vehicles.
Last month's sales rise followed a 9.6 percent increase in May and 11.5 percent growth in April. Auto sales in China, the world's biggest vehicle market, have been rebounding steadily since February when sales volume fell 11.1 percent.
Xu Haidong, CAAM assistant secretary general, told reporters the association was keeping its forecast for the year unchanged.
It had projected in January market growth of 3 percent this year, in line with 2017 but significantly below the 13.7 percent gain in 2016.
Still, because the market saw faster-than-expected growth in the first six months of the year, CAAM is in essence forecasting slower growth in the rest of year.
One official, Chen Shihua, said he and others at CAAM ""are concerned about pressures in the second half"".
Neither Chen nor Xu would elaborate, but one source of pressure appeared would be ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States.
After China raised tariff rates on U.S.-made vehicles imported into China earlier this month in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's heavier duties on Chinese goods, Xu said ""BMW and Mercedes will be affected"".
On July 6, the United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other's imports, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war"" ever in a sharp escalation of their months-long conflict.
The higher tariffs on U.S.-made cars levied by Beijing have already forced electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) to raise prices on cars Tesla brings into China.
Among other foreign automakers that could announce price increases in China are BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz.
BMW said last week it was unable to ""completely absorb"" the new tariffs, hinting at possible price hikes on cars it sells in China in the near future.
CAAM said sales in China of so-called new-energy vehicles jumped 42.9 percent in June from a year earlier to about 84,000 vehicles.
That took sales of new-energy vehicles - essentially all-electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrids - to about 412,000 vehicles for January-June, up 111.6 percent from the same period a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Wednesday as an escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute looked set to bring a six-session winning streak to an end.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 1.1 percent by 0905 GMT, while Germany's export-heavy DAX (GDAXI) fell 1.2 percent.
The Trump administration raised the stakes in the standoff with Beijing by threatening to impose 10 percent tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move that hit risky assets globally.
Though investors have been looking positively toward the second-quarter earnings season, the increasingly uncompromising rhetoric on trade has weighed on equities recently.
""It's getting a bit more real for markets now,"" Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said, referring to the United States' threat of more tariffs.
""It's more difficult to dismiss this on the basis that ... little has happened in real terms,"" Odeluga added.
All European sectors were in negative territory, with those most exposed to action on tariffs taking the most points off the STOXX. Basic resources (SXPP) was down 3.1 percent and autos (SXAP) down 1.7 percent.
With the earnings season about to get into gear, trading updates put individual stocks into focus.
Shares in Indivior (L:INDV) plunged almost a third after the drugmaker said its 2018 profit would come in below its forecast, hurt by the launch of generic versions of its bestselling opioid addiction treatment in the United States. 
 Micro Focus  (L:MCRO) was another large faller, down 7.5 percent after the software company gave a half-year update, with analysts at Investec saying that they still see ""material challenges ahead for the business"". 
Micro Focus' shares are down more than 52 percent this year. 
Shares in  Burberry  (L:BRBY) were down 3.7 percent after the luxury retailer's first quarter update failed to impress investors, with no outlook hike.
""Cost cuts and other strategic initiatives are still ongoing and should be welcomed by investors,"" Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said.
""But strategies, such as taking the brand even more upmarket, have the potential to backfire and alienate traditional customers as we have seen with other brands in the industry,"" Miah added.
UK housebuilder  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV) rose 1.4 percent after the company said that it expected profits to have risen 9 percent in 2018.

In M&A news, shares in UK broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB) retreated 0.8 percent after Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (O:FOXA) said it had agreed a $32.5 billion bid for Sky, trumping a rival offer from U.S. group Comcast (O:CMCSA).

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's stocks slumped Wednesday after three days of gains and the yuan weakened as the United States threatened more import duties on Chinese goods, sharply escalating the trade conflict between the world's two biggest economies.
China's commerce ministry said it was ""shocked"" by Washington's latest move, which comes just days after both countries imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods, and ups the ante in a heated trade dispute that has rattled global financial markets.
The Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) fell 1.8 percent, and the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) dropped 1.7 percent.
Investors have been particularly worried that the trade row could harm an already slowing Chinese economy in a blow to global investment and growth. Analysts said domestic concerns would also weigh on shares.
""Judging from (China's) economic fundamentals and corporate earnings expectations, which are under pressure amid the trade war with the United States, the stock market is yet to reach a bottom,"" said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities.
Beijing's commitment to its ongoing deleveraging campaign means that tight credit conditions will continue, Yan said. 
State media cast news of new tariffs and slumping shares in a different light.
The news could ""bring some negative emotion to financial markets in the short term, but over the long run, fundamentals of Chinese financial markets have not changed, and (investors) shouldn't over-value its impact,"" Guan Tao, former director of the international payments department at China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) was quoted as saying by the state-owned Xinhua news agency.
Airline shares, which have suffered in recent weeks amid rising oil prices and a falling yuan, were hit particularly hard on Wednesday. Investors fear that a falling yuan could add to fuel costs and the debt-servicing load of companies with dollar-denominated debts.
China Southern Airlines (SS:600029) and Air China (SS:601111) fell more than 6 percent, and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) dropped 5.7 percent. The broader CSI300 transport sub-index <.CSI300TRANS> lost 2.6 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) fell 1.3 percent, with the China Enterprises index (HSCE) giving up 1.5 percent.
Investors were wary of China response to the latest U.S. tariff threat, as the country's assistant commerce minister said the proposed U.S. duties harm the World Trade Organization system and globalization.
""It is impractical for China to match tariffs by quantity,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. ""If the U.S. goes ahead with more, China needs a combination of tools and it is prudent to guard against downside risk to growth too.""
She said the downside risk to growth mainly stemmed from trade tensions.
RISK TO EXPORTS 
The threat of additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods ""would mean that around half of Chinese exports of goods to the U.S. would face significant U.S. punitive tariff measures,"" Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist at IHS Markit, said in a note. 
""China's export sector will therefore suffer a significant deterioration in export competitiveness to the U.S. compared to other emerging markets' manufacturing exporters.""
The trade war anxiety extended to China's yuan. Traders said they were keeping an eye on the key 6.7 per dollar level as pressure mounted on the currency.
However, the market wasn't aggressively testing that level due to concerns it could prompt intervention, they said.
Several traders said they saw some dollar selling by large state banks in the spot market, which went some way to supporting the yuan, though they did not know whether U.S. dollar liquidity offered by the banks was on behalf of the central bank or corporate clients.
The onshore yuan  opened at 6.6694 per dollar and was at 6.6674 at the official domestic close, down 0.4 percent for the day.

The offshore yuan  was at 6.6848 per dollar at 0831GMT after hitting a low of 6.6918, down nearly 0.5 percent on the day, at one point in early Asian trade. Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most-traded contract, gained 0.34 percent to 95.830.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks and insurers must take the lead in spelling out how they will use data collected from customers or they could face new rules, Financial Conduct Authority Chair Charles Randell said on Wednesday.
The use of Big Data requires good communication so that consumers understand and accept a firm's approach to using their data and don't end up being ""disenfranchised"", Randell said.
In the financial sector, insurers are looking to ramp up their use of big data, including social media use, to price motor or home insurance more accurately, rewarding customers considered lower risk, such as due to good driving habits.
Some insurers offer lower health insurance premiums based on regular gym attendance.
""By good communication, I don’t mean pages and pages of obscure disclosures, disclaimers and consents. I mean short and readable statements which make it clear what firms will and won’t do with their customers’ data,"" Randell told a Reuters Newsmaker event.
""These need to be developed with consumers, not imposed on them,"" Randell said in his first major speech since becoming chair of the FCA in April.
""A number of firms do this already but many do not. Should all businesses have a data charter? Should these be developed through voluntary codes of practice? Will the industry take the lead or should they be a regulatory requirement?""
In September 2016, the FCA dropped plans for a formal review of whether Big Data might make it harder or more expensive for some customers to buy a car or home insurance, but said it would look at the risk of some customers being excluded.
Randell said the power of Big Data corporations and their central place in providing services that are now essential in everyday lives raise significant questions about the adequacy of global frameworks for competition and regulation.
Britain's information regulator said on Wednesday it intends to fine Facebook (O:FB) 500,000 pounds ($663,550), the maximum possible, for breaches of data protection law as the watchdog investigates how millions of users' data was improperly accessed by consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
""The ordinary consumer may in practice have no choice in whether to deal with these corporations on terms which are non-negotiable and are often too general to be well understood. And without access to the data which consumers have signed – or clicked – away, new businesses may find it very difficult to compete,"" Randell said.
""If you add all these factors together, they call into question the adequacy of the traditional liberal approach to the relationship between financial services firms and their customers. And regulation is central because it will help define whether AI and Big Data liberate customers, or disenfranchise them.""

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said that the Japanese unit of Apple had forced NTT Docomo Inc (T:9437) , KDDI Corp (T:9433) and SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) to offer subsidies and sell iPhones at a discount.
""Obliging carriers to offer subsidies (for iPhones) could have prevented the carriers from offering lower monthly charges and restricted competition,"" the FTC said in a statement.
The FTC, which began looking into Apple's sales practices in 2016, did not punish Apple as the U.S. company had agreed to revise its contracts with the carriers, it said.
Apple representatives in Japan were not immediately available for comment.
The U.S. company accounts for one in every two smartphones sold in Japan, according to MM Research Institute Ltd, making Japan one of its most profitable markets.
The carriers sold the iPhones at a discount, the FTC said, giving Apple an advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
In order to make up for the losses, they locked consumers into lucrative two- and four-year contracts, the watchdog said.

In revising the contracts, Apple has agreed to allow the carriers to offer customers a choice of buying iPhones without subsidies but paying lower monthly charges, the FTC said.

Earlier this year, China said it would scrap foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018 and all automotive ventures by 2022. The announcement marked a major policy shift in the world's top car market that has capped foreign ownership in the sector at 50 percent for over two decades.
Huang Ou, deputy director of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology, told reporters at a press conference that the city government was engaged in preparations to support the Tesla project, set to be Shanghai's biggest foreign-invested project.
""The next step is for the city government to do the support work to allow the project to go into operation as quickly as possible,"" he said.
""In line with state plans, we will speed up the cancellation of foreign ownership restrictions in the car manufacturing sector,"" he said.
Huang declined to comment, however, on the size of the project or when the construction of a plant with capacity to produce 500,000 Tesla battery electric cars a year - large by auto industry standards - would start.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk landed a deal on Tuesday to build a new and wholly owned auto plant in Shanghai, the company's first factory outside the United States. It would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.
The deal was announced as Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China to offset the cost of tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S. imports in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's heavier duties on Chinese goods.
An auto assembly plant half the size of the envisioned Tesla Shanghai plant would normally cost $1 billion to build, according to automotive industry officials and experts.
The Shanghai government said in a statement on Tuesday it welcomed Tesla’s move to invest not only in a new factory in the city but in research and development.

Chinese magazine Caijing, citing sources close to the project, reported on Tuesday that the plant's exact location had not been decided and construction would start early next year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will set up a China business desk in India within the year betting on a pickup in investment flows within the Asian region, its Asia-Pacific corporate banking head said, as concerns grow about the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war.
Citi plans to establish the desk in Mumbai, adding to a South Korea business desk in the capital New Delhi, Gerald Keefe told Reuters. The desks provide services such as trade finance, corporate loans, cash management and investment banking.
Chinese firms, mainly from tech and pharmaceutical sectors, have been looking to deepen their push into growth markets such as India, with its rising middle-class income and increased spending on big-ticket goods, bankers have said.
The drive comes as the United States imposes tariffs on Chinese imports, with China responding in kind. In the latest battle, the United States on Tuesday added 10 percent duty to $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Investors fear a protracted trade war will be detrimental to global growth, but Keefe said investment and trade is growing elsewhere across Asia, and that Citi intends to capitalize through its banking network.
The Wall Street bank's revenue from institutional business in intra-Asia trade corridors has risen 33 percent so far this year versus the same period a year prior, and compared with 18 percent for all of 2017, Keefe said.
""There's an increasing and absolute amount of investment flow around Asia right from companies that are headed out of China, from companies that are headquartered elsewhere in Asia who are of scale,"" Keefe said in a recent interview.
Citi has about 20 business desks supporting investments by companies from China, South Korea and India, into places including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Hanoi, as well as New York, London and Johannesburg.
Plans for additional China desks in Europe and Africa are being finalised, Keefe said.
""Obviously it's not helpful to have terms (such as) 'global trade war' in the news every day,"" he said. 
""(But) as clients evaluate what all this means in the context of these trade relations being reset, we are finding that they are concluding that additional time, effort, energy and investment in Asia is good for them.""
Keefe said there was growing investment from China in India, where global automakers are raising production capacity, as well as in Southeast Asia in sectors such as technology, real estate and healthcare.
There is also growing investment from South Korea in India, where  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) on Monday opened what it called the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturing plant. 
Citi's institutional banking revenue from the South Korea-India business corridor has risen 78 percent this year. 

""The macro setup for Asia has been as good as it possibly could have been for the last couple of years, and that has encouraged a lot of outbound investments and a lot of incremental trade has come through those corridors,"" Keefe said.

153,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Stumble as U.S. Threatens New Tariffs on China,"Investing.com – Asian equities tumbled in afternoon trade on Wednesday after the Trump administration threaten to impose tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.
The 10% tariffs will not take effect immediately but will undergo a two-month review process. The proposed list of goods includes consumer items such as clothing, television components and refrigerators as well as other technology products.
In response, China's commerce ministry said in a statement released around midday on Wednesday that it was ""shocked"" by the latest U.S. trade action and urged international community to work together against the trade bullying, while calling the actions ""completely unacceptable"".
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a senior member of Trump's Republican Party, said the announcement ""appears reckless and is not a targeted approach.""
“Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200 billion worth of products will raise the costs of every day goods for American families, farmers, ranchers, workers, and job creators. It will also result in retaliatory tariffs, further hurting American workers,"" a Chamber spokeswoman said.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 1.8% and 2.3% lower on Wednesday following the news. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 1.3%.
Louis Kuijs, Hong Kong-based Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, said while China’s policy response is likely to be limited for now.
""In part because they have only limited ammunition and in part because it's still early in the process on the U.S. side,"" Kuijs said.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.1% in afternoon trade. The country’s core machinery orders fell 3.7% in May, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday, compared with economists' median estimate of a 5.5% drop. It followed a 10.1% rise in April.
SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son said he was confident that his company’s operations would not be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's escalation of trade disputes and heightened scrutiny of foreign investments.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2018 01:05AM ET</span>",Stock markets roiled as U.S. ups ante in trade conflict,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - A sell-off in Chinese markets knocked Asian stocks on Wednesday as U.S. threats of tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods pushed the world's two biggest economies ever closer to a full-scale trade war.
Washington proposed the extra tariffs after efforts to negotiate a solution to the dispute failed to reach an agreement, senior administration officials said on Tuesday.
The United States had just imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday, drawing immediate retaliatory duties from Beijing on U.S. imports in the first shots of a heated trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump had warned then that his country may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese imports - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
""With no early end appearing to be in sight for the escalating 'tit-for-tat' world trade frictions and rising trade protectionism, global trade wars have become one of the key downside risks to world growth and trade in the second half of 2018 and for 2019,"" wrote Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent. The index had gained for the past two sessions, having enjoyed a lull from the trade war fears that lashed global markets last week.
Spreadbetters expected the Asian gloom to extend to European stocks, with Britain's FTSE tipped to open down 0.45 percent, Germany's DAX 0.6 percent and France's CAC 0.5 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 1.5 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.8 percent.
S&P 500 and Dow futures were down 0.7 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, pointing to a lower open for Wall Street later in the day.
South Korea's KOSPI lost 0.55 percent and Japan's Nikkei fell 1 percent.
""The markets still remain sensitive to the trade-related theme, which is something investors have to take into account for the long term,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Tokyo.
""At the same time, the trade dispute can easily be blamed for a variety of ills. But it could mask over factors that could also weigh on equities in the longer run, such as tighter monetary policies led by the United States.""
Investors worry a full-blown Sino-U.S. trade conflict could hurt global exports, investment and growth.
The yen, often sought in times of political tensions and market turmoil, gained against a number of peers.
The dollar traded at 111.02 yen, pulled back from a near two-month peak of 111.355.
The euro fell 0.2 percent to 130.175 yen and the Australian dollar lost 0.7 percent to 82.24 yen.
The Aussie, considered a liquid proxy for China-related trades, fell 0.7 percent against the dollar to $0.7408.
China's yuan lost 0.45 percent against the dollar and back toward an 11-month low plumbed last week.
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 3 basis points to 2.84 percent, pulling back sharply from a one-week peak of 2.875 percent scaled the previous day.
Oil prices declined after the United States said it would consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions it will put into effect in November that prevents Iran from exporting oil. [O/R]
Brent crude futures lost 0.8 percent to $78.22 a barrel. Oil had risen the previous day, supported by a larger-than expected U.S. stock draw and supply concerns in Norway and Libya.
Industrial metals sank with the trade war threatening global growth. 
Copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) sank roughly 3 percent to brush $6,092.50 per ton, lowest since July 2017, before pulling back a little to $6,165.00.

LME zinc fell as much as 4.8 percent to $2,503 per ton, its lowest since June 2017.

155,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",SoftBank's Son says to carry on with deals despite trade jitters,"By Carl O'Donnell
SUN VALLEY, IDAHO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) CEO Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday he was optimistic that U.S. President Donald Trump's escalation of trade disputes and heightened scrutiny of foreign investments would not affect the Japanese firm's prolific dealmaking.
Trump's administration has been slapping trade tariffs on Chinese goods and blocking Chinese investments in the United States it deems a threat to U.S. national security. 
SoftBank, which has links to China through investments such as internet giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), has seen its U.S. deals facing protracted regulatory reviews as a result.
""Our investments are innocent,"" Son told reporters in Sun Valley, Idaho, where investment bank Allen & Co is hosting an annual get-together for technology, telecommunications and media executives.
SoftBank and its Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund which in May last year raised over $93 billion, have made many investments in U.S. technology firms, including ride-hailing firm Uber and share-office space firm WeWork. The fund has raised tens of billions of dollars from sovereign wealth funds in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
Last year, SoftBank bought Fortress https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fortress-inv-glo-m-a-softbank-group/softbank-to-buy-fortress-investment-for-3-3-billion-idUSKBN15T333 Investment Group but agreed to run the private equity firm at an arm's length to win permission from the Committee on Foreign Investment, a U.S. national security panel, to proceed with the acquisition. 
Son also told reporters on Tuesday he was not interested in doing any ""traditional media"" acquisitions, even as U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) is looking for partners to strengthen its bid for media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) has agreed to sell to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS). 

Son said he is instead going to continue to focus on the areas where SoftBank has made some of its biggest investments, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics and ride sharing.

The 10% tariffs will not kick in immediately but will undergo a two-month review process, with hearings Aug. 20-23., according to a statement from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office Tuesday. The proposed list of goods includes consumer items such as clothing, television components and refrigerators as well as other technology products.
“For over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in announcing the proposed tariffs.
“China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk. Rather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against U.S. products. There is no justification for such action.”
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component opened 1.7% and 2.5% lower on Wednesday following the news. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 2.0%.
The latest news on the trade front came after Washington slapped 25% tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports last week, a move against which China immediately retaliated with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
""American families are the ones being punished. Consumers, businesses and the American jobs dependent on trade, are left in the crosshairs of an escalating global trade war,” said Hun Quach, the head of international trade policy for the group.
“This latest story will serve as a reality check for the market, reminding investors to reconsider how aggressive they want to be,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “Regardless, the $200 billion in potential additional tariffs is not a surprise. The President made everyone well aware of them.”
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.7% in morning trade. The country’s core machinery orders fell 3.7% in May, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday, compared with economists' median estimate of a 5.5% drop. It followed a 10.1% rise in April.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new auto plant in Shanghai, its first factory outside the United States, that would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.
The deal was announced as Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China to offset the cost of new tariffs imposed by the Chinese government in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's heavier duties on Chinese goods.
Musk was in Shanghai Tuesday, and the Shanghai government in a statement said it welcomed Tesla's move to invest not only in a new factory in the city, a center of the Chinese auto industry, but in research and development, as well. China has long pushed to capture more of the talent and capital invested by global automakers in advanced electric vehicle technology. 
Tesla plans to produce the first cars about two years after construction begins on its Shanghai factory, ramping up to as many as 500,000 vehicles a year about two to three years later, the company said. 
That would make Tesla's Shanghai plant large by auto industry standards, where most factories are tooled to build 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year, and roughly equivalent to the planned annual production at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California. 
Tesla shares rose 1.5 percent in U.S. trading even as some analysts questioned where the money-losing company will get the capital required to build and staff such a large plant. 
Musk has said Tesla will be cash-flow positive this year. Analysts have predicted it will raise capital to fund a list of new projects, including launching an electric semi truck, a pickup truck, a compact SUV and new battery and vehicle production facilities that Musk has proposed for China and Europe.
""I am sure that Tesla needs fresh money at the latest next year,"" said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB.
The Shanghai government suggested it could help with some of the capital costs. ""The Shanghai municipal government will fully support the construction of the Tesla factory,"" its statement said.
Tesla said Tuesday’s announcement will not impact U.S. manufacturing operations, which continue to grow.
MUSK'S PURSUIT OF A CHINA PLANT
China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and most forecasters predict that electric vehicle sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as government regulation drives toward a goal of 100-percent electric vehicles by 2030.
More than 28 million vehicles were sold in China last year, and annual sales are forecast to top 35 million by 2025. That would be more than double the current U.S. market, where new light vehicle sales run at about 17 million vehicles a year.
Musk was talking about building a Chinese factory long before the Trump administration proposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. China until recently levied 25-percent tariffs on imported cars, and for decades automakers have been moving to build more vehicles in the markets where they are sold to neutralize currency shifts and trade policy reversals.
Chinese authorities' decision to grant Tesla permission to move forward lands as President Trump is fighting to stop U.S. manufacturers from responding to his trade policy by shifting production overseas, as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said it would do last month.
Against the backdrop of trade conflict with Washington, China is using its power to draw investment from the global auto industry. German automakers on Monday and Tuesday dominated a list of deals between China and Germany focused on the development of electric vehicles and technology for connectivity and self-driving cars.
BMW (DE:BMWG) agreed with partner Brilliance Automotive Group Holdings (HK:1114) to up production capacity at joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive to 520,000 BMW brand vehicles in 2019.
Capacity at BMW Brilliance Automotive's (BBA) two production sites will outstrip BMW's U.S. plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for the first time. BMW said last week it would be unable to fully absorb a new Chinese 25-percent tariff on imported U.S.-made models and would have to raise prices on the vehicles it makes in Spartanburg.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), meanwhile, said it will cooperate with China's FAW Group (SZ:000800) on technologies including e-mobility, connectivity and autonomous cars.
Tesla has been in protracted negotiations to open its own factory in China to help bolster its position in the country's fast-growing market for electric cars and to avoid high import tariffs. 
Tesla hiked prices in China over the weekend to a level more than 70 percent higher than in the United States amid mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing that have seen several U.S. imports, including cars, subjected to retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent.
Musk had previously criticized China's tough auto rules for foreign businesses, which would have required it to cede a 50-percent share in the factory. After China announced in May that it planned to scrap by 2022 the rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle ventures, Tesla registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai.

""The Shanghai plant will certainly improve Tesla’s positioning in China and allow it to locally produce and avoid import tariffs. The relaxation of the 50/50 rule for JVs in China uniquely benefits Tesla because they did not have an existing JV in China"" as rivals do, said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Pfizer delays drug price hikes after talking with Trump,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Michael Erman
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said on Tuesday it was deferring drug price increases for no more than six months after the company's chief executive officer had an extensive conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump.
The rollback came a day after Trump took aim at Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers for raising prices on some of their medicines, saying in a tweet that they ""should be ashamed"" and that his administration would respond.
Pfizer on Tuesday said it would defer price increases that went into effect on July 1 until the end of the year or until the president's drug pricing blueprint goes into effect - whichever is sooner. The company said it would return drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible.
On Tuesday, Trump said in a tweet that Pfizer had agreed to roll back drug price hikes after he and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar spoke with the company's CEO, Ian Read.
""We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same,"" Trump, who is traveling in Europe, said in a tweet.
Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, now likely will not raise drug prices until after the 2018 midterm elections in November. That gives Trump, who made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue, a short-term victory he can point to in the run-up to the elections, which are being closely watched to see if Trump's fellow Republicans will be able to maintain control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Pfizer raised list prices on around 40 medicines earlier this month. Those include Viagra, cholesterol drug Lipitor and arthritis treatment Xeljanz, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). List prices do not include rebates and discounts drugmakers may offer.
The Trump administration has not yet taken significant action to lower drug prices. Azar has said lowering prices long term will take years because of the complexity of the healthcare system.
Trump rolled out a blueprint in May on how his administration planned to lower drug prices. Trump said in May that some drug companies would announce ""voluntary, massive"" price decreases in two weeks, though none have materialized yet.
Pharmaceutical company shares rose after Trump unveiled his drug pricing blueprint.

Azar praised Pfizer on Tuesday. ""I commend Pfizer for its constructive and professional approach, and its desire to work with President Trump to be part of the solution and not part of the problem,"" he said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London is launching a matching site to make it easier for its brokers and insurers to find one another, as Britain's commercial insurance market seeks to embrace technology and cut costs.
Lloyd's Bridge will enable Lloyd's cover-holders - brokers or other insurance firms around the world allowed to offer Lloyd's insurance - to go online to seek insurance from the 80-plus syndicates operating in the Lloyd's market.
The syndicates can also use the site to find cover-holders to sell their policies.
The site will operate in a similar way to Airbnb or dating websites and will enable Lloyd's syndicates to cut distribution costs, Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters by phone.
""At the moment, the distribution chain can be quite extended - that imposes costs and inefficiency on the way we do things,"" he said, adding that the site was ""a way for us to reach small, more regional, brokers and underwriters in international markets"".
Lloyd's, which started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688, has a face-to-face market in the City of London for the insurance of complex risks.
It is looking for ways to become more efficient after suffering a 2 billion pound ($2.7 billion) loss last year.
It is also moving to electronic processing of trades, setting up Lloyd's Lab to encourage insurtech and pushing syndicates to exit loss-making businesses.
""We have a number of syndicates... that have lost money consistently over the last few years - we are asking them to be more aggressive about restructuring this business,"" Carnegie-Brown said.
Lloyd's is also in the process of hiring a new chief executive, after announcing last week that Inga Beale will step down.
Carnegie-Brown said he hoped to hire someone with international and previous CEO experience and insurance knowledge, who was ""capable of continuing the transformation we've got going"".
Lloyd's Bridge will pilot in Britain, Australia and New Zealand from Wednesday, ahead of a full launch in 2019, Lloyd's said in a statement.
In Europe, Lloyd's is focusing on preparing for Brexit through its Brussels subsidiary, Carnegie-Brown said.
It has a six-strong executive team in place and has hired 12-15 of the 40 staff it needs to start underwriting business on Jan. 1, he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose on Tuesday to post its highest closing level since Feb. 1, the day before the market began a sharp extended selloff, as strong results from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) boosted optimism about the earnings season.
The consumer staples index climbed 1.3 percent and provided the biggest lift to the S&P 500, driven by PepsiCo, which gained 4.8 percent, while Procter & Gamble rose 2.5 percent and Coca-Cola was up 1.3 percent. 
Recent upbeat news on the economy as well as earnings have helped to offset worries about escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. The two countries slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods on Friday. 
Concerns over trade resurfaced after Tuesday's close, with S&P futures falling late after a Trump administration official said the White House is likely to announce a list of $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods as early as Tuesday night.
""It's not an inconsequential move,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco, of the decline in futures. ""This trade war escalating is not good news, and the market won't see it as good news.""
S&P 500 e-mini futures ended the session down 0.1 percent and were off 0.8 percent after trading resumed for the overnight session. 
During the regular session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.07 points, or 0.58 percent, to end at 24,919.66, while the Nasdaq Composite added 3.00 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,759.20. The S&P 500 gained 9.67 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,793.84.
The S&P 500 index has risen about 3 percent in the last four sessions. It is now up 4.5 percent since the end of 2017 and is less than 3 percent from its Jan. 26 record high. Worries over rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation drove the early February selloff, which confirmed a correction for the market.
Earnings are expected to become key for investors in the coming weeks as the U.S. reporting period kicks into high gear. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are scheduled to report results on Friday. Their shares dipped on Tuesday after leading market gains on Monday.
PepsiCo's shares surged after the company's quarterly results topped estimates on strong sales of snacks. The company also reaffirmed its full-year forecast amid signs of a gradual recovery in its soda business.
Overall, S&P 500 companies are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, slightly higher than what was forecast in April, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Also boosting the S&P on Tuesday, utilities and telecom indexes rose about 1 percent each, bouncing back from Monday's losses.
Higher oil prices lifted energy shares. The S&P energy index rose 0.7 percent as crude oil prices gained on growing supply disruptions in Norway and Libya, but gains were pared after the United States said it would consider requests for waivers from Iranian oil sanctions.
Shares of Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were up around 1 percent each. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>","Boeing's first-half deliveries up seven percent, orders surge past Airbus","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) first-half aircraft deliveries rose more than 7 percent, lifted by demand for its bestselling 737 jetliners as airlines seek more fuel-efficient planes, and orders were more than double those of European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
The announcement on Tuesday caps a successful half year for the world's largest planemaker and comes a week ahead of the Farnborough Airshow in Britain, where airlines typically place orders.
Chicago-based Boeing had 460 net aircraft orders in the first half of 2018, compared with Airbus's 206, rebounding after losing that race to Airbus last year. 
Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because that's when airlines pay over most of the money, while orders give a better glimpse of planemakers' prospects.
Boeing said its in-house financing arm, Boeing Capital Corp, acquired 75 single-aisle 737s for an unnamed buyer, indicating Boeing had to help arrange financing to close the deal.
Such deals do not typically stay on Boeing's balance sheet but would be sold on to other lessors. Boeing declined to name the underlying customer involved. 
Boeing has said it aims to ship between 810 and 815 commercial aircraft in 2018, as much as 6.8 percent more than the industry record 763 jets it delivered in 2017, putting it ahead of Airbus for the sixth year in a row. Airbus forecasts delivering around 800 planes in general for 2018.
Airbus scored a key victory on Tuesday, with U.S. airline JetBlue (O:JBLU) announcing it would buy 60 of its A220-300 narrowbody jets, the first major order for the planemaker's newly rebranded program as its battle with rival  Boeing Co  intensifies.
Boeing said first-half deliveries rose 7.4 percent to 378 aircraft, led by higher demand for its single-aisle 737 jetliners. Deliveries have been fueled by strong demand from airlines that are enjoying booming passenger travel.
Airbus delivered 303 aircraft in the first half, down about 1 percent from a year earlier.
Boeing shares rose 1.5 percent to $347.16. 
The Farnborough Airshow, held every other year in alternation with Paris, kicks off July 16 outside London. Global planemakers could reap 900 orders and commitments from the show, down just slightly from last year's event, as strong oil prices prompt airlines to top up orders for fuel-efficient narrowbody models, aviation consultancy IBA Group said.

On average, the summer jamborees account for 30 percent of annual commercial business, according to IBA.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>",Ex-biopharmaceutical employees convicted in U.S. of insider trading,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two former employees of rival biopharmaceutical companies were convicted on Tuesday on U.S. charges that they used their access to confidential information about drug studies to profit in the stock market through insider trading.
A federal jury in Boston found Schultz Chan, a former Akebia Therapeutics Inc employee, and Songjiang Wang, who worked at Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc, guilty on conspiracy and securities fraud charges.
Jurors delivered the verdict after less than an hour of deliberations following a two-week trial. Both men are scheduled to be sentenced in early October.
Lawyers for Chan and Wang declined to comment following the verdict. The men have denied wrongdoing, and their attorneys contended they did not rely on inside information to place trades in the stock of each other's companies.
Prosecutors said that from 2013 to 2014, Wang, Merrimack's director of statistical programing, tipped his friend Chan, 54, three times about positive results in drug studies before the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company announced them.
The tips allowed Chan and his wife to buy Merrimack stock before the studies' results were announced, prosecutors said. They said on one tip alone, Chan and his wife made $136,000 trading before the results of a cancer drug study were revealed.
Prosecutors said Wang, 54, also provided Chan money, which he used to buy Merrimack stock on Wang's behalf. Chan later in March 2015 wrote Wang a check for $84,000, which prosecutors said represented Wang's profits. 
Prosecutors said that soon after Chan in August 2015 started a job as director of biostatistics at Akebia, he began buying the Cambridge-based company's stock after learning details about a study for a drug it was developing.
Chan also tipped Wang, who likewise began buying Akebia stock and risky call options before the company announced the results of the study, which involved a drug to treat anemia patients who also had chronic kidney disease, prosecutors said.
At trial, Chan testified that he had placed trades in both companies' stocks based on his own analysis of public information they had released, rather than anything he learned while working at Akebia or talking to Wang.
""He did not tell me anything,"" he said.

Chan also said he wrote the $84,000 check to repay Wang for loans he provided Chan to cover the costs of hiring contractors to repair two properties. But under questioning by a prosecutor, Chan could not name the contractors he said he hired.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. judge allows lawsuits over Monsanto's Roundup to proceed to trial,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Hundreds of lawsuits against  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co by cancer survivors or families of those who died can proceed to trial, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday, finding there was sufficient evidence for a jury to hear the cases that blame the company's glyphosate-containing weed-killer for the disease.
The decision by U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco followed years of litigation and weeks of hearings about the controversial science surrounding the safety of the chemical glyphosate, the key ingredient in Monsanto's top-selling weed-killer. 
Monsanto is now a unit of  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), following a $62.5 billion takeover of the U.S. seed major which closed in June.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last September concluded glyphosate is likely not carcinogenic to humans. But the World Health Organization in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" 
Chhabria called the plaintiffs' expert opinions ""shaky"" and entirely excluded the opinions of two scientists. But he said a reasonable jury could conclude, based on the findings of four experts he allowed, that glyphosate can cause cancer in humans.
The plaintiffs will next have to prove Roundup caused cancer in specific people whose cases will be selected for test trials, a phase Chhabria in his Tuesday opinion called a ""daunting challenge.""
Lawsuits by more than 400 farmers, landscapers and consumers who claim Roundup caused them to develop non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a type of blood cell cancer, have been consolidated before Chhabria.
Monsanto denies the allegations and in a statement said it would continue to defend the lawsuits with evidence proving there is ""absolutely no connection between glyphosate and cancer."" The company said its position was supported by more than 800 scientific studies and reviews.
The company had told Chhabria in March that none of the plaintiffs' experts satisfied scientific or legal requirements for admissibility and urged the judge to dismiss the cases.
Aimee Wagstaff, one of the lawyers representing the people suing the company, in a statement said she was pleased her clients will have their day in court. ""It's time to hold Monsanto accountable for putting this dangerous product on the market,"" Wagstaff said.
Monsanto faces 5,000 lawsuits nationwide alleging Roundup caused cancer, mainly in state courts.

While Chhabria's ruling is not binding on them, state court judges have been closely following the federal litigation and expert hearings. The California state judge who handles the most Roundup cases posted to her docket that she was attending the hearings before Chhabria in March.

1. Inflation Data, Earnings in the Spotlight
Economic indicators are likely to set the market tone for the open Wednesday. Wholesale inflation figures should get the most attention.
The headline producer price index (PPI) and the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, are expected to show a smaller increase in inflation for June compared with May’s figures.
Economists expect both to have risen by 0.2%.
The latest data on wholesale inventories also arrives before the bell.
Looking to earnings, wholesale industrial and construction supplier Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow. Shares took a hit when the stock was downgraded to neutral from buy by Baird last Tuesday, but have since rallied as earnings approached.
2. Inventories and OPEC Should Call Oil Direction
Among stocks, energy shares will likely be active as investors get the latest oil inventory figures from the Energy Information Administration.
A drawdown in crude oil and gasoline inventories is expected for the week ended July 6. Distillate stockpiles are expected to have risen for the week.
OPEC’s monthly report will also give investors and traders a look at how the cartel is dealing with demands for more supply to keep a lid on prices.
Crude Oil WTI Futures settled up 26 cents to $74.11 on Tuesday.
3. Tough Trade Talk to Continue With Trump in Europe?
The prospect of further trade battles will continue to have an impact on the markets, especially as U.S. President Donald Trump travels to Europe.
Trump’s first meeting will be with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday. Along with his calls for European nations to pay more for NATO defense, he may take the opportunity to decry what he sees as unfair trade practices by the European Union.
The president tweeted on Tuesday that the U.S. loses $151 billion on trade with the EU and that the single bloc charges the U.S. big tariffs and enacts trade barriers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Airbus SE scored a key victory on Tuesday, with U.S. airline JetBlue (O:JBLU) announcing it would buy 60 of its A220-300 narrowbody jets, the first major order for the planemaker's newly rebranded program as its battle with rival  Boeing Co  intensifies.
Earlier on Tuesday, Airbus (PA:AIR) unveiled the new A220 name for the 110-seat to 130-seat model jets, previously called the CSeries under Canadian firm Bombardier (TO:BBDb), at a ceremony at the planemaker's Toulouse facilities in France.
Airbus has taken majority control of the loss-making Montreal-based aircraft program, with Bombardier and Quebec as minority partners. The deal closed on July 1.
""We feel the 220 is the perfect fit for our network, strategy and customer experience, and most importantly, for our owners,"" JetBlue Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest said in a phone interview. ""It really is the ideal aircraft to carry the momentum of our structured cost program well into the next decade."" 
The A220 will replace JetBlue's existing fleet of 60 Embraer E190 aircraft, with those jets retiring beginning in 2020. 
The A220's triumph over Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) sets the stage for a fierce competition between Airbus and Chicago-based Boeing Co (N:BA) in the narrowbody market. Both major planemakers have recently taken stakes in smaller rivals' jet programs. 
Boeing last week announced a tentative deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Embraer under a new $4.75 billion joint venture.
""It's a very smart decision on JetBlue's part because the A220 is an extremely flexible airplane,"" Atmosphere Research Group fleet analyst Henry Harteveldt said, adding that it was a ""completely new airplane"" with a fuel efficiency that would allow JetBlue to carry ""20 to 30 more passengers for free.""
The jets will be powered by Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) PW1500G engines. Pratt & Whitney is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).
JetBlue declined to outline the financial details of the deal. 
The carrier said the new aircraft will be assembled at Airbus' Mobile, Alabama, facility.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Two managing directors overseeing alternative investments at Wilshire Funds Management quit the firm in June, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as employees appeared increasingly disgruntled about its lack of commitment to the sector.
A Wilshire spokeswoman confirmed the departures of Monique Miller and Jonathan Miles. Miles led the alternatives research and advisory business at Wilshire's consulting unit, while Miller headed alternative business development strategy. Miles recently took a position with Ascent Private Capital Management, according his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
The executives left less than two months after Managing Director Nicolas Amato, who headed alternative investment activities, left in early May.
Alice Zeng, an associate who worked directly for Amato left in recent weeks, the source said.
The alternative investment group at Wilshire, one of the industry's best known investment and consulting firms, helps clients like pension funds construct portfolios that include hedge funds. Demand for such services has rebounded recently as investors want steady returns with less risk.
But two former Wilshire employees say the firm has not made a committed effort to build up the business. Wilshire declined to comment.
Andrew Jarrous, who also reported to Amato and who had been a vice president for hedge fund manager research with expertise in global macro and relative value strategies, left Wilshire around the same time that Amato resigned.
Amato's group had three other staffers. Miles' group also had three other employees, who remain at the company, the source said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged the former chief executive of Heartland Payment Systems Inc with insider trading for tipping his longtime romantic partner about the payment processor's $4.3 billion takeover by  Global Payments  Inc (N:GPN).
Robert Carr, 73, who also founded Heartland, was accused of repeatedly discussing the late-2015 merger talks with Katherine Hanratty, 65, whose relationship with him had begun in 2011.
Carr was also accused of having given Hanratty a $1 million check before the merger, with instructions to open a brokerage account and buy $900,000 of Heartland stock.
The SEC said Hanratty, whom it also charged, did what Carr asked, and sold her stock for a $250,628 profit in April 2016, four months after Atlanta-based Global Payments agreed to buy its smaller rival.
Hanratty, who co-owns a staffing agency, had repeatedly expressed concern to Carr about her finances, and after opening the brokerage account - which named Carr as the beneficiary - emailed him that ""for the first time ever I feel a sense of relief knowing that I have some security,"" the SEC said.
Global Payments agreed on Dec. 15, 2015 to buy Princeton, New Jersey-based Heartland for $100 per share, a 17.5 percent premium, and more than 28 percent above where it traded on Dec. 9 before media began reporting a possible merger.
The SEC said Carr, of New London, New Hampshire, had bragged to his children and their spouses that a merger was in the works, and given Hanratty, of Watertown, Connecticut, a draft quotation for the press release announcing it.
""Love it,"" replied Hanratty, even as she suggested an improvement, the SEC said.
The SEC complaint filed with the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, seeks civil fines, the recouping of illegal profit, and an officer and director ban for Carr.
Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A lawyer for Global Payments declined to comment. The company in May sued Carr and Hanratty in the federal court in Trenton, New Jersey to recoup trading profits it said arose from Carr's alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.

The SEC case is SEC v Carr et al, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 18-01135.

PARIS (Reuters) - Grabbing a bicycle from a docking station and riding the streets of Paris used to be one of the city's many charms, but the once-loved Velib system has fallen into disarray and some new dockless bike-share schemes are struggling to survive.
After it launched in 2007, Velib quickly became a hit, signing up more than 250,000 users who could took advantage of 20,000 bikes around the city. But advertising company JCDecaux's concession to run Velib expired last year.
A French-Spanish consortium called Smovengo won the tender to run the service for the next 15 years, but it struggled to meet a January deadline to install new docking stations and has battled a raft of technology problems, leaving users frustrated.
At the same time, four dockless bike-share schemes, all run by Asian operators, have popped across the city, offering users the ability to unlock a freestanding bike via an App for a fee.
While initially popular thanks to their novelty and Velib's problems, some of those schemes are now running into trouble, with users unhappy with the quality of the bikes, many of which have been vandalized or thrown in the Seine.
Singapore's oBike this week became the second of the schemes to give up on Paris, which wants to be an urban leader in green mobility. OBike officials did not return calls but a former official said key staff in France had left the company. 
In February, Hong Kong startup Gobee.bike halted its operations due to theft and vandalism. 
China-owned bike-share firms Ofo and Mobike remain active and have been steadily growing their numbers thanks in part to Smovengo's struggle to get fully up and running.
Laurent Kennel, general manager at Ofo France, said the firm now had about 2,500 of its bright yellow bikes on Paris roads and aimed to grow that to 3,000 to 4,000 by the end of summer. 
""In Paris and elsewhere, there have been low-quality bikes that were not made to last,"" he said. ""Free-floating bike sharing hasn't created the chaos that some had predicted a few months ago, it's going quite well.""
Mobike also has several thousand of its red bikes on Paris streets and has been adding a larger version, more suited to European frames, also with three speeds, like Ofo and Velib. 
Paris cyclists have welcome the new schemes, but are nostalgic for the old Velibs, which they say offered a better, smoother ride and were cheaper thanks to state subsidies. 
""Bike share services are good for short distances, you can drop them wherever you want, which is convenient,"" said Paris cyclist David Bober. ""But their quality is not great and they are not very comfortable for long distances.""
He said he used to pay about 30 euros a year for his Velib subscription but that membership for two Asian dockless schemes costs him around 20 euros a month. 
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has recognized that the city needs to get a grip on the schemes and make sure Velib works.
""We know there is this entire field, this entire space of mobility which exists and can be managed in a different way. But for us it clear that it must be regulated,"" she said.
Still, more start ups are using Paris as a test-center. Last month, California-based Lime launched a fleet of dock-free electric scooters in the city, part of a wider roll-out in several European cities.
Danish bike share operator Donkey Republic has also launched several hundred dockless bikes. Unlike Mobike and Ofo, the large Danish bikes cannot be parked anywhere but must be chained up at designated parking spots.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has promoted Ted Pick to head of its trading and investment banking businesses, the most recent elevation for an executive who has overseen several key initiatives at the Wall Street bank.
The move, part of a broader executive shuffle that also moved Franck Petitgas from co-head of investment banking to head of Morgan Stanley's international business, was disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Pick, 49, started his career at Morgan Stanley in investment banking and later moved to trading. He ran the bank's equities trading business, which became a key money-maker as it struggled in other businesses, and then helped orchestrate a difficult overhaul of its fixed income operation, which had weighed on results for years. (http://reut.rs/2oKRVTo)
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and President Colm Kelleher, 61, who previously led the institutional securities business, called the promotion ""a natural next step"" for Pick in the memo. Pick's shift to a role that Kelleher has long overseen is important because it hints at succession planning at Morgan Stanley.
While there is no indication Gorman has plans to retire soon, and though Kelleher is his deputy, the process to find a next long-term CEO can take years to cement. Petitgas has also been mentioned as a potential successor among analysts, former executives and others who closely follow Morgan Stanley.
In addition to Pick's elevation, Susie Huang will become co-head of investment banking alongside Mark Eichorn, according to the memo. Petitgas previously had that role.
Pick and Petitgas will report to Kelleher, while Huang and Eichorn will report to Pick.

In a separate memo, Pick appointed Gokul Laroia, David Russell and Alan Thomas as global co-heads of Institutional Equities.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities are considering transferring a stake owned by state-controlled Otkritie bank in the country's second largest lender, VTB (MM:VTBR), to state development bank VEB, three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. 
The deal, if it went ahead, would fit in with a broader move in Russia's banking sector and economy, where once privately-held assets are being transferred to state entities that are taking on a more powerful role in the economy. 
The 15 percent stake which could be transferred is worth around $1.5 billion at current market prices. Otkritie bank is a former private lender which was bailed out by the central bank last year. The Russian government holds a further 61 percent stake in VTB. The rest of the shares are traded on the market. 
VEB, headed by former first deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov since May, is set to be recapitalized to serve as one of the key vehicles for President Vladimir Putin's new investment drive after his re-election this year. 
VEB also needs the fresh capital after running into problems with past investments dating back to the Sochi 2014 Olympics.
In May, Putin ordered at least 8 trillion roubles worth($128.4 billion) of state spending on infrastructure, education and healthcare over the next six years. 
To find at least some of that money, the government has proposed to increase value-added-tax, the retirement age and raise more debt. 
VEB's Shuvalov said in May the size of the future capital injection would have to be decided by the finance ministry. 
A source familiar with the matter said one of the options being considered to bolster VEB's finances was a transfer to the bank of Otkritie's 15 percent stake in VTB, which Otkritie got when it was still a private commercial lender. 
This was confirmed by two other sources - a state banker and a high-ranked official. 
The central bank, which owns Otkritie, and VEB did not reply to Reuters' requests for comment. Otkritie bank said it was not currently discussing such an idea. The finance ministry declined to comment. 
The sources said no final decision had been taken. 
Anton Lopatin, an analyst with Fitch ratings agency in Moscow, said assets such as real estate or equity stakes could be used to boost a bank's capital. 
""There have already been such examples in Russia in the past,"" Lopatin said. 
""But there is a risk that the value of the assets can go down, so the capital injection can end up being lower than planned. The conventional way to boost a firm's capital - issuing new shares - is more solid in our view.""

231,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 12:06PM ET</span>",Air France-KLM CEO hunt signals industry strategy shift under Macron,"By Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - The hunt for a new chief executive to lead Air France-KLM, a group hobbled by union resistance to cost-cutting at its French brand, is testing President Emmanuel Macron's resolve for a lighter state touch on the economy.
Macron's government has told the Franco-Dutch airline group its very survival is at stake if it fails to become more competitive and undergo the painful reforms completed by carriers such as British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) as they battle low-cost airlines and Gulf carriers.
In what would signal a subtle shift in French industrial strategy, two sources familiar with Macron's thinking said the government is open to considering a non-French national as chairman of the group for the first time. 
This chairman would sit above one chief executive for Air France, who would almost certainly be a French national, and one for KLM, one of the sources said. 
It is just one option on the table. Macron's office expects to receive a shortlist of candidates from the group's interim management by the end of next week, a third source familiar with the matter said. 
The Air France-KLM group (PA:AIRF) has been led by French chief executives since its formation in 2004, a demand of the French state, its largest shareholder and one with heavy influence over the group's board thanks to its outsized voting rights.
The last, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned in May after losing a fight over pay with Air France staff. His role as group chief executive and chairman as well as chairman of the Air France unit has prompted a rethink of the structure. 
Paris' readiness to consider a foreigner to oversee a revamp of the airline's strategy and negotiations with Air France unions reflects Macron's desire to create pan-European companies that can withstand globalization, even if that means placing control of a national asset in foreign hands. 
""What we want to do is to create European champions,"" a finance ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's not of primary importance that the boss has to be French.""
""It wouldn't worry us if we ended up with an aviation specialist from Europe.""
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115), which both hold 8.8 percent stakes in Air France-KLM, declined to comment.
Two names have leaked to media in past weeks. Philippe Capron, the financial head of Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), pulled out after French ministers said they wanted an aviation specialist and that he was one of several candidates.
Le Figaro reported on Monday that Catherine Guillouard, chief executive of French public transport group RATP, was being considered for the top job at Air France-KLM. Two sources told Reuters she was not an official candidate.
INVESTOR PRESSURE
The job of Air France-KLM chief executive may not be one that widely appeals. 
The next company chief will face the unenviable task of having to break union resistance to reduce Air France's swollen cost base, while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch KLM staff onside. A wave of strikes this spring at Air France over pay cost the group some 350 million euros ($410.97 million) and led to the ouster of Janaillac. 
Sources say KLM officials are frustrated at French staff's chronic labor conflicts and blame Air France's weak handling of the powerful SNPL pilots' union for the group's fragile state.
Investors are frustrated too. The group's share price has slumped 47 percent so far this year. 
Asked recently if the group could have a Dutch chief executive, KLM CEO Pieter Elbers responded: ""why not?""
The pressure from investors to slash costs has intensified as rising fuel costs and overcapacity squeeze margins. 
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned after Janaillac quit that he would not soak up the airline's losses. 
Overseeing a restructuring of Air France-KLM would cement Macron's reputation as a reformist and modernizer.
""Restructuring ... is what is required to move Air France-KLM forward. Anything else will be history repeating itself,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska.
STATE EXIT?
Macron could go further and sell-down France's 14.3 percent stake in Air France-KLM, a move that would deliver a potent message that he is serious about liberalizing the economy.
The state's exit from the airline group would hand its leadership more freedom to stare down the unions.
""(IAG chief executive) Willie Walsh just stared them down until blood came out of their eyes and they gave up,"" said aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. 
AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) announced last month it was looking at buying all or part of the French state's stake - an option the government has not closed the door on but which faces obstacles.
""The government is studying things and is closed to nothing, but the first priority is to find a new leadership team for Air France-KLM,"" the finance ministry official said.
AccorHotels' overseas investors could, however, complicate any deal. Its main investors are from China and the Gulf, whose own airlines compete with Air France-KLM on long-haul routes. 
European Union rules also require more than half of a European airline's capital to be held by member states or EU nationals. 
""Accor's capital today is not sufficiently European for it to work,"" said a second source familiar with the discussions. There would, however, be ways to overcome this, analysts say. 
The state's holding remains an open question. Nonetheless, analysts are encouraged by broader comments on the future of Air France-KLM coming out of the French finance ministry. 
""The noises heard out of the finance ministry definitely signify a change in attitude toward Air France-KLM from the French state, said Roeska. "" And they fit with Macron’s wider strategy.""

(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc's (O:PEP) better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday pointed to signs of a gradual recovery in its struggling soda business as the company doubled down on efforts to promote colas, setting shares up for their best day in seven years.
The company's North America beverages sales fell 0.9 percent - its smallest drop in four quarters - as the company went ""toe-to-toe"" with rival Coca-Cola in marketing and pricing and launched a campaign to revive soda sales.
Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi has been trying to popularize the company's trademark colas amid intense competition from  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) and as consumers opt for healthier drinks.
Demand for its zero sugar Pepsi and diet Pepsi were ""flying off the shelves,"" Nooyi said in a post earnings call with analysts. 
""Every part of our business in North American Beverages is showing sequential improvement,"" Nooyi said. ""As we go into the third quarter, we feel good about the trend rate.""
PepsiCo's net revenue rose 2.4 percent to $16.09 billion, of which $5.19 billion came from its beverage business and beat Wall Street expectations.
""There were some concerns the sales were going to be lackluster and instead we saw some solid improvements,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. 
""(PepsiCo) did seem like that they are starting to see some sort of inflection point in the (beverages) results."" 
Sales at Frito-Lay North America, its biggest business, grew for the second straight quarter, rising 4.3 percent on the back of higher sales of its newly launched products Doritos Blaze and Ruffles Mozzarella and Marinara. 
The company has been ramping up its snacks offering to overcome its sluggish beverage sales by introducing products with new flavors, healthier preparation methods and attractive packaging.
Pepsi's overseas markets also grew with organic revenue rising 7 percent in Europe Sub-Saharan Africa and 6 percent in Asia, Middle East & North Africa. 
Net income attributable to the company fell about 14 percent to $1.82 billion, in the second quarter ended June 16, mainly due to higher costs for transportation and raw materials. 
To offset these impacts, Pepsi cut costs across the board and refranchised its Thailand beverage operations. 
Excluding items, Pepsi earned $1.61 per share, topping analysts' estimate of $1.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Pepsi also played down the impact of tariffs imposed by the United States on aluminum imports, saying it so far was ""immaterial"". 

Shares of the company were up 3.7 percent at $111.78 in morning trading.

The strike will take place at the San Fernando warehouse on the outskirts of Madrid, Amazon's biggest in Spain, on July 16, 17 and 18, to coincide with a 1-1/2 day sale on the platform.
Douglas Harper, a representative of the Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) union told Reuters the union primarily objected to wage cuts, working conditions and restrictions on time off.
It will be the second walk-out this year at the San Fernando warehouse where most of Amazon's 1,600-strong Spanish workforce is based.
""Strikes aren't good for anyone, not the company, the workers or the customers, but we need to keep putting pressure on local management,"" Harper said.
Amazon said earlier this month it would hire a further 1,600 people on permanent contracts in Spain this year.

Responding to the call to strike, the company said in a statement: ""Amazon's total pay is at the high end of the range in the logistics sector, it includes an attractive salary and an extensive benefits package.""

Investors are having flashbacks to 2015-16 amid fears over China’s industrial complex while the nation gets dragged into a trade war. But markets are unlikely to be revisited by the deflationary monster of years past.
From a solid U.S. manufacturing trajectory to a resilient credit cycle, here’s why.
Oil’s Well That Ends Well
For one, crude prices are on a tear compared to three years ago, juicing commodity-linked assets and sending benign signals about the global growth cycle.
In 2015, producers reticent to address a supply glut kept crude depressed. Today, the shoe is on the other foot, with stockpile drawdowns and rising prices despite ever-increasing domestic production.
Firm oil prices are here to stay, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., which projects the market will remain in structural deficit for most of the next six quarters.
In turn, oil’s rise is buoying junk bonds, an asset class dubbed the canary in the coal mine for the U.S. business cycle. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF is in the green this year -- in 2015, it gave back 5 percent.
The “chances of a credit cycle playing out are lower today than immediately after the meltdown in energy/commodities/EM and going into Brexit uncertainty in the middle of 2016,” BofA strategists wrote in a note.
And the resilience in high-yield credit is broad-based: premiums have tightened across a slew of sectors so far this year, in contrast to spiking spreads in 2015.
While global growth may have come off the boil, manufacturing sectors around the world -- particularly the U.S. -- are on a much firmer footing. Monthly purchasing managers’ indexes point to a solid expansion in factory activity, while in early 2016, the global gauge bottomed at 50, implying stagnation.
Meanwhile, the bar for China to export disinflation via currency depreciation has also been raised, according to Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research.
“In the second half of 2015, core PCE inflation ran just 1.3 percent annualized,” he said. “It is north of 2 percent on a six month basis now, which implies there is some room to deal with the deflationary consequences of a strengthening in the U.S. dollar.”
And investors are sanguine.
The low cost of options that pay out should the Consumer Price Index average an annual rise of less than zero over the next two years shows just how different the domestic backdrop is compared to 2015.
Stemming the Outflows
The Made in China risk shouldn’t be overstated, either.
In early 2016, fears over the country’s financial stability took center stage amid accelerating outflows and rampant expectations for continued currency depreciation while corporates scrambled to cover mismatches between their assets and liabilities. That same dynamic has yet to rear its head.
“The real capital outflows are manageable as the RMB depreciation expectation remains largely stable,” said Macquarie strategist Teresa Lam in a note. “This should ease the market‘s worry that the weakness of RMB was triggered by significant portfolio outflows.”
In addition, investors have reason to downplay tentative signs of a cooling in Chinese growth, chalking it up to seasonal factors and delays on big-ticket purchases ahead of cuts to levies on imported vehicles.
The six-month moving average of Bloomberg’s estimate for annual expansion sits at 7 percent in May -- a half a percentage point better than it was ahead of the August 2015 shock devaluation of the yuan.
For a true repeat of 2015, the carnage in Chinese and emerging market equities will need to intensify.
Back then, the Shanghai Composite ultimately fell 50 percent from peak to intermediate trough. Roughly five and a half months removed from its recent high, the index is down 21 percent. Likewise, the MSCI Emerging Market Index has suffered a less-punitive drawdown.
America First
The U.S. equity resilience is even more striking.
The S&P 500 Index is just 3 percent away from its all-time high, and up 4.5 percent since the dollar began to rise against the yuan in mid-April. In August 2015, the benchmark U.S. stock gauge abruptly fell 10 percent as markets reacted to China’s currency surprise.
The earnings trend is helping to fortify investors’ resolve that American companies are better able to withstand exogenous shocks compared with three years ago.
Still, in case you need reminding: one potentially massive risk absent in 2015 threatens to shake the firmament of global markets.

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus gave its newly acquired Canadian CSeries jet a new name and looked close to winning an inaugural order on Tuesday as it prepares to broaden its battle with Boeing (NYSE:BA) for jet sales.
The European firm said it was rebranding the plane as the A220, slotting it just under its longstanding A300 portfolio which stretches from the 124-seat A319 to the 544-seat A380.
Airbus expects to sell a ""double-digit"" number of the jets that have 110-130 seats this year and sees demand for at least 3,000 of them over 20 years, said CSeries sales chief David Dufrenois. 
""I don't think it will be very long before we see the first results on the market,"" said Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz. 
The CSeries has been locked in a fierce competition for a deal to supply jets to U.S. carrier JetBlue (O:JBLU) and is in poll position to win as Airbus also offers more attractive delivery positions on its larger planes, industry sources said.
Airbus and JetBlue declined comment.
The rebranding seals the takeover of one of Canada's most visible industrial projects and ends Bombardier's efforts to go it alone in the mainline jet market against larger rivals.
Airbus officials stressed it would be positive for jobs in Quebec where the lightweight jet is built.
The 110-seat and 130-seat models, previously known as CS100 and CS300, will be known as A220-100 and A220-300 respectively.
A deal for Airbus to take majority control of the loss-making Montreal-based aircraft program with Bombardier and Quebec as minority partners closed on July 1.
The move also sets the stage for a broader confrontation with Boeing, which last week announced a tentative deal to take over the commercial unit of Bombardier's competitor Embraer.
Until now the two plane giants have focused mainly on planes starting at 150 seats and largely ignored the niche below their single-aisle jets.
Adding the smaller models to their portfolios will broaden the revenue base of each company and prevent a key slice of Western know-how reaching potential competitor China, which had held talks to buy the CSeries, people involved in the deal said.
The change of identity came in a slick branding ceremony as the Canadian-developed passenger jet performed a flypast in searing heat over Airbus's Toulouse facilities, with executives papering over past differences over prospects for the jet. 

Airbus said it expected total demand for 7,000 planes in its category over 20 years, including its own A319.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners has raised $1.8 billion to invest in startups from cryptocurrency to beauty supplies, hoping to build on its streak of lucrative bets in companies such as  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), the firm's partners told Reuters.
Lightspeed has historically been an early-stage investment firm and was the first outside investor in Snap's messaging app Snapchat. But about $1.05 billion of the new funding will be earmarked for a separate fund to invest in more mature companies, the partners said on Monday. The dollar amount is more than double the size of its previous growth-stage fund.
Lightspeed is eyeing a business expansion to Southeast Asia and wants to add investments in cryptocurrency, biotechnology, new TV streaming services and even cosmetics companies.
As startups stay private for longer, relying on venture capital rather than the public markets for funding, firms like Lightspeed have to invest repeatedly in a company for years if they want to maintain a large enough ownership stake.
""That trend has only been increasing over time, and as a result our funds have been getting bigger over time as well,"" said Jeremy Liew, a Lightspeed partner. Later-stage companies are less likely to go belly up, but are also less likely to provide extraordinary returns, he said.
Lightspeed also said it hired a new partner, Brad Twohig, formerly an investor with Insight Venture Partners, who will help lead the firm's growth investments. 
The firm's larger fund for growth-stage investing reflects a shift in the venture capital industry that has been underway for years, as deep-pocketed investors from every corner of the globe have piled into startup investing. 
SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Vision Fund, a more than $93 billion investment vehicle, has rankled the venture capital community by investing billions of dollars into companies such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. The fund often commands a large ownership stake and may buy out existing investors.
An investment of ""$500 million or a billion dollars can be a king-making strategy,"" said Lightspeed partner Ravi Mhatre. ""But it's not a substitute for building a lasting company.""
In the first half of the year, U.S. venture capitalists have raised more than $20 billion across 157 funds, on pace to beat last year's total, according to a report released Tuesday by data firm PitchBook Inc. By comparison, venture firms raised $18 billion across 157 funds for all of 2004, the oldest available Pitchbook data. 
The median-size venture fund is about 20 percent bigger than in 2004.
Lightspeed will be challenged to live up to the performance of its previous funds, which returned $2.7 billion to investors since the start of 2017, the firm said. As venture-backed tech companies have delayed their initial public offerings, many venture capital firms have seen investment gains mostly on paper. Lightspeed has been an exception.
Lightspeed-backed companies have held 17 initial public offerings in the last five years, about half of which have occurred since the start of 2017, including messaging app Snap, personal stylist company  Stitch Fix  Inc (O:SFIX) and data storage provider  Nutanix Inc  (O:NTNX). Lightspeed also reaped windfalls when Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) acquired AppDynamics Inc and when Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM) bought MuleSoft for multiple billions of dollars.
""If you point to one moment in time for the firm it was probably the Snap IPO,"" said Liew, who led the firm's Snap investment. ""But really, it's a decade of hard work and it all came to fruition at the same time."" 
Also on Tuesday, Silicon Valley firm Scale Venture Partners announced a new $400 million fund, smaller than some of its peers but still about 20 percent larger than its previous fund. Partner Alex Niehenke said he was skeptical of the ""massive, massive funds"" other firms were raising.

""They start writing much bigger checks, and talking entrepreneurs into taking more money than they need,"" he said.

266,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>",MACQUARIE: A key indicator used by Wall Street to predict recessions has been calling things wrong for decades," When a recession is approaching, one of the first signs that things are starting to go downhill will be a substantial and sustained fall in the stock market. Or so the received wisdom goes.
New research from Australian investment bank, Macquarie, however, found that while its true to say stock markets tend to witness big falls around and during recessions, there's no real pattern to how they do it — and that, generally speaking, markets fall more during recessions than they do before the start.
Here's Macquarie's chart:
""As one would expect, we find that equity prices have historically declined significantly around recessions (as defined by the NBER). However, we find no clear pattern as to the behaviour of equity prices in the lead-up to recessions,"" Macquarie's team of Ric Deverell, Hayden Skilling, and David Doyle wrote to clients.
""We also show that, while the equity market typically declines somewhat from its peak around a recession, most of the decline occurs after the recession has begun,"" the continued.
Not only do equities not follow a pattern of decline before recessions, but they have also completely mispredicted recessions several times in recent decades. Macquarie points to several clear examples of major stock market falls from a peak — a widely watched recession indicator — where no recession has actually followed.
""Using a sharp decline in equity prices as an indicator of a forthcoming recession has produced several false signals, with equity market bear markets (declines of 20% or more) occurring in 1962, 1966 and 1987, for example, with no recession following,"" Deverell and his team said.
Furthermore, Deverell and team argued, there is very little rhyme or reason to the timing peak of a stock market before a recession.
""In the 11 post-war recessions, the equity market has peaked (limited to the previous three years) between 1 month and 29 months before the recession, with a median lead of 9 months,"" they wrote.
""However, this does not account for the numerous false signals exhibited by equity market peaks taking place between recessions.""
Here's the chart:
Macquarie's conclusion is that while there are some links between falling stock markets and recessions, they are simply too inconsistent to reveal any particular patterns, and therefore, that using a dropping stock market as a recession indicator is ill-advised at best.
""While equity prices are likely to fall once a recession arrives, there is little historical evidence to suggest that equity markets lead recessions.""
Numerous banks and financial institutions are making early moves to protect themselves from what they see as an imminent downturn — partially because the stock market appears to near its peak — with  Citi bank in particular warning last week that a ""full-on bear market"" and possibly a recession is just round the corner.
Macquarie, thanks to its research, is a lot more optimistic, with Deverell and team saying they ""expect US growth to remain robust this year and next, adding that ""those looking to pre-position for recession may be moving too early."""

268,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","MORGAN STANLEY: The stock market is taking a major turn for the worse, and it's bad news for tech stocks","The stock market is at a turning point, according to Morgan Stanley.
For many months, the bank's equity strategists have written to clients about a forthcoming rotation toward defensive sectors, which investors prefer during downturns. They warned about a long, drawn-out  bear market in valuations marked by slower profit growth. They  recommended utilities as the best defensive sector as the broader stock market risked losses.
In a note Monday, the firm's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, said the market's turning point arrived in June. Since June 18, defensive sectors like utilities and real estate have outperformed cyclical sectors like tech and financials.
Wilson also identified that two out of three conditions for a rotation to defensive sectors were happening and that investors were discounting them: peaking S&P 500 earnings growth on a year-on-year basis and a top in the 10-year Treasury yield. The third would occur if the 10-year yield were to fall below the two-year — a so-called yield-curve inversion.
They took their defensive call into a higher gear by downgrading small-caps to equal weight, and tech stocks to underweight, in a client note on Monday. They also upgraded consumer staples and telecom stocks to equal weight.
""We think it makes sense to lower broad [tech] exposure in the near term, or, at the very least, hedge sector exposure aggressively into earnings season as elevated valuations, lack of material earnings upside, extended positioning, technicals, and trade related risks all add up to a poor risk reward for the sector in the near term,"" Wilson said in a note on Monday.
Analysts project 25%  earnings growth for tech companies, which will report second-quarter results shortly. Wilson, however, said there's not much room to meaningfully beat expectations.
This ""remarkable"" earnings forecast is already reflected in stock prices, Wilson said. Similarly, the fundamentals that would drive the earnings growth are already priced in. While not in ""bubble"" territory, he added, the price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 tech companies is over two standard deviations above the postcrisis average.
Tech companies, particularly hardware providers that source parts from all over the world, have benefitted from global trade but are in the crosshairs of a trade war. Wilson expects managements to address trade during earnings calls, which could dampen their guidance and earnings growth.
On a technical note, Wilson observed that fewer stocks were trading below their 200-day moving averages.
""Given its exceptional growth and quality characteristics, tech has been a holdout to date,"" Wilson said.
""However, we suspect it will not be immune from the changing attitudes toward risk assets we are seeing across markets and think the sector may have benefitted from a false sense of security the past few months."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlueMountain Capital Management on Tuesday said it hired four portfolio managers to build out the hedge fund's new fixed-income strategy focused on relative-value investments in G7 government bonds, U.S. municipal bonds, agency ABS and emerging market debt.
Morgan Alcalay, Evan Boulukos, Phil Hermann and Andrew Seiz have joined the $22 billion New York-based firm and will report to Colin Teichholtz, head of global governments and agency mortgages.
Andrew Feldstein, co-founder and chief investment officer of BlueMountain, said investor and regulatory constraints, market fragmentation, large flows and issuance and increased volatility are creating opportunities for relative-value investing.
""With the reduction in Wall Street’s balance sheets and proprietary trading since the financial crisis, we see an opportunity for BlueMountain to become a new liquidity provider to the market,"" he said.
Stephen Siderow, co-founder and co-president at BlueMountain, added that they are taking advantage of what the firm believes will be greater market dislocation and volatility.
""I think an end to global central banks' unified, unison monetary policies -- the U.S., Asia, Europe and emerging markets -- creates potential relative value,"" Siderow said.
Alcalay joins as portfolio manager of interest rates and will focus on relative-value investment opportunities in developed nation government debt. Before joining BlueMountain, he traded U.S. Treasuries at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and traded and STRIPS at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.
Boulukos joins as portfolio manager of municipal bonds. Prior to joining BlueMountain, he was a managing director in the municipal securities division at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), where he managed a proprietary municipal bond portfolio. Before Citigroup, he was an institutional municipal flow trader at Lehman Brothers.
Hermann joins as portfolio manager of agency MBS. Previously, he traded agency MBS at Pine River Capital.
Seiz joins as portfolio manager for emerging market debt, including sovereign, quasi sovereign, bank and corporate debt. Previously, Seiz was a portfolio manager at Pine River Capital, focused on emerging markets fixed income.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:36AM ET</span>",SoftBank tightens grip on Yahoo Japan via $2 billion deal with Altaba,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group (T:9984) is increasing its stake in Yahoo Japan (T:4689) through a $2 billion, three-way deal with U.S. firm Altaba (O:AABA) to deepen ties with the internet heavyweight ahead of an IPO of its telecoms unit.
The transaction, with just $9 million net investment by SoftBank, allows it to boost ownership of Yahoo Japan without pressuring its already strained balance sheet. It also leaves SoftBank's domestic telecoms unit with a 12 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, highlighting for investors the two companies' ties ahead of its planned listing.
In the case of Altaba, formerly called  Yahoo Inc  which also owns about 15 percent of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), the deal helps monetize some of its investment in the joint venture it set up with SoftBank in 1996.
And for Yahoo Japan, the deal could strengthen ties with its biggest shareholder SoftBank and help to assuage concerns of investors who have seen its shares tumble this year. Yahoo Japan's shares ended 11.4 percent higher in Tokyo on Tuesday.
SoftBank announced on Tuesday it will buy 221 billion yen ($2 billion) of Yahoo Japan shares from Altaba. Yahoo Japan will then buy back 220 billion of stock from SoftBank.
As a result of the transaction, SoftBank's stake in Yahoo Japan will rise to 48.17 percent from 42.95 percent. 
SoftBank said in a statement the deal will strengthen cooperation between the company, one of Japan's big three telecoms firms, and Yahoo Japan, an internet heavyweight in areas such as news and shopping. 
The synergies between SoftBank and Yahoo Japan are ""consistent with SoftBank Group's broader strategic synergy group initiative,"" SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said in the statement.
SoftBank and its Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund standing at over $93 billion as of May last year, have been taking minority stakes in technology companies around the world that Son believes will come to dominate their respective fields. 
UNIT'S IPO
SoftBank is preparing to list its domestic telecoms unit in what could be the largest Japanese IPO in nearly two decades. 
Yahoo Japan could use SoftBank's telecom services to boost demand for online shopping and mobile payments among Japan's increasingly net-savvy shoppers. SoftBank, through Yahoo Japan and others, is offering its mobile users an increasingly wide range of top-up services in addition to a basic phone subscription.
Yahoo Japan is one of Japan's most successful internet companies, with its services from earthquake alerts to online auctions to weather forecasts ubiquitous in the lives of many consumers. 
But its investment plans to fend off competition from rivals such as  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) and new upstarts such as  Mercari  Inc (T:4385) have weighed on its shares, which are down more than 22 percent this year. 
""It's clear that using excess funds for share buybacks is the only way Yahoo Japan has to hold up its share price,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. The firm does not hold positions in Yahoo Japan or SoftBank.
Altaba has been selling down its Yahoo Japan stake. Two Altaba appointments to the Yahoo Japan board will step down as a result of the transaction announced on Tuesday. 
SoftBank shares ended up 2.1 percent on Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index (N225) finishing around 0.7 percent higher.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Stability needed after CEO exit, say Thyssenkrupp workers, foundation","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) workers and its leading shareholder will serve as an anchor of stability at the company following the sudden departure of Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, they told a German regional newspaper.
The remarks by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp's top shareholder with a 21 percent stake, are the first in several years to address the company's strategy, which has come under fire from activist investors.
Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder with an 18 percent stake, has demanded that the sprawling group be simplified, grant more independence to its business units and explore strategic options for them.
But Ursula Gather -- head of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation -- and Markus Grolms, trade union secretary at the IG Metall union and vice chairman of the group's supervisory board, suggested that radical change was not the answer.
""The foundation and labor representatives have always stood up for the stability of the company. That will not change in the future,"" they jointly told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ).
Between them, the foundation and labor representatives hold 12 of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, giving them a clear majority to block key strategic decisions. Both had voted in favor of a historic steel tie-up with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).
Gather has faced criticism for not backing Hiesinger strongly enough in the face of fierce opposition from activist investors, including Cevian and Elliott, with some sources saying this played a role in the CEO leaving so abruptly.
Hiesinger, which had led the elevator-to-submarines group since January 2011, unexpectedly resigned last week, just days after the deal with Tata Steel was signed.
Thyssenkrupp on Friday said it would start a structured process to find a successor to Hiesinger. Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said Stefan Kirsten, who served as Thyssenkrupp's finance chief between 2002-2006, would be an ""interesting option"".

Kirsten, 57, recently stepped down from his post as finance chief at real estate group Vonovia (DE:VNAn).

280,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Alan Alda's new life lesson is that people need to connect,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Based on the years Alan Alda has spent in your living room, you may think the 82-year-old actor is one of your best friends.
His ability to connect with audiences - since his breakout role as Hawkeye Pierce on ""M*A*S*H"" in the 1970s, through countless programs like ""The West Wing"" and ""30 Rock"" - has led to a new career promoting what Alda believes the world sorely needs.
His company, Alda Communication Training, helps business executives relate to people with more authenticity, clarity and empathy.
For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, Alda chatted about the wisdom he has taken away from a life lived both onscreen and off.
Q: As a struggling actor, what was the money situation like in the beginning?
A: I was married when I was 21 and almost immediately had three children. It was a good nine years or so before I made any kind of living. There were times I just couldn't afford to drink a can of beer at dinner – and the cheapest beer was only around $1 for six cans, but I still had to ration them.
To pay the rent I was a cab driver, I sold mutual funds – mainly to myself – and I was a doorman. Our first apartment was so tiny that the kitchen was actually located in a closet.
Q: Was it heartening when you finally started getting some gigs?
A: It was certainly less frustrating. But I had never really considered doing anything else. It was never about being rich and famous. I only expected to be able to do what I loved doing, and hopefully make a living at it.
Q: When M*A*S*H hit, what was it like to deal with extreme success?
A: It was a little disorienting. I had seen my father get famous when he was in his 30s, and it didn't seem like a terrific thing to be. I was wary of being famous, because it's really hard to adjust to. If you can be rich without being famous, I would definitely advise that.
Q: What money mistakes did you make early on?
A: I was advised to invest in a tax shelter, which turned out to be a huge mistake because it was a fraud. I got a phone call from a reporter from the New York Times while I was on set one day, and he said, ""So how do you feel about being in the same boat as Walter Cronkite? You were both defrauded on an investment.""
That was the first I had even heard about it. I was so dazed that I walked outside and ran right into an iron pole. I lost pretty much everything I had, so that was a hard lesson.
Q: How has the launch gone for your communications company?
A: What you learn to do as an actor is to really connect to another person. I realized you could teach regular people to do that, too. So I started a center for communication science at Stony Brook University, and then a training company that has worked with thousands of people, mostly scientists and doctors. That work led to my book, ""If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look On My Face?"" and my podcast ""Clear+Vivid.""
Q: Since you are so interested in science, is that where your philanthropic dollars go?
A: I work a lot with St. Jude's, a wonderful research hospital that helps children and doesn't charge families anything. Those efforts are led by my good friend Marlo Thomas, who has an amazing ability to get things done, raising something like $1 billion a year for them. Now there is a fantastic communicator – you have to be good to raise that much money.
Q: What lessons are you passing along to your kids and grandkids?

A: I have three daughters and eight grandkids, and a lot of us have improvised together. I love that they have an interest in it, because it certainly changed my life. Improvising is life-changing, because it makes you a different person, a better person. It puts you in touch with your creativity, and you begin to trust yourself more, and censor yourself less. Most importantly, you have to listen to the other person – it's not just about you.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 06:18AM ET</span>",Tesla moves first to hike prices in China as trade war hits car makers,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has hiked prices on its Model X and S cars by about 20 percent in China, the first automaker to do so in the world's top automotive market in response to mounting trade tensions between the countries.
The move is the earliest indication of how much higher Chinese tariffs on certain U.S. imports will flow through to buyers, with other automakers likely to follow suit or shift a greater portion of production to China.
""It's only chapter one of this story,"" said James Chao, a Shanghai-based analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, who expects more companies worldwide to be hurt by the trade spat.
China slapped retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent on imports of several U.S. products, including cars, after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods.
China's tariffs are expected to hurt automakers, firms that make industrial components in the United States, and producers of soybean, whisky and other agricultural items.
For Tesla especially, rapidly burning cash and struggling to turn a profit, China is key. Sales in the country accounted for about 17 percent of its revenue last year.
In May, Tesla slashed up to $14,000 off its Model X in China after Beijing said it would cut import tariffs to 15 percent from 25 percent for most vehicles from July 1. 
But the latest retaliatory tariffs mean importers will have to fork out a total 40 percent duty on all U.S.-made cars they sell in China.
Tesla's price hikes kicked in over the weekend.
Its basic Model S sedan in China now costs about 849,900 yuan ($128,779), versus 710,579 yuan in May, while a Model X sport-utility vehicle costs about 927,200 yuan, versus 775,579 yuan, according to Tesla's website.
These prices are more than 70 percent higher than in the United States where the basic Model S sedan sells for $74,500.
""Raising the prices is going to hurt sales, but money-losing Tesla has to raise prices because they can't afford to fully absorb the higher costs of the tariffs,"" CFRA research analyst Efraim Levy said. ""Considering they claim to be capacity-constrained, they should be able to shift sales elsewhere."" 
NEW TESLA PLANT
Tesla's price increases come as it plans to build a factory in Shanghai to serve the Chinese market. The company ships more than 15,000 cars a year to China.
CEO Elon Musk is expected to visit Shanghai on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plans. Musk will also visit Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday, Bloomberg added, quoting one of the sources.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Analysts were divided on whether the price hikes will bother affluent buyers in China where, in big cities like Shanghai and Shenze, it is considered a status symbol to own a Tesla.
""Tesla consumers are a unique group of rich people. They want more of a brand image and product experience, price is less of a concern,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Automotive Foresight. 
IHS Markit's Chao, however, said many wealthy Chinese buyers were becoming more price conscious.
Other foreign automakers that could announce price increases in China include German automakers BMW and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn). 
BMW recently said it was unable to ""completely absorb"" the new tariffs, while Daimler has flagged that it ""aims to maintain a competitive position"" in China. Both firms import U.S.-produced cars into the Asian nation. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has, however, said it would not hike prices on its imported cars for now, crimping its profit margins.

Dark pools, known officially in Hong Kong as alternative liquidity pools (ALPs), are anonymous trading platforms offered by banks to help large investors trade big blocks of shares without having news of their orders move the price.
The pools have attracted attention from regulators around the world and led some banks to close pools.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said it carried out a review of ALPs between 2016 and 2017 and became concerned about Citi Match, the dark pool operated by Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.
Citi Match failed to comply with ""the relevant requirements"" from December 2015 to August 2016, the regulator said.
It said an incorrect system setting for client profiles had allowed more than 130 clients to access the ALP without being assessed as to whether they were qualified investors.
The U.S. bank said that it cooperated with the commission and had already taken remedial actions.
""Citi would like to confirm that there was no financial impact on affected clients, who were all qualified investors, and no client opted-out of Citi Match after being specifically provided with the ALP guidelines, which were available at all relevant times on Citi's website,"" the bank said in a statement.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is not one of the ""public officials under accusation"", the statement said. It was issued after Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber met with his Malaysian counterpart Tommy Thomas in Kuala Lumpur.
1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB as it is known, is at the center of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Malaysia and the United States.
The U.S. Department of Justice has said an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, a fund founded by Najib.
Najib, prime minister until a shock May 9 election loss, was arrested and charged last week by Malaysian authorities for abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in connection with transactions linked to SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB.
Najib pleaded not guilty to all the charges and was released on bail. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.
SWISS INVESTIGATION
The six people under investigation by Swiss authorities are two former officials from 1MDB, two former officials from Abu Dhabi sovereign funds and two officials of Saudi energy group Petrosaudi, the Swiss Attorney General's statement said.
At a press conference, Lauber said Switzerland was investigating funds linked to both 1MDB and SRC.
""The whole funding of 1MDB and SRC International is about $7 billion,"" Lauber said, referring to the funds his office says originated from 1MDB and SRC and flowed through the global financial system from 2009 to 2015.
""This is just what we saw in our investigations in Switzerland, so a part (of it) most likely went through Switzerland and other parts went somewhere else,"" he said.

Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier that former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Tim Leissner was in talks with U.S. prosecutors to potentially plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from an alleged scheme to steal billions of dollars from 1MDB.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 05:24AM ET</span>",U.S. earnings hopes and trade war lull keep world shares near three-week high,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares hovered near three-week highs on Tuesday, supported by optimism about U.S. company earnings and expectations that global economic growth can withstand trade tensions, although political bickering kept British markets on the backfoot.
Wall Street was set for a firmer opening after enjoying its best session in a month on Monday, its gains filtering across Asia, where bourses from Hong Kong to Tokyo ended the day firmer.
European shares also rose, with a pan-European equity index up 0.2 percent after touching a two-week high on Monday, while MSCI's all-country equity index touched a three-week high before easing back as Chinese shares fell into the red at the close of trading.
Analysts said markets, especially in Asia, remain on edge over the possibility of an escalation in trade wars after China and the United States last week slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods. 
While that has spurred fears of a global growth slowdown that would hurt equities and commodities, there have not been fresh salvos fired since. Markets also took heart from U.S. jobs data that suggest that the U.S. Federal Reserve might not tighten policy as aggressively as some feared, while German export figures and Chinese factory gate prices have offered some reassurance on economic momentum.
Above all, investors are pinning hopes on U.S. second-quarter results, which start in earnest this week and are expected to showcase growth of more than 20 percent across all sectors, thanks to recent tax cuts, high oil prices and robust growth.
https://tmsnrt.rs/2MrffP3
""Markets are anticipating a strong U.S. earnings season, led by energy, healthcare and tech. We are more downbeat on Europe,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. 
Futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq pointed to a stronger opening after the previous day's jump that was driven by banks before heavyweight lenders JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Citi report earnings on July 13.
With banks estimated to have enjoyed a quarterly windfall of as much as $5 billion from the tax cuts, S&P's banks index posted its sharpest rise since March 26 on Monday.
Figures late on Monday also showed that U.S. consumer credit surging in May to 7.6 percent on the year, maintaining the strong economic narrative. 
However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, meaning analysts will scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust earnings expectations for the rest of 2018. 
""I doubt the upcoming earning season will carry world markets to new highs. The numbers will be strong but equity markets are dominated by the outlook and we know the outlook is clouded by the trade issue,"" Garnry added.
POUNDED
Currency markets are dominated by political turmoil in London where Prime Minister Theresa May's foreign minister and Brexit negotiator both quit on Monday in protest at her plans to keep close trade ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. 
The fear is that the resignations will lead to all-out rebellion in the ruling party's ranks, toppling May or even triggering fresh elections. While this looks unlikely now, the uncertainty saw sterling sink as much as $1.3225 at one stage before recovering to $1.3245. 
""We anticipate elevated headline risks for sterling over the coming weeks,"" analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia told clients, though they noted that sterling's cheap ""real"" valuation -- against trade partners' currencies and adjusted for inflation -- could cushion it against further sharp falls.
A Bank of England rate hike may also support the pound, with markets assigning a roughly 60 percent chance of a 25 basis-point rate hike in August.
The pound's pain helped the U.S. dollar rise off 3-1/2 week lows against a basket of currencies, but the index stayed flat on the day.
Politics dominated markets in Turkey, where President Tayyip Erdogan's new cabinet lacked familiar market-friendly names and included instead his son-in-law as finance minister. 
Turkish five-year credit default swaps (CDS), which are used to insure against default or restructuring, rose 22 bps since Monday's close to 297 bps, although the lira bounced after suffering a 3 percent slump on Tuesday, its biggest daily fall in two years.
Meanwhile, Brent crude - up almost 20 percent this year - rose another $1 per barrel to $79 as a Norwegian oil workers' strike added to the picture of supply shortages following output disruptions in Canada and Libya. 

Money managers have raised bullish bets on crude in the week to July 3, data showed on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday as investors shifted from worrying about a trade war to focusing on a corporate earnings season expected to deliver solid results.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rose 0.2 percent by 0830 GMT, a 2 1/2-week high, and headed for its sixth straight day of gains as commodities shares supported the market in the face of rising protectionism. 
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) declined 0.1 percent, however, as the pound recovered from Monday's drop after top-level government resignations. 
Fading concern over trade had pushed Wall Street and Asian stocks up overnight as well. 
""It’s more of an absence of bad news rather than outright positive news that has driven the trade story over the last few days,"" said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.
Oil stocks (SXEP) were the biggest boost to the index, rising 1 percent. Crude prices climbed on concern over potential supply shortages as Norwegian oil workers prepared to strike later in the day. 
Industrials stocks like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn),  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), among the worst-hit by news of tariffs, also boosted the European index. Trade-sensitive luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) extended their recovery rally.
Overall, analysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the STOXX 600 before Europe's earnings season kicks off in earnest. But on Tuesday disappointing results caused the most eye-catching moves. 
Shares in interdealer broker TP ICAP (L:TCAPI) sank as much as 31.5 percent to a two-year low, on pace for their worst day ever. The company announced its CEO would depart and warned on profit, blaming Brexit-related costs.
Ocado (L:OCDO) shares fell 2.4 percent after the online supermarket said its 2018 pre-tax loss would exceed market consensus as investment spending cut into first-half earnings.
Among notable gainers, speciality chemicals firm  Wacker Chemie  (DE:WCHG) rose 2.8 percent after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts raised the stock to buy from hold.
""We think the market is overestimating the impact of renewed price pressure in polysilicon for solar and at the same time underestimating the value of Wacker's Silicones business,"" they wrote. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) shares rose 2.7 percent, with traders saying Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill-Lynch added the stock to its ""Europe 1"" list of preferred stocks. 
Shares in German wind turbine maker  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) jumped 5.6 percent after it won its biggest single contract ever, for a 595-megawatt wind turbine order in Brazil.
Biotech and pharma shares (SXDP) rose 0.4 percent as M&A and drug trial results boosted some small caps in the sector. 
UK specialist healthcare services company Cambian (L:CMBNC) soared 35 percent to the top of the small-cap index (FTSC) after saying it got a $536 million takeover offer from Caretech Holdings (L:CTH).
Switzerland-listed biotech company Cassiopea (S:SKIN) jumped 37 percent after positive trials for its Winlevi acne treatment.

Takeda in a press release said it received unconditional clearance from the United States Federal Trade Commission.
The Tokyo-listed firm is still awaiting approval from regulators in China, the European Union and elsewhere, as well from shareholders of both parties.
Chief Executive Christophe Weber has been working to persuade investors about the deal's cost-saving merits. However, concerns of the financial burden the combined company will carry has weighed heavily on Takeda's stock price.
Takeda shares closed flat on Tuesday ahead of the announcement. The stock is down 16 percent since the firm first said at the end of March it was considering bidding for Shire.

The drugmaker expects the deal to close in the first half of 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Japanese drugstores, traditionally conservative businesses that focused predominantly on pharmaceuticals, hit record highs earlier this year as customers increasingly looked to such outlets for their grocery needs.
The sector's lofty valuations have led to some profit taking over the past month, however, investors expect long-term growth in drugstore stocks, helped by lower outlays than their larger supermarket rivals and higher margins from pharmaceutical offerings.
Sector data from the Japan Association of Chain Drug Stores showed the industry posting constant growth over the past decade, with a total drugstore sales hitting a record 6.85 trillion yen the last fiscal year, up 38 percent from 10 years earlier.

Drugstore operators such as  MatsumotoKiyoshi Holdings Co  (T:3088),  Tsuruha Holdings Inc  (T:3391) and  Welcia Holdings  Co (T:3141) have succeeded in getting customers to buy discounted food items such as milk, tofu and cup noodles. Food and other items sold 1.78 trillion yen last fiscal year, accounting for about 26 percent of total sales.
Yet drugstores' main goal is to get frugal customers to buy high-margin over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics, which are their cash cows.
""Drugstores do not expect to be profitable by selling fresh produce. They hope customers to buy drugs and cosmetics, which generate gross margins of about 30 percent,"" said Jun Kawahara, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.
Analysts said that drugstores, which have been sprawling at fast pace, are better positioned to open new outlets due to their lower investment costs. While it costs about 1 billion yen to open a new supermarket store, a company would spend about 300 million yen to open a small drugstore, Kawahara said.
While individual supermarkets need land for parking, mass refrigeration and meat preparation, multiple drugstores can be supplied by one warehouse.
In the last fiscal year, industry association data showed that the total number of drugstores reached a record 19,534 nationwide, almost double the number of supermarkets.

In contrast, convenience stores' growth is threatened by higher wage costs due to a national labor shortage.
Over the past year, shares of MatsumotoKiyoshi have jumped 50 percent, Tsuruha by 15 percent and Welcia by 45 percent, while the benchmark Nikkei has gained 10 percent. Matsumotokiyoshi trades at 22 times its projected earnings, while Tsuruha at 25.81, Welcia at 34.90 and the Nikkei trades at 16.25.

After reaching record highs in May and June, drugstores' share prices have pulled back over the past month, in part triggered by a conservative annual profit outlook by Tsuruha Holdings.
""Drugstores have benefited from eating another subsector's market share. The challenge they face now would be how they can stay competitive within the industry,"" said Keita Kubota, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

""I'm confident a breakup will not happen because that wouldn't make sense (for Xerox) in terms of the energy, money and time it would take to do so,"" Fuji Xerox President Kouichi Tamai told Reuters in an interview.
Photocopier maker Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Japan's Fujifilm and the rest by U.S. copier firm Xerox, is central to a months-long battle between the partners over a $6.1 billion merger combining Xerox with the 56-year-old venture.
Xerox in May pulled out of the proposed merger prompting Fujifilm to file a lawsuit in June. Xerox subsequently said it may not renew its technology agreement with Fuji Xerox.
The U.S. firm, which relies on Fuji Xerox for most of its office copiers, also said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox's primary Asia-Pacific market.
For Fuji Xerox, a breakup with Xerox could result in the loss of over $1 billion in revenue. But Tamai said turning to other vendors would be disadvantageous for Xerox.
""That would increase costs for Xerox,"" he said. ""It is my responsibility to convince Xerox that it is cheaper and more reasonable to source products from us.""

""My mission is to persuade Xerox executives that the merger would be the best solution for both companies,"" he said. ""Daily interactions with them actually have given me a feeling that many at Xerox actually support the merger.""

(Reuters) - India's domestic institutional investors have been sapping up shares this year, helping put a floor under its stock markets even as foreigners flee on concerns over the country's accelerating consumer prices, rising global yields and a falling rupee.
That has propelled Indian shares close to a new high for 2018, outperforming most of their faltering Asian peers this year.
India's broader index (NSEI) has gained about 3 percent this year, compared with a 5 percent fall in MSCI Asia ex-Japan index (MIAPJ0000PUS) as emerging markets were hit by rising global yields and escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
""Foreigners are selling Indian equities this year. However, local investors keep buying them because domestic investors have shifted their investment focus from other traditional asset classes such as gold and real estates toward equity markets,"" said Saurabh Jain, AVP- Research at SMC Global Securities.
""Also the low interest rates in bank deposit, growing income levels in smaller towns, together with financial inclusion policies have attracted retail investors toward mutual funds.""
Foreigners have sold $750 million in Indian equities in the first half of 2018, compared with about $10.5 billion worth of purchases by domestic funds, data from stock exchange and mutual fund association showed.

India's mutual fund industry has mobilized 341.8 billion Indian rupees ($4.98 billion) through SIPs in the first five months of 2018, a 60 percent growth compared to last year, data from the Association of Mutual Funds of India showed.
""The investors have not really seen significant hit on their SIP returns as yet and so the inflows should continue,"" said Rajat Agarwal, as strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""We continue to think that the domestic liquidity will support the equity markets,""

301,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 02:32AM ET</span>",Old fashion: Vintage boom buoys RealReal and jolts luxury labels,"By Sarah White and Melissa Fares
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Second-hand fashion, once confined to thrift stores, is outstripping sales growth in the primary luxury goods sector, helping market leader The RealReal expand its business and prompting international labels to look at tie-ups.
Sales of second-hand, or vintage, luxury goods - from Chanel handbags and Gucci dresses to Rolex watches - are thriving on dedicated web platforms that are drawing a younger clientele seeking bargains and championing recycling.
The RealReal could be ready to list on the stock market within two years, when it expects the value of goods sold on the site to have roughly doubled to $1 billion annually, its founder and CEO told Reuters.
The seven-year-old U.S. company is also in talks with high-end brands like Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) over potential partnerships, Julie Wainwright said. 
Luxury labels have hitherto shunned the second-hand trade, fearing diluting their exclusivity and cannibalizing their sales. But they are now finding it hard to ignore a second-hand luxury business that is worth $25 billion in annual revenue and is expected to grow by up to 10 percent annually in coming years, according to Berenberg analysts. 
That is more than twice the projected pace of growth of the much larger primary market.
While there are few indications so far that they are planning in-house ventures, brands including LVMH and Kering are now talking to vintage sites as they try to figure out how they might extract some value from the burgeoning sector, The RealReal and executives from other resellers said. 
LVMH did not return requests to comment. Kering has said it is ""testing things with The RealReal"", without elaborating. 
FRIEND OR FOE TO BRANDS?
Second-hand platforms make their money by taking a cut of the resale price of an item, anything from 10 percent to 50 percent depending on the product and how much the seller has sold via the site.
The RealReal is facing growing competition from rival resellers looking to cash in on the booming market, including thredUP, which branched into luxury last year, and established players like Vestiaire Collective. 
For The RealReal and its rivals, partnerships with big brands could raise their profile and give them an edge. 
They declined to disclose details about the tie-ups they were discussing. But some executives, including Vestiaire CEO Sebastien Fabre, said deals could include data-sharing that allow brands to track what kind of people were buying and selling their products, and how items' value was holding. Such information could inform their marketing campaigns and pricing.
The RealReal's existing partnership with British label Stella McCartney could also serve as a model. 
The brand actively encourages shoppers to recycle its clothes by offering $100 vouchers, half paid for by The RealReal, to spend on new products in stores for every old Stella McCartney item they sell on the site. 
Resale platforms are betting most luxury firms will prefer to opt for strategic alliances rather than to go it alone, in part because the logistics of second-hand sales can be daunting. 
Resellers said labels were also increasingly convinced by their argument that rather than threaten luxury sales, they may help funnel money back to brands. 
The RealReal's Wainwright said about a fifth of the money that sellers made was spent on buying items on the site, suggesting a significant proportion might go back into the broader apparel market. 
""I think we're past the point where they may have felt we were a threat,"" she said. ""For many millennials it's their first-time experience with a luxury brand on our site.""
'I ALSO SHOP AT PRADA'
The RealReal has a 100-strong team of anti-counterfeiters to weed out fakes, and processes between 200,000 to 300,000 products a month. Vestiaire, which also works with authenticators, adds 6,000 new products a day to its site, after 30 percent of all items submitted for resale are rejected. 
Prices and discounts vary considerably, with determining factors including the condition of the item and how in demand a brand if at that moment.
For example, shoppers on The RealReal can buy a 2015 black lace top from Givenchy for 1210 euros ($1,416), around a third of the original price, while polka-dotted Balenciaga high heels from last year were down to 374 euros from around 876 euros.
Yet some things hold their value or even fetch premiums second-hand. A maroon Hermes Birkin bag made of ostrich leather from 2009 is on the RealReal at 21,130 euros when its 2017 retail price as a new product was around 15,000 euros.
In New York's Soho district, Chinese student Fan Tu shopped for pre-owned items from Prada (HK:1913) and LVMH label Celine at The RealReal's store - its first, with a second due to open in Los Angeles in August. 
Tu, who had raised about $4,500 from selling used clothes via The RealReal this year, said she was not just after bargains - rather anything that caught her eye from her favorite labels, new or old. 
""I also shop at Celine, right across the street, and at Prada, two blocks away,"" she said, clutching a pair of her old Chanel boots and Dolce & Gabbana loafers destined for resale.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2018 12:42AM ET</span>",Former Goldman Sachs banker in 1MDB plea talks with U.S.: WSJ,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (N:GS) banker is in talks with U.S. prosecutors to potentially plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from an alleged scheme to steal billions of dollars from a Malaysian state investment fund, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The report said the talks bring the fast-moving investigation closer to Goldman, which raised billions of dollars for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
It also comes after Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, who founded the fund and lost his re-election bid earlier this year, was charged with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in relation to SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.
Najib pleaded not guilty to those charges and has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.
Tim Leissner, a one-time Goldman partner and Southeast Asia chairman hasn't been charged. He is seeking an agreement with prosecutors that would involve his co-operation with the government's criminal fraud probe into 1MDB and Goldman, the report said.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) declined to comment. A lawyer for Leissner also declined to comment.
A Goldman Sachs spokesman told Reuters: ""Since we suspended Mr. Leissner, we have discovered certain activities he undertook that were deliberately hidden from the firm, which we have brought to the attention of the relevant authorities who continue to receive our full cooperation.""
Last month, citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that Malaysia is considering asking the DoJ to get Goldman Sachs to return nearly $600 million in fees it earned from bonds raised for 1MDB.
Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB. More than $2.5 billion raised from these bonds was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates, according to DoJ civil lawsuits filed in a U.S. court in 2016.
Goldman earned almost $600 million for the three deals – an amount critics say is far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.
Goldman has maintained that the outsized fees related to the additional risks it took on – it bought the un-rated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of the 2013 deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds in a hurry for a planned investment.
The WSJ said one potential charge Leissner could ultimately plead guilty to would be a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans the use of bribes to foreign officials to get or keep business.
The report said prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn are also investigating whether Goldman violated any laws.

Japan's auto industry has been plagued by uncertainty since U.S. President Donald Trump last year launched a renegotiation of NAFTA, seeking to repatriate manufacturing jobs to the United States. Automobiles and auto parts are key export products for the country.
Jtekt President Tetsuo Agata said prospective automaker clients were waiting for the outcome of the talks before making new decisions on their Mexico operations.
""They are watching the NAFTA situation carefully. So we also have to hold off on new production plans,"" he told reporters at its Nagoya headquarters.
Jtekt is a Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) group supplier that manufactures vehicle steering systems for the automaker and other customers. It operates a plant in San Luis Potosí state in Mexico.
Jtekt also operates more than 10 plants in the United States, mainly in Tennessee, South Carolina and Texas.
Most of Japan's major automakers and suppliers operate plants in the United States. Top producers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) locally produce about 50 percent to 70 percent of all vehicles sold in the country.
They also operate plants in Mexico and Canada, exporting a portion of the output from those plants, along with some vehicles made in other countries, to the United States.
In addition to uncertainties surrounding NAFTA talks, Japanese automakers have also been rankled by Washington's move in May to launch a national security investigation into car and truck imports to the country which could lead to new tariffs.

Japan's automobile lobby has criticized any regulations which could raise costs for Japanese automakers doing business in the United States, the world's No. 2 auto market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. state attorneys general is investigating whether Five Guys, Panera, Burger King and other big fast food chains are using ""no-poach"" rules in franchise agreements to hold down wages and limit employee advancement, the officials said on Monday.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, along with attorneys general of nine other states and Washington, DC, sent letters to Arby’s, Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), Dunkin' Donuts (O:DNKN), Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Little Caesars, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA), Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Wendy's (O:WEN) to ask for franchise agreements and other documents that relate to no-poach provisions.
Under a no-poach pact, companies agree to not hire away each other's workers.
The companies were asked to detail any no-poach pacts, including being asked whether they informed employees of potential agreements.
Restaurant workers make a median of $9.81 per hour and $20,410 annually, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
""By limiting potential job opportunities, these agreements may restrict employees' ability to improve their earning potential and the economic security of their families,"" the attorneys general said in the letter.
Wendy's spokeswoman Heidi Schauer said the company did not have an anti-poaching provision in franchise agreements.
""Wendy's does not impose any restrictions that prohibit franchisees from hiring or soliciting employees from other franchisees,"" she said in an email.
Arby’s, Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, Five Guys, Little Caesars, Panera and Popeyes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Justice Department has said that no-poach agreements are illegal under antitrust law since they restrict competition for employees and potentially deprive workers of better job opportunities. They have been found previously in the railroad industry and among some tech companies.
The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this probe.
In June, a former McDonald’s (N:MCD) employee, Leinani Deslandes, filed a lawsuit against the chain alleging the restaurant’s no-poach agreement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and had prevented her from obtaining a better position with a rival franchise.

Jurisdictions in the probe include California, District of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

312,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Xiaomi's Ill-Timed Debut Sows Doubt About Internet Ambitions,"(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp.’s market debut has failed to convince investors that it’s capable of shedding a reliance on cheap phones and becoming an internet giant. The Chinese smartphone giant now faces intense scrutiny while it tries to prove it should be twice as expensive as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
After raising $4.7 billion in an initial public offering selling stock at the bottom of its marketed range, the first day of trade saw the shares slide as much as 6 percent in Hong Kong. The IPO had been touted as the culmination of a remarkable turnaround and the starting gun for a clutch of mega debuts but it came amid sliding markets and an escalating trade spat between the U.S. and China.
Co-founded by billionaire Lei Jun, Xiaomi has a market value of about $50 billion, a far cry from the $100 billion touted last year. The 1.2 percent slide at the close of trade is the worst first-day performance for a $1 billion-plus Hong Kong IPO since 2015.
Such a high-profile stumble may have a chilling effect on a swathe of Chinese tech corporations keen on raising capital to fuel their ambitions, from Meituan Dianping in Hong Kong to Tencent Music in the U.S. It’s a disappointing showing for an eight-year-old smartphone label with designs on expanding globally and transforming from a low-margin hardware company into an internet services player in Apple’s mold.
Xiaomi priced its IPO at earnings multiples higher than more established tech giants, including Apple, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., arguing it was an internet services company even as most of its revenue came from hardware. It then suffered a number of setbacks, from being forced to jettison plans to sell Chinese depositary receipts in Shanghai to the onset of trade tensions.
“It will be hard to convince investors,” said Elsie Sheng, an analyst with Orient Finance Holdings. “Although it claims to be an internet company with lots of big data-related businesses, it remains a hardware company in terms of source of revenue. Even in smartphones, most of the devices it sells are lower-end products.”
In the longer term, Xiaomi’s proponents argue that dominance in markets from India to China and a diversifying Internet of Things business will help it grow into its valuation. As Lei Jun struck the opening gong Monday, he continued pitching Xiaomi as an “internet company.”
While the company won’t be included in MSCI Inc.’s global benchmarks, it will join the Hang Seng Composite Index on July 23.
Xiaomi’s IPO was hailed as the most important Chinese technology debut in years, attracting A-list investors such as George Soros and fellow billionaires Li Ka-shing, Jack Ma and Pony Ma. Institutional investors including Hillhouse Capital, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and China Mobile Ltd. also chipped in.
While $50 billion isn’t insignificant for a company many wrote off when sales flatlined in 2016, it’s still barely grown from its $46 billion valuation from a 2014 fundraising round.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and CLSA Ltd. were Xiaomi’s joint sponsors.
“Tech companies looking to list their shares will need to take a more conservative approach in pricing,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s “as investors get more cautious about where to put their money given the prevailing trade tensions and several IPO flops recently.”
Xiaomi’s tribulations began almost the moment it embarked on its IPO journey. It’d planned on raising about $10 billion at a valuation of as much as $100 billion by taking advantage of CDRs: an instrument Beijing pushed to entice companies to list at home. But that fell apart when it couldn’t adequately address questions posed by regulators.
Regardless of market gyrations, the company has amassed billions to bankroll Lei’s vision of embracing technology from artificial intelligence to cloud computing, pitting itself against  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). It’s a far cry from a year or so ago, when the billionaire prompted a bout of internal soul-searching via a heartfelt missive to employees.
Selling phones into overseas developed markets might be a more realistic goal, given Xiaomi’s growing credibility with affordable but reliable devices, than building a full-fledged internet content and services wing.
“It really depends on the speed of growth -- that’s the open question right now,” Ryan Roberts, a senior analyst for MCM Partners, told Bloomberg Television. “If they can maintain that, that’s going to bring margin expansion just from the revenue mix.”
Lei, who once drew comparisons in domestic media to Steve Jobs, has resumed taking potshots at Apple. On Monday, the billionaire made it a point to thank his deep-pocketed backers and the 190 million monthly active users known as Mi Fans.
“Although the macro-economic conditions are far from ideal, we believe a great company can still rise to the challenge and distinguish itself,” Lei told a packed audience at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

317,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Pepsi Reports Earnings With Margins in Focus
With the Independence Day holiday in the rearview mirror, Wall Street turns its attention to second-quarter earnings.
The bulk of reports start next week, but this week still has some major names issuing results, starting Tuesday morning with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).
On average, analysts expect Pepsi to report quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, on revenue of $16.09 billion.
Gross margins will be of particular interest to investors.
Last week,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) downgraded Pepsi to hold from buy. Deutsche’s analyst predicted a drop in quarterly gross profit margin due to commodities inflation.
2. Job Openings Expected to Decline
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow, but more employment numbers will arrive.
The JOLTs job openings data are scheduled for 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that job vacancies dropped to 6.583 million in June from 6.698 million in May.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose more than expected, while wage growth was lower than forecast last month.
Before the bell, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) small business optimism index is released at 6:00 AM ET (10:00 GMT). Economists predict a drop to 105.6 in June from 107.8 in May.
3. Currencies See Action as Brexit Resignations Pile Up
The currency market could also garner some extra attention from investors after Monday’s whipsaw action.
The pound struggled after the resignation of Boris Johnson as U.K. foreign secretary. Johnson became the third member of the government to resign within 24 hours in protest over plans for a soft Brexit.
GBP/USD came under pressure, falling 0.32% to $1.3245.
The pound dropped against the dollar and the euro. If dollar strength continues, that could put pressure on shares of companies that rely on a weaker dollar to boost international revenue."

Fox's offer is expected to be at a premium to Comcast's most recent bid of 12.50 pounds per share, the Financial Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.
The company could make the new offer as soon as this week if its earlier bid for Sky is formally approved by the UK government, according to the report. 
Rupert Murdoch's Fox had initially launched a 10.75 pound-a-share bid to buy all of Sky in December 2016.

323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Big Winners This Earnings Season Are Those Most at Risk in Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war is officially here. So is earnings season. Corporate America isn’t about to let one ruin the other.
As executives prepare to release results for the second time this year, it’s the very companies with the most on the line in President Donald Trump’s commerce crusade that are poised to report the strongest second-quarter numbers. Technology, materials and energy stocks have the most overseas sales -- and the highest profit forecasts.
While trade tension may have put a lid on investment gains, it has done little to earnings estimates. Through all the back-and-forth, analysts have been raising forecasts. They’re predicting 20 percent growth in the April-to-June period, the second-fastest rate since 2011, behind the first quarter.
“Concern over trade shouldn’t be ignored, but we probably are not going to see the effect of a trade war just yet,” said Don Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp. “Analysts are increasing their estimates as they’re probably saying, ‘Look, things may change in the next quarter or two. But in the quarter that just passed, this company and this sector exposed to trade probably did pretty well.’ ”
Technology companies, many of which rely on Chinese plants to manufacture chips, have traded sideways since reaching a record in June. And yet the sector will probably show 31 percent earnings growth in the second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Energy firms likely saw their profits rise by 132 percent in the period, while materials firms likely posted a 33 percent profit growth in the same time.
Sector-specific stimuli are outweighing trade concerns, according to Selkin. Software and Internet firms are insinuating themselves into the workflow of everything from banks to soapmakers to drug developers, boosting sales at a much faster pace than any tariff is likely to reduce them -- for now. Energy companies are feasting as oil prices hover near the highest level since 2014 and while commodity prices have been volatile, they spent the second quarter at levels comfortably above the year-ago period.
“While tariffs pose a risk to market sentiment, the potential impact to aggregate S&P 500 EPS is limited given exports to China comprise just 1 percent of U.S. GDP,” wrote David Kostin, Goldman Sachs’ chief U.S. equity strategist, who said a trade war with China will hurt stock prices but not so much earnings growth. “Despite its limited aggregate impact, tariffs will have a disparate influence at the stock level,” especially on firms with high China sales, he said.
Still, while materials companies have seen 12-month target prices dip slightly over the past three months, other industries have seen them rise. Energy and tech stocks saw analyst price forecasts rise by 6.9 and 3.4 percent, the most among industry groups.
“It will be a while until we get a deeper understanding of the impact of tariffs, over the next several months and perhaps by the year-end, and then investors will have the data to revise their earnings expectations and revenue growth expectations in the outer years,” said Chad Morganlander, a portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. “Overall, companies’ results will continue to be vibrant on the top-line, but the overriding concern about trade shouldn’t been ignored.”"
324,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",IEX hires former ISE executive Ilyevsky to lead market development,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchange operator IEX Group said on Monday it has hired Boris Ilyevsky, a former long-time executive of the options-focused International Securities Exchange (ISE), to lead market development, including a potential expansion into options.
Ilyevsky, who spent 17 years at ISE before it was bought by Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in 2016, will help IEX explore ""potential opportunities for strategic diversification,"" the company said in a statement.
""I'm looking forward to using my industry experience and looking critically at markets where IEX could make a major impact by providing a fair and unconflicted choice,"" Ilyevsky said.
IEX operates the Investors Exchange, whose launch in 2016 followed the company's prominent appearance in Michael Lewis' 2014 nonfiction bestseller ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt."" 
""Flash Boys"" focused on IEX's founders as they sought to create what they deemed a fairer marketplace for investors, utilizing a so-called speed bump that slowed down stock orders with the aim of preventing predatory trading practices. Other exchanges initially opposed the speed bump, though some later adopted or proposed versions of their own. 
But market share growth at IEX, which unlike most of its rivals does not pay rebates to brokers that send it orders, stalled out at around 2.5 percent.
Ilyevsky, who oversaw the launch and development of two new equity derivatives markets while at ISE, will consider a number of broad areas for potential expansion by IEX, including the options market, IEX President Ronan Ryan said in a statement to Reuters.
""But we have no plans to enter that market at this point,"" Ryan said, referring to the options market.
IEX has also said it plans to start a corporate listings program this year, in a challenge to the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE).

NEW YORK (LPC) - A record $1.45 trillion of US syndicated lending to companies for acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, dividends and refinancing in the first half of the year has propelled bank fees from arranging the loans to all-time highs.
The $8.1 billion earned in the first half of this year slightly topped the prior record $8 billion taken in during the second half of last year, setting a new peak, according to Freeman Consulting Services.
The lending pace escalated in the second quarter and is seen staying heated through year-end, encouraged by lower US corporate tax rates and a federal judge’s June endorsement of the long-pursued mega-merger between AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner.
Bankers eagerly awaited the outcome of the AT&T/Time Warner ruling, long after the deal was first announced in October 2016, and now expect the decision to keep the chute wide open for similar mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in coming months.
For lower-rated borrowers, there is less onerous enforcement under this administration of leveraged lending guidelines put in place five years ago to rein in high-risk practices. 
“The market was firing on all cylinders in the second quarter,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting. “There were plenty of new-money loans from both corporate M&A and leveraged buyouts, and it looks like more to come given the relaxed regulatory environment and strong stock market.”
At the current pace, fees will reach an annual record for banks lending to blue-chip as well as to highly indebted companies, according to Freeman, which estimates fees based on Thomson Reuters data.
Fees of nearly $6.6 billion earned by banks in the first half for extending leveraged loans to lower-rated borrowers topped $5.8 billion in the same half last year by more than 14 percent, roughly matching the all-time high for any six-month period set in the second half of last year.
The mix of deals, which has increasingly shifted to new funding rather than lower-margin refinancing loans, is also propping up fee income.
Among the loans boosting the leveraged fee pool were those made to back auto parts maker Tenneco’s purchase of Federal-Mogul from Icahn Enterprises, Amneal Pharmaceuticals’ merger with fellow generics drug maker Impax Laboratories, and building products manufacturer Ply Gem Holdings’ take-private by buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.
ALL-CLEAR
For extending loans to high-quality companies, banks earned about $1.5 billion in the first half of the year, a 44 percent spike from a year earlier and the highest half-year tally on record.
“For investment grade companies, it’s still a very strong M&A environment – stock prices are high, so sellers are willing to sell, and buyers are willing to bid their stock to get assets,” Nassof said.
At the same time, interest rates have risen but remain low historically, while the economy and corporate profits are growing.
“Debt financing is cheap, so that’s not really any inhibitor to financing a big deal,” Nassof said. The AT&T/Time Warner decision, he added, “is going to be a boost for deals, giving potential buyers the all-clear signal.”
Among the fee drivers in the first half in the high-grade sector were loans backing Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp’s bid to buy Sky Plc (LON:SKYB), Walt Disney’s offer to buy Fox media assets and Conagra Brands’ purchase of Pinnacle Foods.
Rising first-half syndicated lending helped to boost the total US investment banking fee pool to an all-time high for any six-month period.

When adding bank earnings from equity and bond underwriting, as well as M&A advisory to the syndicated loan arrangement fees, the total US investment banking fee pool jumped $26.7 billion in the first half, slightly edging out the second half of last year.

MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (SZ:300750) (CATL) will build its first production site in Europe in Germany, agreeing a major contract with BMW (DE:BMWG) to supply lithium-ion batteries. 
Europe's lack of its own production capabilities for the cells that power electric cars has prompted warnings that it could leave its car industry exposed and too reliant on others. 
A contract to build the new plant was signed on Monday during a visit to Germany by China's Premier Li Keqiang. 
Around 240 million euros ($280 million) will be invested in the first phase of the project, Wolfgang Tiefensee, Thuringia's minister of economic affairs, told journalists. 
BMW plans to source 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) of battery cells from CATL over the next few years, with 1.5 billion euros coming from the new site in Erfurt in eastern Germany, the carmaker's purchasing head, Markus Duesmann, said.
CATL, the world's largest maker of battery cells for electric vehicles, said the new factory was just its first step in Europe. 
""We want to supply all the OEMs (manufacturers) in Europe,"" Chairman Robin Zeng said. ""If the Thuringia project is successful then we can consider other locations."" 
The CATL factory will create about 600 jobs and reach production of 14 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2022. CATL reached shipments of 12 GWh in 2017. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the CATL investment was a good step but said it did not rule out Europe eventually competing with the Chinese. ""If we could do it ourselves, then I would not be upset,"" Merkel said. 
The VDMA engineering industry association said it hoped CATL's investment could help drive further investment in battery technology in Europe. 
Duesmann said earlier BMW had invested in some of the costs for the CATL factory in Erfurt, but both he and Zeng declined to say how much.
Duesmann said BMW was investing in cell research but a decision on whether to produce battery cells itself had not been made. ""I don't rule it out,"" he said. 
BMW is ""very comfortable"" with two suppliers of battery cells at the moment, but could add a third and is in talks with eight manufacturers, he added. 
Duesmann said he would welcome it if other carmakers also wanted to invest in the Erfurt plant. 
However, BMW has no plans to jointly purchase cells with rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), he said, because of the competitive advantage that can be gained if batteries give greater range or can be charged faster.
Daimler said its strategy was to buy components where they are produced. ""We welcome the decision of CATL to manufacture in Germany and are in talks regarding this,"" a spokesman said.
Ambitious plans for electric vehicle battery production have driven sharp price rises in recent years for lithium and cobalt, which is used to stabilize and extend the life of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, and has raised fears over the security of supply of those metals.
BMW is sourcing raw materials for the cells itself to pass to the battery makers, in particular cobalt, and is currently negotiating long-term contracts. 
Duesmann said BMW would only conclude contracts where inhuman conditions and child labor were ruled out. It said it was not sourcing cobalt from mines in Democratic Republic of Congo.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>",Comcast lining up buyers for Fox sports assets: sources,"By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) is identifying potential buyers for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) regional sports networks in an attempt to ease antitrust concerns about a new bid to acquire most of Fox's assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Comcast hopes that preparing now for such divestitures will ease Fox's concerns over potential antitrust risks and boost the chances of its bid disrupting Fox's agreed $71 billion cash-and-stock deal to sell the assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), the sources said on Monday.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice gave the go-ahead to Disney's acquisition of the Fox assets, asking Disney, which owns sports network ESPN, to divest all of Fox's 22 regional sports networks, known as RSNs, on antitrust grounds. These networks could be worth as much as $20 billion, according to the sources.
Comcast, which made a $65 billion all-cash offer for the Fox assets last month only for Disney to raise its bid, is talking to private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) and Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), to gauge interest about acquiring the RSNs, the sources said. It is possible that a telecommunications or media company might also express interest in purchasing the RSNs, the sources added.
Comcast believes finding such partners will not only allow it to argue that it can win antitrust approval for the Fox assets as easily as Disney, but will also boost its finances as its prepares to make a second all-cash offer later this month, the sources said.
Fox shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Disney deal on July 27. Comcast is planning to make its bid before then, according to the sources.
Comcast is open to negotiating with regulators the number of RSNs it would have to divest, though it believes only eight Fox RSNs would overlap with Comcast’s sports footprint, according to the sources.
The terms of Comcast's upcoming new offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast and Fox did not respond to requests for comment. Disney, Apollo and Blackstone declined to comment.
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Comcast was exploring tie-ups with other companies or private equity investors for its bid for the Fox assets.
Comcast has been stocking up on live sports content, which is popular with advertisers because large audiences watch the events in real time without being able to skip the commercials. Its NBCUniversal unit carries coverage of the Olympic Games exclusively in the United States. 

Comcast is also competing against Disney to acquire control of European broadcaster Sky Plc (L:SKYB), in which Fox already owns a 39 percent stake. Comcast in April offered 12.50 pounds per share for Sky, equivalent to $31 billion, topping Fox's 10.75 pounds per share bid for the 61 percent it does not own.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 12:12PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court upholds Volkswagen's $10 billion diesel settlement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday upheld Volkswagen's $10.03 billion settlement with the owners of nearly 500,000 polluting diesel vehicles announced in 2016.
The three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said, in dismissing a number of objections to the settlement, that it ""delivered tangible, substantial benefits to class members, seemingly the equivalent of — or superior to —those obtainable after successful litigation, and was arrived at after a momentous effort.""
In total, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buybacks will continue through the end of 2019.
The ruling on Monday pertained to the settlement covering the owners and former owners of 475,000 polluting 2.0-liter vehicles. VW agreed to offer owners of the 2.0 liter vehicles between $5,100 and $10,000 in compensation, in addition to the estimated value of the vehicle.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the appeals court decision.
The German automaker admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. cars to cheat government exhaust emissions tests. The vehicles had emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollutants.
In May, federal prosecutors in Detroit unsealed criminal charges against former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn. Two other former VW employees have pleaded guilty in the investigation and are serving prison terms. In total, nine people have been charged in the United States.
Last month, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler was arrested in Germany, but he has not been charged. VW suspended him and named an interim CEO.
Volkswagen has paid more than $7.4 billion to buy back about 350,000 of 475,000 2.0-liter U.S. diesel vehicles through mid-February, according to court filings, and has fixed or removed from the road 86 percent of all 2009-2015 2.0-liter diesel vehicles. The company reached a separate settlement covering 80,000 3.0-liter diesels and agreed to buy back about 20,000 of those vehicles.
The appeals court rejected a challenge to the 2.0-liter settlement that stipulated that any of the $10 billion not spent will revert to VW. It also rejected challenges to the court's approval of the class, the fairness of the settlement itself and the adequacy of the court process in approving it.
Last month, VW said it would pay owners of some diesel vehicles up to $1,000 in additional payments to settle state lawsuits in Vermont and Arizona.

In 2016, VW reached a $603 million consumer fraud settlement with 44 U.S. states. Since then it has settled with five other states - including Vermont - worth more than $120 million. The only state with a pending consumer fraud action is New Mexico.

The slump wiped about $3 billion from the microblogging site's market valuation, which had stood at about $35 billion on Friday. Twitter shares were last down 8.6 percent at $42.62.
""Such reaction is due likely to the assumption that the lower user count would attract less ad dollars,"" Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said.
Mogharabi, however, pointed to big advertisers now paying more attention to the quality content alongside which their ads are placed.
The company has suspended more than one million accounts a day in recent months to reduce the flow of misinformation on the platform, the Washington Post reported late on Friday, citing data it obtained.
Twitter declined to confirm the figures reported by the Washington Post.
""MAU may continue to be negatively impacted in future periods due to our ongoing information quality efforts... While the magnitude of any potential future impacts is difficult to predict, we believe that DAU (Daily Active Users) will be less affected than MAU,"" Twitter had said in a letter http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2F526X/3624411864x0x978170/BC4C8EE1-93F6-4182-8D61-FE51F36CBFC7/Q1_2018_Shareholder_Letter.pdf to shareholders during the first quarter.

Twitter reported 336 million MAU in the first quarter. MAU is expected to grow nearly 3 percent to 337.06 million in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Renato Chaves filed the complaint with regulator CVM late on Friday, arguing that the transaction would effectively grant control of Embraer to Boeing, disrespecting its statute, Valor reported.
""It is a disguised acquisition of a controlling stake,"" Valor quoted Chaves as saying.
Embraer's statute forbids any investor to own 35 percent or more of its shares directly or indirectly. 
Chaves is a former director for pension fund Previ, which manages pensions for employees of state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3). Valor did not specify the size of the Chaves' stake in Embraer, but said he acknowledged that the stake was very small.
A representative for CVM could not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Chaves could not be reached for comment.
Complaints are typically uploaded to CVM's website once assessed by the regulator's technical body. The complaint reported by Valor had not been uploaded.
Boeing and Embraer agreed last week to set up a $4.75 billion joint venture encompassing Embraer's airliner business, helping the American company face up to Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway has rejected a suggestion it is holding up Tesla's (O:TSLA) efforts to improve service in its third-biggest market, saying the electric carmaker has not yet applied to use the mobile service vans it says it needs to solve its problems.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last week blamed a wait for government approval in Norway, its biggest market after the United States and China, for not being able to move faster in addressing growing complaints from consumers.
The Norwegian Consumer Council said on July 4 Tesla had climbed to fourth place in the first six months of 2018 in the list of companies Norwegians complain about the most, up from 24th in 2017.
Musk tweeted in response: ""Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.""
But Norway's public roads authority said it had not yet seen a formal application from the company.
""Tesla Norway has recently been in a dialogue with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) about regulations for allowing workshops or the possibility of so-called 'mobile service vans',"" The Norwegian transport ministry said in a statement to Reuters late on Friday.
""The NPRA gave its answer on June 1, explained the rules that are valid and that they would welcome a potential application from Tesla Norway to allow mobile service vans. The NPRA has for the moment not received, as of today, such an application.""
Tesla Norway said media queries should be handled by its European press office, which was not immediately available for comment.
In 2017 sales of electric and hybrid cars accounted for more than half of new registrations in Norway, a record aided by generous subsidies.

LONDON (Reuters) - The EU's banking regulator said on Monday it planned to issue a ruling on the treatment of $3.5 billion of complex financial instruments issued by UniCredit (MI:CRDI) that a hedge fund says are wrongly classified by the bank as best quality capital.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) did not give a timeframe for its planned public judgment.
British hedge fund firm Caius Capital asked the EBA in May to open an investigation into the 2.98 billion euro ($3.51 billion) convertible and subordinated hybrid equity-linked securities, known as CASHES, which UniCredit issued in 2008.
Caius believes UniCredit, Italy's biggest bank by assets, should convert the transaction into shares, which would increase the bank's Common Equity Tier (CET) 1 capital ratio, but cause big losses for holders of the CASHES.

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (T:7201) said on Monday it had improperly measured exhaust emissions and fuel economy for 19 vehicle models sold in Japan, the second case in less than a year where misconduct has been discovered in its inspection processes.
Nissan said it had found sample test environments for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan were not in line with domestic standards, and that inspection reports were based on altered measurements.
The incident is the latest in a growing list of data tampering in Japan which has tarnished the image of the country's manufacturing industry, known for high-quality, efficient production.
The latest misconduct does not impact vehicles exported overseas, as it applies to requirements intended specifically for the Japanese market, Nissan said.
Shares in the Japanese automaker closed down about 5 percent at their lowest in more than a year. The news came after the close of trading, but the company had said earlier it would make an announcement about its emissions tests, sparking concerns.
The admission came after Nissan said in October that for decades uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan, triggering a domestic recall of 1.2 million vehicles. 
""This is a deep and serious issue for our company,"" Chief Operating Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi told reporters at a briefing.
""We realize that our compliance awareness remains lacking,"" he said, adding the company would carry out an investigation into the issue to determine the root causes, which it expects will take a month or more.
The issue was discovered during voluntary compliance checks it launched following last year's vehicle inspection scandal, and affects models including the Note, the subcompact hatchback which is Nissan's top-selling model in Japan, and the Juke SUV crossover.
Of around 2,200 sample tests performed at six plants producing Nissan vehicles, 1,200 at five locations showed some form of falsification, Nissan said.
The automaker discovered incidents in which vehicle driving speeds and durations, along with external temperatures, had not been in line with Japanese regulations for emissions testing, while testing equipment had not been calibrated properly.
In addition, mileage data were overstated in some cases to make them appear more favorable. 
No recalls were necessary as the misconduct did not compromise the safety of the affected models, and mileage readings were in line with levels presented in product catalogues, Nissan said. 
According to currently available data, tampering incidents date back to 2013 and involved 10 employees, although Yamauchi said it was possible that older data may show the problem could go back further. 
Nissan last year blamed its use of uncertified inspectors on staff shortages, a scandal which contributed to a slide in full-year operating profit in the year ended March.
Domestic rival Subaru Corp (T:7270) in April admitted to similar misconduct in its testing regime.

Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",China unicorn funds launch after much hype but lukewarm interest,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Once marketed with great fanfare as an ""epoch-making gala for investors,"" the six Chinese ""unicorn"" funds quietly began operations on Monday - alongside  Xiaomi  Corp's lackluster Hong Kong debut - after raising just one third of their original targets.
The six funds, launched to support mainland listings of home-grown tech firms such as smartphone maker Xiaomi (HK:1810) and e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, originally sought to raise 300 billion yuan ($45.33 billion) from retail and institutional investors.
But they ended up with only 104.9 billion yuan among them, according statements published over the weekend, despite a massive marketing effort orchestrated by Chinese regulators.
The shortfall reflects reduced appetite for much-hyped tech IPOs in a market roiled by trade war fears. And investors are showing some distrust toward funding projects orchestrated by the Chinese government.
The funds were promoted as a special opportunity for mom-and-pop investors, who are allowed for the first time to participate in tech IPOs as cornerstone investors along with institutions.
But retail investor David Song said he was not impressed.
""I'm very cautious toward such innovative funds, and I know little about CDRs,"" Song said, referring to Chinese Depository Receipts, the instruments overseas-listed firms use for domestic listings, and to which the funds will subscribe.
China Southern Fund Management, China Merchants Fund and E Fund declined to comment. The other three funds, China AMC, Harvest and China Universal, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Some investors have drawn parallels between the unicorn funds and China's first outbound ""QDII"" funds promoted by the government 11 years ago. Those funds burned investors after global markets collapsed during the 2008/09 financial crisis.
""The smell is very similar,"" wrote Huang Tao, strategist at Beijing Heju Investment, adding that in both eras, valuations of overseas tech firms were near historic levels and were surrounded by hype. ""I believe history will repeat itself.""
In a potentially ominous sign, Xiaomi shares fell as much as 6 percent during their debut in Hong Kong because of valuation concerns.
In mainland China, investor enthusiasm toward unicorns - tech companies valued at more than $1 billion - has also cooled rapidly.
Investor Zhu Haifeng said he didn't buy into the unicorn funds, which have a lock-up period of three years, because of the risk.
""There could be a further sell-off in China's financial assets in the next few years,"" he said. He added that he doubted valuations of tech companies such as Xiaomi could persist.
Xiaomi, citing market conditions, has postponed its plan to list in China via CDRs, stirring speculation that other overseas-listed companies would follow suit.
That means the unicorn funds would have to initially put the money to work in fixed-income products if there are no IPOs that require cornerstone investors, according to the funds' sales documents.
""It could be a good thing as it could potentially enable the funds to participate in IPOs in a cooler market, where shares would not be too much overpriced,"" said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabian Airlines in Boeing 777X order talks: sources,"By Alexander Cornwell and Tim Hepher
DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Airlines is exploring a potential order for Boeing (N:BA) 777X widebody jets, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
It was not immediately clear when Saudi Arabia's state-owned airline, also known as Saudia, could reach a deal or how many 777X jets it is interested in.
Boeing declined to comment. Saudia did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The airline's director-general Saleh bin Nasser al-Jasser told Reuters last November that a wide-body jet order would be considered in 2018.
A potential Saudia order could alleviate production pressure for Boeing which is now unlikely to sell 80 jets that IranAir ordered before the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran and said it would reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally, welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the agreement that had reopened global trade with Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities.
Companies from Saudi Arabia and the United States have signed business deals worth tens of billions of dollars since Trump took office in 2017.
The discussions also come at a time when doubts have been expressed about the solidity of existing 777X orders from the Gulf, particularly from Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways which is restructuring after accumulating $3.5 billion in losses in the past two years.
The 777X is an upgrade to Boeing's successful mini-jumbo series. The 406-seat 777-9 is due to enter service in 2020. 
Saudia operates a mixed fleet of 148 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, including 777 twin-engined jets, according to its website.

Saudia has been restructuring since 2015, divesting from non-core businesses with the plan of returning to profitability by 2020.

Several industry analysts are predicting a quieter summer air show this year as the industry digests a record order backlog of more than 15,000 aircraft, spread across all types.
But higher oil prices could prompt several airlines and lessors to top up orders for fuel-efficient narrowbody models using the cash from industry restructuring, said IBA, one of a handful of companies which also carry out aircraft valuations.
""Airlines have historically placed orders when times are good and cash is strong, much like today,"" Stuart Hatcher, Chief Operating Officer of UK-based IBA Group, said in a report.
A copy was provided to Reuters ahead of publication. 
It is the first detailed order forecast ahead of the July 16-22 event, held every other year in alternation with Paris. 
On average, the summer jamborees account for 30 percent of annual commercial business, according to IBA. At the 2017 Paris show, planemakers bagged around 900 firm or provisional orders.
Airlines are benefiting from rising traffic and higher passenger load factors, meaning more people are on average traveling in more crowded planes.
However, there are some negatives for airline managements, with capacity beginning to outstrip traffic growth and labor pressures, interest rates and oil prices all rising.
Since the financial crisis, the correlation between oil prices and jet orders has been ""uncannily strong,"" despite the negative impact of oil on airline profits, Hatcher said.
""In all, the order tally (firm and provisional) could top 900 again ... but increasing costs for the airlines may prevent the orderbook rising by too much.""
This includes a combined total of 600 Airbus A320neo and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX - the latest narrowbody models with new engines - and a tentative forecast of 100 wide-body jets. Small models and turboprops could also get a boost from rising oil prices.
The number of immediate firm orders is expected to be much lower as provisional deals take weeks or months to finalize.
Leasing companies could again be buyers this year due to weakness in the sale-and-leaseback market - their alternative source of new aircraft, in which they buy freshly delivered planes from airlines and rent them back out.
They are expected to place 40 percent of new orders at Farnborough, IBA said.

An obstacle to significant new orders is the long waiting list of eight years, following an extended industry upcycle.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 05:12AM ET</span>","Third of sovereign funds plan to cut equity holdings, cite trade war fear","By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Over a third of sovereign investors plan to cut their equity exposure over the next three years after a strong run in 2017, citing trade wars, geopolitics and high valuations as headwinds to performance, a study by asset manager Invesco showed.
The annual report, which is based on interviews with 126 sovereign investors and central bank reserve managers with $17 trillion in assets, found equities had overtaken bonds to become the biggest asset class in portfolios, averaging 33 percent. This is up from 29 percent in 2017. 
Nearly half of sovereign investors are now incrementally or materially overweight equities, but while 40 percent said they were happy with the status quo, 35 percent plan to reduce their equity exposure over the medium term, Invesco noted.
The interviews were conducted January to March, a volatile quarter for world stocks, and some investors believe they remain vulnerable to a correction. 
Among the main concerns cited were the possibility of a trade war, geopolitical risks, and the fact that equity valuations are high both on an absolute and relative basis. 
Since March, the United States has escalated its trade dispute with China and other key trading partners, sending global equities into a tailspin. 
Investors are concerned that the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs will hamper exporting nations and crimp global economic growth. 
Alex Millar, head of EMEA sovereigns at Invesco, said survey participants had been ""pretty far-sighted"" in highlighting the risk of a trade war early in the year. 
But he noted investors were still keen to get risk into their portfolios to generate returns, saying: ""Last year, they were paid to stay in equities."" 
Total average returns topped 9.4 percent in 2017, up from 4.1 percent in 2016. But sovereign investors were less optimistic about the outlook for 2018, expecting to make 5.8 percent - undershooting their targeted return of 6.5 percent.
""Equities had a good run last year, but this hasn't caused investors to change their long-term expectations – they think returns going forward will be tough,"" said Millar.
Partly this is a function of low interest rates, which have encouraged sovereign investors to build a strategic allocation to alternatives such as private equity, real estate and infrastructure. 
The study noted that the average allocation to alternatives has doubled over the past five years to an all-time high of 20 percent in 2017. Some large sovereigns with a high tolerance for illiquidity said they planned to ramp up alternatives further, towards 50 percent in certain cases. 
However, deployment remains a challenge, with investors taking an average of 3.2 years to put committed capital to work in private equity and infrastructure, while real estate averages 2.6 years. 
Millar said the rise in equity holdings was partly due to some investors parking money there instead of in cash while seeking suitable alternatives deals. 
Investors reported seeing fewer attractive opportunities in private equity as competition has bid up prices, with some 61 percent saying it was overvalued.
Conversely, interest in private credit has grown, with some 63 percent saying they had increased their strategic asset allocation to this segment over the last three years. 

Millar said this was a relatively easy strategy to implement due to lower competition, and it gave a higher yield than regular fixed income. ""Also, since the financial crisis, a lot of banks have pulled back from lending, which provided an opportunity for private credit funds to fill that gap,"" he added.

412,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Xiaomi's Ill-Timed Debut Sows Doubt About its Internet Ambitions,"(Bloomberg) --  Xiaomi  Corp's (HK:1810) market debut has failed to convince investors that it’s capable of shedding a reliance on cheap phones and becoming an internet giant. The Chinese smartphone giant now faces intense scrutiny while it tries to prove it should be twice as expensive as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
After raising $4.7 billion in an initial public offering selling stock at the bottom of its marketed range, the first day of trade saw the shares slide as much as 6 percent in Hong Kong. The IPO had been touted as the culmination of a remarkable turnaround and the starting gun for a clutch of mega debuts but it came amid sliding markets and an escalating trade spat between the U.S. and China.
Co-founded by billionaire Lei Jun, Xiaomi has a market value of about $50 billion, a far cry from the $100 billion touted last year. The 1.2 percent slide at the close of trade is the worst first-day performance for a $1 billion-plus Hong Kong IPO since 2015.
Such a high-profile stumble may have a chilling effect on a swathe of Chinese tech corporations keen on raising capital to fuel their ambitions, from Meituan Dianping in Hong Kong to Tencent Music in the U.S. It’s a disappointing showing for an eight-year-old smartphone label with designs on expanding globally and transforming from a low-margin hardware company into an internet services player in Apple’s mold.
Xiaomi priced its IPO at earnings multiples higher than more established tech giants, including Apple, Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., arguing it was an internet services company even as most of its revenue came from hardware. It then suffered a number of setbacks, from being forced to jettison plans to sell Chinese depositary receipts in Shanghai to the onset of trade tensions.
“It will be hard to convince investors,” said Elsie Sheng, an analyst with Orient Finance Holdings. “Although it claims to be an internet company with lots of big data-related businesses, it remains a hardware company in terms of source of revenue. Even in smartphones, most of the devices it sells are lower-end products.”
In the longer term, Xiaomi’s proponents argue that dominance in markets from India to China and a diversifying Internet of Things business will help it grow into its valuation. As Lei Jun struck the opening gong Monday, he continued pitching Xiaomi as an “internet company.”
Xiaomi’s IPO was hailed as the most important Chinese technology debut in years, attracting A-list investors such as George Soros and fellow billionaires Li Ka-shing, Jack Ma and Pony Ma. Institutional investors including Hillhouse Capital, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and China Mobile Ltd. also chipped in.
While $50 billion isn’t insignificant for a company many wrote off when sales flatlined in 2016, it’s still barely grown from its $46 billion valuation from a 2014 fundraising round.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and CLSA Ltd. were Xiaomi’s joint sponsors.
“Tech companies looking to list their shares will need to take a more conservative approach in pricing,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s “as investors get more cautious about where to put their money given the prevailing trade tensions and several IPO flops recently.”
Xiaomi’s tribulations began almost the moment it embarked on its IPO journey. It’d planned on raising about $10 billion at a valuation of as much as $100 billion by taking advantage of CDRs: an instrument Beijing pushed to entice companies to list at home. But that fell apart when it couldn’t adequately address questions posed by regulators.
Regardless of market gyrations, the company has amassed billions to bankroll Lei’s vision of embracing technology from artificial intelligence to cloud computing, pitting itself against  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). It’s a far cry from a year or so ago, when the billionaire prompted a bout of internal soul-searching via a heartfelt missive to employees.
Selling phones into overseas developed markets might be a more realistic goal, given Xiaomi’s growing credibility with affordable but reliable devices, than building a full-fledged internet content and services wing.
“It really depends on the speed of growth -- that’s the open question right now,” Ryan Roberts, a senior analyst for MCM Partners, told Bloomberg Television. “If they can maintain that, that’s going to bring margin expansion just from the revenue mix.”
Lei, who once drew comparisons in domestic media to Steve Jobs, has resumed taking potshots at Apple. On Monday, the billionaire made it a point to thank his deep-pocketed backers and the 190 million monthly active users known as Mi Fans.
“Although the macro-economic conditions are far from ideal, we believe a great company can still rise to the challenge and distinguish itself,” Lei told a packed audience at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened higher on Monday as a wave of optimism about the resilience of the global economy spread across markets despite the escalation of the U.S.-China trade dispute and a new Brexit crisis within the British government.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.6 percent by 0813 GMT while the British blue chip index FTSE 100 (FTSE) gained 0.3 percent with gains across bourses and sectors. 
Positive job data in the United States on Friday reassured investors who have yet to witness a tangible slowdown due to the implementation of higher trade barriers. 
""The actual trade tariffs are nothing new, the market has been aware of them for over a month, and for now conditions are still supportive for financial growth, allowing markets to move higher"", argued London Capital Group's research team. 
""Sentiment could remain resilient until we see solid evidence of these trade tensions feed through to softer economic data, particularly in China"", they added. 
Data published on Monday also showed that ""German exports rebounded in May, providing more evidence of a strengthening of the economy in the second quarter"", ING wrote. 
In Britain, some investors took the view that the resignation of Brexit minister David Davis could actually help deliver a softer way out of the European Union. 
""It's unwelcome timing for the PM ahead of the UK's white paper (policy proposal) on Brexit, and before crucial talks with Brussels, but markets welcome the removal of a major impediment to a pro-business 'soft-Brexit',"" said Mike van Dulken and Artjom Hatsaturjants at Accendo Markets.
Global miner BHP Billiton (L:BLT) was a major mover on the British stock market, rising 2.1 percent on speculation that BP (L:BL) could buy its U.S. shale assets. BP slipped 1.1 percent. 
In Europe, Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) was one of the best performers, rising 7 percent after reporting higher passenger traffic for June while a leading French transport executive was touted as its possible new chief executive.
Oslo-listed seismic surveyor TGS-Nopec (OL:TGS) was also a notable gainer, rising 7.6 percent after unveiling a better than expected outlook.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), hit by strikes and without a CEO since May, reported higher passenger traffic for June on Monday, while a leading French transport executive was touted as its possible new chief executive.
The company said the group overall - comprising the Air France KLM, Hop! and Transavia networks - carried 9.3 million passengers in June, up 3.7 percent from a year earlier.
The overall load factor, a measure of the extent to which an airline has filled its planes, rose to 89.3 percent in June from 87.7 percent last year, it said.
The higher figures lifted Air France KLM shares, which were up 5.5 percent in early trading, although they remain down by roughly 44 percent so far in 2018, mainly due to the impact of the strikes on the company.
Air France KLM said last month it hoped to appoint a new CEO ""as quickly as possible"", against the backdrop of concerns by some shareholders over the process.
The airline has been hunting for a new boss since the abrupt departure of Jean-Marc Janaillac in May after staff rejected a pay proposal aimed at ending a series of strikes that have resulted in heavy losses.
French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Monday that Catherine Guillouard, chief executive of French public transport group RATP, was being considered for the Air France KLM CEO position.
An Air France KLM spokeswoman declined to comment.
Last week, France's transport minister Elisabeth Borne said it was important the new CEO of Air France KLM was an air transport specialist.
The French government has a stake of around 14 percent in Air France KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.
Irish brokerage Goodbody wrote in a research note that Guillouard could nevertheless be a good appointment, given her experience of dealing with unions and at Air France.
""Guillouard, has previously worked at Air France for 10 years in various roles including finance management, flight operations and human resources,"" wrote Goodbody.

""In 2001, serving as senior vice-president of Flight operations, she chaired the committee for the establishment of Flight operations where all of the company’s technical and commercial flight personnel trade unions are located and, as such, would have some experience of dealing with Air France unions,"" added Goodbody.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 03:25AM ET</span>","Starbucks' departing chairman backs China prospects, hints at Jack Ma tie-up","By Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp's (O:SBUX) outgoing Executive Chairman Howard Schultz said on Monday that a recent slowdown in China would be short-lived, seeking to salve investor concerns that the U.S. coffee chain is under pressure in the fast-growing market.
Schultz also hinted at a potential tie-up with e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) billionaire founder Jack Ma, that could help rev up online coffee sales for the chain in China.
Starbucks said last month China same-store sales would be flat to slightly negative in its second-biggest market in April-June, versus 7 percent growth a year earlier, triggering a sharp drop in the chain's share price.
Schultz, ostensibly on a farewell tour after he stepped down in June, said fears of a slowdown in the market were a ""false narrative"", and that over time the closely watched metric would regain its momentum.
""It's a very short-term number that Wall Street uses, it's not a number we're concerned about,"" he said at a roundtable at the firm's flagship Roastery store in Shanghai.
""I will say, unequivocally, that anyone who is betting against Starbucks in China is dead wrong.""
China has been a sweet spot for Starbucks for the past few years, with a burgeoning cafe culture driving rapid growth even as the market saturated back home. 
Schultz, who owned about 3 percent of Starbucks stock as of Dec. 18, sees China as overtaking the United States as Starbucks' top market, with the firm aiming to double cafe numbers there to 6,000 by 2022.
ALIBABA TIE-UP?
Starbucks has no formal online delivery in China, where Alibaba-backed Ele.me competes with Tencent Holdings Ltd-backed (HK:0700) Meituan-Dianping as the country's two biggest food delivery platforms.
Schultz, however, said he was close with Alibaba's Ma and suggested the two could work together to boost Starbucks' online distribution in China.
""There's no doubt that no brick-and-mortar retailer anywhere in the world, let alone China, can exist as a stand-alone business without having a significant, integrated e-commerce mobile application,"" he said. 
""I have been very dear and close friends with Jack Ma for many, many years... and suffice to say there will be news coming that will relate to our plans for accelerating and integrating mobile commerce at a higher level into our core business.""
Current trade tensions between the United States and China were creating a negative atmosphere between the two countries, he added, though he downplayed the impact on the chain.
""I think we will be able to navigate through this fairly well. Having said that I don't think it's a healthy atmosphere between the two countries and I hope it's short-lived.""
The long-time Starbucks executive said his next move was not yet clear, though he did not rule out a shift into politics.

""I want to do something that provides some level of public service, but I don't know what that will mean ... I would say I am taking the summer off and we'll see what happens,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Xiaomi Corp's shares fell as much as 6 percent in their Hong Kong debut on concerns over the Chinese smartphone maker's valuation, in an ominous sign for its technology sector peers who have lined up listings in the city.
The share performance of Xiaomi is a key test of investor sentiment for what is expected to be a packed initial public offering (IPO) calendar in the coming months. These include a $4 billion deal from online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform Meituan Dianping and an up to $10 billion IPO from China Tower, the world's largest mobile tower operator.
""Other IPO candidates will rush to Hong Kong to list before the market sentiment shifts. And they have to speed up the pace if they aim for a good valuation,"" said Hong Hao, chief strategist at brokerage BOCOM International.
""However, given the targeted high valuations of many new-economy IPO hopefuls and the number of IPOs going forward, it will be challenging for the market to digest all of them,"" Hong said.
Xiaomi priced its IPO at HK$17 per share, the bottom of the range it offered, raising $4.72 billion in the world's biggest technology float in four years.
Its shares touched a low of HK$16 in early trade and later rallied to briefly touch its IPO price. The stock was at HK$16.88 after the midday break, while the main Hong Kong stock market index was 1.7 percent higher.
Xiaomi's listing comes as investors fret over escalating trade tensions between the United States and China that have shaken markets over the past several weeks. The spat pushed Hong Kong's benchmark index to a nine-month low last week.
Asked if the low pricing of Xiaomi and some other technology firms will weigh on upcoming IPOs, Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Charles Li said at the Xiaomi listing ceremony: ""We cannot put a brake. The market is always open. It's open to everybody...If you don’t like the price, you can stay away.""
VALUATION
Xiaomi's IPO valued the firm, which also makes internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, at about $54 billion, almost half the $100 billion it had initially hoped for and below its more recent target of at least $70 billion. 
Xiaomi had been expected to raise up to $10 billion, split between its Hong Kong and a mainland offering. But in a surprise move last month, it postponed its mainland share offering. 
The HK$17 price valued the company at 39.6 times 2018 earnings, while iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 16 times and Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings at 36.
""Trading below the issue price suggested that investors still felt the valuation of the stock was relatively high as compared with Tencent and Apple,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.
Potential investors also struggled to view the company as the internet play it considers itself to be, rather than as a smartphone maker - the lower-margin business that currently generates most of its profits, sources said. 
""We are an internet firm. From day one, we've set up a dual-class share structure. Without the innovation of Hong Kong's capital markets, we wouldn't get a chance to go public in Hong Kong,"" Xiaomi's founder and chief executive Lei Jun told the listing ceremony at the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Xiaomi sold 2.18 billion shares, making the IPO the largest in the technology sector since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group raised $25 billion in New York in 2014.
The float adds to Hong Kong's $7 billion worth of new listings this year. It is also the first under the city's new rules permitting dual-class shares, common among U.S. tech firms, in an attempt to attract tech sector floats.
Xiaomi focuses on low-priced, high-performance smartphones and touts an innovative business model that features online services, a range of consumer electronics products built by partner firms, and a retail strategy that includes a network of physical stores.

It is now the biggest smartphone vendor in India and is pushing into European markets including Spain and Russia, though it has lost share in China recently to lower-cost rivals.

Japan's second-largest automaker said it would issue an explanation about its emissions measurement processes at 0800 GMT, sending its shares down to 999.5 yen each, their lowest since April 2017. Nissan declined to give further details. 
Japanese companies have admitted to several cases of data tampering over the past year, tarnishing the country's reputation for high-quality, efficient manufacturing.
In October last year, Nissan said that for decades uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in the country, triggering a domestic recall of 1.2 million vehicles. 
The automaker blamed staffing shortages for the misconduct, which contributed to a slide in full-year operating profit in the year ended March.
Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil. 

Domestic rival Subaru Corp (T:7270) in April admitted that employees had manipulated mileage readings on vehicles for the Japanese market, which followed the surfacing of domestic compliance failings last year.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",The Foxconns of fast beauty propel South Korean cosmetics' success in China,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - At a factory two hours south of Seoul, women clad in plastic caps and masks put peach-colored eye-shadow into cases, right next to a machine churning out a skin-color face powder.
The difference between the two lines: the first is supplying one of France’s best-known premium cosmetic brands, while the second is serving a South Korean budget firm.
The plant is operated by Cosmecca Korea (KQ:241710), the country's third-biggest contract cosmetics maker, which produces a range of products for more than 300 customers, all the way from high-end brands like  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) to nimble domestic firms such as Clio and Dr.Jart.
It is factories like this that have made South Korea the epicenter of fast beauty, a world in which the time it takes to get a product idea onto store shelves has dropped dramatically, often by years. This is vital as fickle millennial consumers can easily leave last year's hits as this year's busts.
Their dominance of the world of contract manufacturing for cosmetics may have become as important to the industry as Apple (O:AAPL) iPhone manufacturer Foxconn (TW:2354) has been for electronics.
Some of the major Korean brands they work for have been acquired by global cosmetics companies such as L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), and according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, the manufacturers themselves have received investment offers, some from foreign cosmetics firms.
South Korea's three largest contract manufacturers - Cosmax (KS:192820),  Korea Kolmar  (KS:161890) and Cosmecca - have all been approached by foreign investors about buying a minority stake in recent years, three people with direct knowledge of the situations told Reuters. The sources asked for anonymity and declined to elaborate further citing confidentiality of the approaches. 
One of the sources said one of the manufacturers had rejected a 2016 offer from an overseas cosmetics company for a minority stake, partly due to concerns that such an alliance could upset its broader customer base.
Representatives for the companies declined to comment. 
DEMAND FROM CHINESE BRANDS
Though largely staying in the background with little public recognition themselves, contract manufacturers stand to benefit as Korean brands they work for rapidly grow in China's $53.5billion cosmetics market. That's thanks to their value for money image, fast turnaround times for new products, and smart online marketing. 
China's own fast-growing cosmetics brands, albeit still small, are also driving the revenue growth of South Korean manufacturers, although margins on these contracts can be low, company officials say.
The stock market performance of the three has been mixed, though they have all outperformed the main benchmark in South Korea. 
Shares of global No.1 Cosmax (KS:192820), has gained 34percent year to date, far outpacing a 8 percent drop in the wider South Korean market (KS11). 
Cosmecca shares rose 8 percent and second-ranked Korea Kolmar (KS:161890) fell 3 percent in the same period. 
All three have, though, outperformed the 21 percent decline in shares of Amorepacific Group (KS:002790), South Korea's largest cosmetics powerhouse. Amorepacific, which uses both in-house and contract manufacturing, reported revenue fell 10 percent and operating profit slumped by nearly 30 percent in the first three months of2018. Its brands include the top-end Sulwhasoo, mass market Innisfree, and young makeup offering Etude House.
Even as all the top three contract firms, which are also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), posted revenue growth in the same period.
""The surge of smaller players gives tough times to beauty giants like Amorepacific. By contrast, this is a favorable environment for OEMs,"" said Park Jong-dae, an analyst at HanaInvestment & Securities. 
""While brand companies have up and downs, OEMs garner stable earnings. They are most suited to the industry's structural changes - Asian growth and diversified distribution channels."" STRUGGLING TO CATCH-UP 
In particular, they are central to the success in the high-growth China market of small Korean brands with new ideas but no production or research capabilities, industry executives and experts say. 
When French luxury giant LVMH's (PA:LVMH) private equity arm was conducting due diligence on Clio before buying a stake in2016, among its key questions was: ""How do you come up with new products at such a fast speed?,"" said Lim Mira, a manager atClio's strategic planning team. 
Contract manufacturers such as Cosmax deliver on orders much more quickly, in as fast as three months compared to about a year overseas contract manufacturers require, Lim said. 
The firm used to source products from an Italian contract manufacturer in the past, but has now shifted to Korean manufacturers, she said. 
""Many global players are struggling to catch up as the life cycle of any success has shortened, pushing them to come up with new innovations at a much faster speed,"" said Laura Chu, a China-based account director at researcher Kantar International. 
In China, Unilever's share declined from 3.2 percent in 2014to 2.8 percent in 2017, while L'Oreal's share fell from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent during the same period, according to research firm Euromonitor. 
Seeking to turn the tables, both Unilever and L'Oreal, as well as other European and American majors, have paid big premiums in the last two years to scoop up South Korean brands thriving in China. 
Unilever announced a 2.27 billion euro ($2.67 billion) deal for Carver Korea in September - maker of the A.H.C. cosmetics brand, whose China sales rose more than 30 percent in 2017,according to Kantar International. 
""Geographically it will enable us to strength our position in two of the top five largest skin care markets - China and Korea,"" Lizzy Chen, a U.K.-based executive at Unilever, told Reuters. 
South Korea-based Nanda, which was acquired by L'Oreal for an undisclosed sum in May, saw sales of its flagship cosmetics brand 3CE double in China last year. The strong performance was particularly notable given that last year a major spat between Seoul and Beijing over South Korea’s installation of a new U.S. missile defense system led to an unofficial boycott of South Korean brands in China. South Korean contract manufacturers have been expanding China production to meet surging demand.
Cosmecca's chairman Cho Im-rae said that in recent years it has been running its factories in China at full throttle. It is planning to open a third factory there. 

""China's cosmetics demand is growing enormously,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets rallied on Monday as favorable U.S. jobs data whetted risk appetites, while sterling slipped after two members of the British government resigned over Brexit and put the future of Prime Minister Theresa May in doubt.
The pound peeled off around a third of a U.S. cent to $1.3290 <GBP=D3> as news broke British Brexit Secretary David Davis and Brexit Minister Steven Baker had resigned.
The loss came just two days after a meeting at May's Chequers country residence supposedly sealed a cabinet deal on Brexit and underlines the deep divisions in her ruling Conservative Party over the departure from the EU.
""The outlook for the pound had brightened in recent weeks,"" said Westpac senior currency analyst Sean Callow, seeing a chance this could turn out positive for the currency.
""If the U.K. government presses ahead with this plan despite the unexpected resignation of “hard Brexit” officials and with the US dollar losing momentum, sterling should be able make a run at $1.35 multi-day.""
Sentiment in other markets was mostly positive after Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed tame wages and more people looking for work.
""The combination of rising employment and increased labor force participation suggests healthy but not tightening labor market conditions in June, something that will allow the Fed to continue to hike rates at a gradual pace,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), a senior U.S. economist at RBS (LON:RBS).
The balanced report helped Wall Street end last week in the black and Japan's Nikkei (N225) followed up with gains of 1.4 percent on Monday.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) climbed 1.1 percent, on top of 0.7 percent rally on Friday when the launch of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports came and went without too many fireworks.
NOT THAT BAD
""While trade tensions fan concerns about the future, incoming data show a soaring U.S. economy, a healthy labor market, and some rebound in Europe and Japan,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Michael Gapen.
""For now, overall policies and financial conditions still support growth and investment,"" he added. ""A sharper-than-expected China slowdown from a domestic credit crunch and external trade tensions could be the main risk to global growth.""
Chinese shares were attempting to rally on Monday with the Shangahi blue chip index (CSI300) up 1.9 percent after hitting its lowest in almost 18 months last week.
China's securities regulator said on Sunday it plans to ease restrictions on foreign investment in stock listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to attract more foreign capital and support the economy.
The focus this week would be on Chinese data for June covering inflation, new loans and international trade. The United States also releases inflation figures, while the Bank of Canada might well hike rates on Wednesday.
In currency markets, the U.S. dollar was mostly softer following the jobs report, with sterling being an exception.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar had pulled back to 93.937 (DXY), from a top of 94.486 on Friday. The euro held its gains at $1.1760 (EUR=), while the dollar was flat on the yen at 110.45.

429,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Xiaomi Makes Its Trading Debut on the Defensive,"(Bloomberg) -- (Bloomberg) -- It was hailed as the biggest and most important Chinese technology debut in years. Instead, Xiaomi Corp. begins life as a public company on the defensive, struggling to justify a lofty valuation while buffeted by a geopolitical storm beyond its control.
When billionaire Chairman Lei Jun strikes the gong on Monday in Hong Kong, he will usher onto public markets a company twice as expensive as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). that is pitching itself as a high-growth internet play on par with the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). At about $50 billion, Xiaomi will become the world’s third-largest publicly-traded maker of mobile devices, a standard-bearer for Chinese corporations seeking to become global players and leaders in technology.
That vision will soon get tested: institutional investors saw bids on the gray market 11 percent below the initial public offering price. That’s after Xiaomi’s IPO came in at the very bottom of a marketed range. If that level holds during actual trade, it may have a chilling effect on a swathe of tech corporations keen on raising capital this year to fuel their ambitions, from Meituan Dianping to Tencent Music. Longer-term however, Xiaomi’s expanding global footprint may help it grow into its valuation.
“The valuation I’ve put in our analysis is still aggressive for Xiaomi. But its aggressive for a reason and that’s obviously because Xiaomi has a very interesting footprint,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy for Saxo Bank. “The trade war could deal a negative impact on consumer sentiment in general, not only in China but also in the U.S. and globally. I think it’s the main risk.”
Xiaomi’s tribulations began almost the moment it embarked on its IPO journey. It’d planned on raising about $10 billion and a valuation of as much as $100 billion by taking advantage of Chinese depositary receipts: a new instrument Beijing pushed to entice companies to list at home. But that fell apart when it couldn’t adequately address 84 questions posed by regulators.
Key among those queries: why a company that gets the vast majority of revenue from phones would pitch itself as an internet company, putting it at a higher price tag than Tencent Holdings Ltd.
When Xiaomi finalized its offer, it did so just as the Hong Kong bourse went into a tailspin. Escalating tensions with the U.S. exacerbated growing concerns about the fallout from a slowing Chinese economy, fueling a climate of uncertainty. Compounding the challenge: traders can short-sell the stock from day one and Xiaomi won’t be considered for inclusion in benchmark MSCI gauges.
“It’s not looking like a very positive IPO to be honest,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equities at Soochow CSSD Capital Markets, who’s been monitoring Xiaomi and thinks it too richly valued. “It’s a wake-up call for realistic valuations, but its also a case of bad luck for Xiaomi’s timing.”
But Xiaomi may have no choice. Its last equity fundraising was in 2014 and it needed to bankroll Lei’s vision of expanding globally and embracing technology from artificial intelligence to cloud computing, areas where it would be pitted against  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).
Lei, who once drew comparisons in domestic media to Steve Jobs, has even resumed taking potshots at Apple. It’s a far cry from a year or so ago, when the billionaire prompted a bout of internal soul-searching via a heartfelt missive after sales flatlined in 2016.
It remains to be seen whether Xiaomi’s been penalized for circumstances beyond its control. The company has urged investors to recognize its worth as one of the few from China’s tech sector to make inroads abroad.
It’s taken pains to explain its strategy of selling cheap phones to goose revenue from services such as video and music, while investing in an ecosystem of connected devices from vacuums to watches.
“The problem with Xiaomi is that people are very confused. They are not clear about why you call yourself an internet company,” said Anthea Lai with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Many people won’t feel comfortable paying a price similar to Tencent, which has a proven track record, and a 100 percent of its profit came from internet.”

431,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2018 07:14PM ET</span>",Pain and pressure: market turmoil pushes some China funds to the brink,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - It's already been a harsh year for Chinese funds, hit by new rules aimed at reining in debt in the country's financial system. Now, the sell-off in China stocks induced by trade war anxiety further threatens their health and for some, their survival.
Case in point: private fund house Nanjing Hu Yang Investment Co has seen its assets under management halve to 50 million yuan ($7.5 million) over the past year on redemptions and investment losses.
Its chairman, Zhang Kaihua, said he is putting his funds, which bet on consumer stocks, into ""a state of dormancy"". He's also stopped publishing fund performances and shelved capital raising plans.
""Our only hope is that our existing clients can stick with us so that we can survive,"" he said, adding that he has seen many of his peers drop out of the market.
In the past when market turmoil has hit China's fund industry, such as in 2015, it has managed to bounce back on loose monetary policies and relaxations in rules for the sector.
But this time, asset managers face a double whammy of fleeing investors and a central bank keen to see a mopping up of excessive liquidity in the financial system - pointing to prolonged pain for the industry.
And as the U.S.-China trade war heats up - the two slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods on Friday - the worry is that further declines in Chinese shares (CSI300), which have fallen 10 percent since late June to two year-lows, could be the last straw for some funds.
""If the market continues to be this bad, I expect to see more liquidations,"" said Ivan Shi, head of research at Z-Ben Advisors.
REDEMPTIONS AND LIQUIDATIONS
According to Morningstar, fewer than 10 of the 800-plus Chinese equity mutual funds it tracks have made a positive return this year.
Even before trade war fears ramped up last month, changes to asset management rules first outlined in 2017 and aimed at encouraging banks to reel in their investments in stocks and bonds had taken their toll. Equity fundraising dwindled to minimal levels, while redemptions and liquidations spiked.
In the predominantly long-only mutual fund industry that numbers some 5,000-plus funds, 161 were liquidated during the first half of this year.
That's a jump from 102 for all of 2017, according to data from Z-Ben Advisors which notes that in the previous six years, the biggest number of liquidations was just 30 in 2015.
Figures for redemptions at balanced funds that invest in both stocks and bonds show a similar story. Just under 280 billion fund units, equivalent to 18 percent of the total, were redeemed in the first half of the year. That compares with about 330 billion fund units for the whole of 2017.
Tony Zhao, a retail investor in several balanced funds, said he's thinking of opting out after losing 10-20 percent of the principal in the funds.
""I'm considering selling when there's a rebound. The market correction this time is far more than I had imagined,"" he said, adding that he had expected Washington and Beijing would reach some sort of rapprochement over trade.
The private fund industry, where most players are long-only and relatively small, is particularly hurting.
Fundraising by private funds has been on a steady decline, dwindling to 2.39 billion yuan for the month of May, compared to 57 billion yuan a year ago, according to data from Shenzhen Qianhai Simuwang Fund Distribution Co.

""Fundraising is getting very difficult. We're in a bear market and I don't see improvement in the foreseeable future,"" said Wen Hao, CEO of fund manager Hao Fei Investment.
Wen said he's temporary shifting his focus away from the market and will concentrate on his hobby - internet film making. 
CRISIS ALPHA
Market volatility has, however, proven a tailwind for funds with so-called ""crisis alpha"" strategies that are designed to garner positive returns in times of crises.
""Rising volatility in A-share market has enabled some of our quantitative strategies to shine this year,"" said Xu Xiaoqing, managing director of hedge fund house Preston Asset Management Co.
Preston's flagship arbitrage strategy being promoted this year involves buying fixed income securities while hedging with other financial instruments. The model generated a near 10 percent return in the first six months alone, and is gaining traction among institutional clients such as insurers, Xu said. 
Shanghai Minghong Investment Management Co told a recent roadshow, that by shorting index futures while buying a select group of stocks expected to outperform the index, its ""market neutral"" funds benefited from the share tumble triggered by Trump's tariff threats against China. 
""We like market slumps ...the more emotional, the more chaotic the market is, the easier we generate alpha,"" said Xu Shijun, managing director at Shanghai Minghong.

In a further sign that China has become more accepting of funds with quantitative strategies, global hedge fund managers Bridgewater Associates LP and Winton Group Ltd have had their applications to launch products in China approved, registration notices last week showed.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2018 01:16PM ET</span>",China may delay new rules for wealth management products: Caixin,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China may delay the release of new regulations for banks' wealth management products (WMPs) because of recent market turmoil, financial publication Caixin reported on Sunday citing unidentified sources.
The new rules were expected to be announced between late June and early July, Caixin said. One source told the publication that regulators have opted to hold off on releasing the new guidelines and wait for a ""while"" because of the market volatility.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters in May the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) will soon publish the rules as part of a broader push to curb financial sector risk. Official data showed 562 banks held 29.54 trillion yuan ($4.45 trillion) in outstanding WMPs at the end of 2017.
CBIRC is likely to adjust the limit for bank wealth management products' exposure to non-standard investments, known widely as ""shadow banking"" products, one of the people told Reuters at the time.
But Chinese markets have swooned in recent weeks on worries about a protracted trade war between China and the United States, with the two governments implementing a new set of tariffs on Friday.
Top Chinese officials have repeatedly sought to assure markets in recent days that fundamentals of the world's second-biggest economy are sound and that recent turmoil has been overdone.

COSCO said on June 30 that all pre-conditions for the OOIL offer made last year had been met after receiving approval by the Chinese anti-monopoly regulator. It already has approvals from European and United States anti-monopoly regulators. 
In a regulatory filing on Sunday the company said the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had notified it that it does not have any outstanding security issues following an agreement with the U.S. government to divest the Long Beach container terminal business to a third party. COSCO said ownership of the container terminal business will be transferred to a trust while a buyer is sought.
There had been concerns the trade fight between Beijing and Washington might end up hampering major deals by U.S. or Chinese firms seeking regulatory approval.
U.S. and China on Friday implemented tariffs against each other's goods, with no signs of a near-term resolution.
COSCO's acquisition of OOIL will see the Chinese shipping giant become the world's third-largest container shipping line. 
The deal is the latest in a wave of mergers and acquisitions in global container shipping that has left the top six shipping lines controlling 63 percent of the market and comes at a time when the industry is experiencing a recovery after a lengthy downturn.

AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - French telecoms firms Orange (PA:ORAN) is open to discussing potential tie-ups with other operators in its home market but is not likely to be the instigator of consolidation in the sector, financial chief Ramon Fernandez said. 
An aggressive price war between French telecoms companies has revived expectations in recent months that the sector, dominated by Orange,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD) was ripe for consolidation.
Fernandez said in an interview with Reuters that Orange was in a strong position and could afford to see how other maneuvers in the sector played out. 
""There is no urgency for us for this scenario of consolidation to materialize,"" Fernandez said on the sidelines of an economic conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. 
""Our position is to say that the door is always open to potential discussions,"" he said, adding, however, that it was improbable that Orange would try to trigger those talks. 
A previous bid by Orange to buy Bouygues Telecom and forge a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed in 2016. 
It was complicated in part by a stand-off between the French government - which has a 23 percent stake in Orange - and billionaire Martin Bouygues over the clout the billionaire, and head of the Bouygues, would have gained in the merged group, according to sources at the time. 
""The previous scenario under which Orange was in the driving seat is very, very unlikely (to repeat itself),"" Fernandez said. ""That said, there's always room in a car for several passengers, so we'll have to see if at some stage we should take one of those seats.""
Other French operators have signaled they could make a move. Altice Europe's French unit SFR was approached last month by Bouygues, two sources close to the matter have told Reuters, confirming earlier reports by French newspaper Le Monde. 
Orange's Fernandez said that consolidation would have to happen at some point, across Europe as well as in France. 

""In France there's no room for four operators ... This is an industry that needs a lot of capital, you need to invest a lot to roll out next generation networks,"" he said, adding that powerful competition from the United States and Asia was also a factor.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Departing ZTE executive describes 'deep humiliation' in farewell letter,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A departing senior executive at China's ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) (HK:0763), which is fighting a crippling U.S. supplier ban, said in a letter to staff on Friday that his departure amid a Sino-US trade war was ""deeply humiliating"". 
Zhang Zhenhui was one of scores of executives at China's No.2 telecommunications equipment maker ordered to leave as part of a $1.4 billion settlement deal ZTE made with the United States in June in order to end a seven-year supplier ban.
ZTE, which relies on U.S. suppliers for core components, had to cease major operations in April after the U.S. government imposed the ban, saying the firm broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
As part of the settlement, ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, put $400 million in escrow, and hire a U.S.-appointed compliance monitor. It also agreed to replace its board, remove all members of its leadership at or above senior vice-president level along with any executives associated with the wrongdoing, within 30 days. 
Zhang, who was one of five executive vice presidents at ZTE and in charge of sales and marketing, issued a farewell letter to staff on Friday, employees said.
In the letter, which was circulated online on Saturday, Zhang recounted his 18 years at ZTE and said he had no responsibility in ZTE's compliance violations. 
""In the environment of a Sino-US trade war, in the 'white terror' of a technology war, all executive presidents including me have signed termination contracts to formally leave the company yesterday,"" Zhang said. 
A spokeswoman for ZTE declined to comment. Reuters could not immediately contact Zhang. 
ZTE was found guilty in 2016 of having sold products with U.S. technology to restricted countries including Iran, violating U.S. export rules. 
It managed to avoid a 7-year supplier ban after reaching a settlement agreement with the United States in March 2017 that included a $1.2 billion fine. The United States reinstated the ban this April after it said ZTE had failed to punish the executives involved as agreed. 
Despite a provision in the settlement agreed last month that allowed the United States to exempt certain executives, all members of ZTE's former board and former senior management team have left the company. 
Company insiders told Reuters nearly two dozen senior executives left ZTE on Friday. 
Some employees and analysts have expressed doubt over whether a new board and management team could settle in quickly enough to lead the company out of the woods even after the ban is lifted. 
In the letter, Zhang also praised long-time rival Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and said he truly wished Huawei, as a Chinese company, could ""straighten up its spine and face inevitable challenges in the future"". 

Huawei, the world's largest telecom equipment maker, has long been under scrutiny in the United States, seen as a risk because of its alleged links to the Chinese government, which the company has denied.

""Now that Trump has decided to seek Senate confirmation of a new director for the independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, English is stepping down and we intend to file court papers on Monday to bring the litigation to a close,"" English's attorney Deepak Gupta said in a tweet .
Last November English filed a lawsuit seeking to have herself acknowledged as Acting Director of the CFPB. 
English, who served as the CFPB's chief of staff, was elevated to Deputy Director by Richard Cordray, shortly before he resigned as the Director of the bureau. 
Last month the Trump administration said it would nominate Kathy Kraninger, an official from the White House Office of Management and Budget, to serve as the next director of the CFPB. 
Kraninger would succeed her current boss, the interim head of the CFPB, Mick Mulvaney, if the U.S. Senate confirms the nomination.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it settled a lawsuit against two former  ITT Educational Services Inc  (PK:ESINQ) executives accused of hiding the defunct for-profit college operator's actual financial condition from investors.
The settlements with former Chief Executive Officer Kevin Modany and former Chief Financial Officer Daniel Fitzpatrick came ahead of a trial scheduled for Monday in federal court in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The deal came after the SEC's commissioners took the rare step last year of rejecting an earlier proposed settlement negotiated between the defendants and the agency's staff.
Under Friday's settlements, both men agreed to be barred from serving as officers and directors of publicly-traded companies for five years. Modany and Fitzpatrick will also pay penalties of $200,000 and $100,000, respectively.
Modany and Fitzpatrick settled the lawsuit without admitting or denying the SEC's claims that they acted as so-called ""control persons"" for ITT's securities violations.
David Miller, Modany's lawyer, and Fredric Firestone, Fitzpatrick's lawyer, said both men were pleased to put the case behind them.
In 2015, the SEC sued Carmel, Indiana-based ITT, Modany and Fitzpatrick and accused them of fraudulently concealing from its investors potentially huge losses in two student loan programs that the for-profit college operator had guaranteed. 
The SEC said that by 2012, the loans made through those programs were performing abysmally, with high default rates.
But instead of disclosing that it expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars because its guarantee obligations had been triggered, ITT and its management took steps to make its exposure to the programs appear limited, the SEC said.
In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education banned ITT from enrolling new students who receive federal aid.
ITT subsequently announced it would shut its 137 technical college campuses in 39 states, which affected about 35,000 students. It filed for bankruptcy in September 2016.
The SEC settled its case against ITT in July 2017, after reaching agreements-in-principle two months earlier to resolve the charges against Modany and Fitzpatrick. 
But in August 2017, SEC attorneys informed the court that the agency's commissioners had rejected the proposed settlements with Modany and Fitzpatrick.
Democratic Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois and Sherrod Brown of Ohio wrote to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in June 2017 urging the SEC to permanently bar Modany from acting as an officer of a publicly traded company and to seek tough penalties against him and Fitzpatrick.

The case is SEC v. ITT Educational Services Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana, No. 15-00758.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>","Trade worries fester, even as Wall Street shrugs off latest tariffs","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street has taken the China-U.S. tariffs enacted on Friday in stride so far, but investors are on alert for a ramp-up in the trade conflict. 
Stock investors had been bracing for weeks for Washington and Beijing to place the tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods, and share prices were occasionally hurt by escalations in rhetoric along the way, with certain sectors taking a bigger hit than others as traders avoided companies seen taking the heaviest blows. 
Another round of sweeping tariffs could knock Wall Street off track. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday upped the ante on his country's largest trading partner, warning the United States may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. 
""The real question is, how long do we stay in the trade war?"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""If we got to that point (of escalation), all bets are off for any continuation of the bull market.
The S&P 500 (SPX) rose nearly 1 percent on Friday, with traders saying they had priced in the United States and China enacting tit-for-tat duties.
The S&P 500 is still up 3 percent year to date and the Nasdaq (IXIC) is up 11 percent, near record highs. 
The specter of a full-blown trade war also risks sinking China's markets deeper into bear territory. Six months of wrangling over tariffs with the United States has wiped out about a fifth of China's stock market value.
U.S. stocks have been in a bull run for nearly a decade, with the latest leg driven by a U.S. tax code overhaul that are boosting quarterly earnings. 
Investors are now laser focused on any warnings companies might give about the impact of tariffs when reporting second-quarter results over the next few weeks. 
S&P 500 companies are expected to report 21 percent growth in earnings per share for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""There may be impacts even in the second quarter, even though the tariffs haven’t gone through yet, because people’s behavior changes at the margin in anticipation of these things. It will be a read of the tea leaves,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.
SECTOR FAVORITES 
Investors have been selling out of specific sectors and stocks they believe are more at risk of being hurt by tariffs and buying others. 
Since March 1, when Trump ignited fears of a trade war by threatening steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, S&P 500 industrials (SPLRCI) have fallen 4 percent and the S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> has lost 7 percent. 
 Boeing Co  (N:BA), the largest U.S. exporter to China, is down 4 percent from early March, but has still gained 14 percent in 2018, outperforming the wider market. 
 Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), another major exporter to China, has lost 14 percent year to date.
The Russell 2000 (RUT), which tracks smaller companies widely viewed as less exposed than larger corporations to global trade, has gained 20 percent in 2018 and 3 percent just this week. But with that index already setting record highs in 2018, some investors warn further gains may be limited. 
""You can say small and mid-cap stocks are a pocket of safety but at some point they become overvalued,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU).

454,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 05:15PM ET</span>",BP in lead to acquire BHP's U.S. onshore shale assets: sources,"By David French, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -  BP  Plc (L:BP) is in the lead to acquire the U.S. onshore shale oil and gas assets of BHP Billiton Ltd (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) after submitting an offer worth well in excess of $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The move represents a big bet by BP on U.S. oil and gas production at a time when energy prices are rebounding. It would allow it to significantly rebalance its business with oil production, after focusing largely on natural gas assets. 
BP is the front-runner in the auction for the assets run by BHP, and could reach a deal in coming weeks, the sources added, cautioning that an agreement is not certain and it is possible that negotiations could end unsuccessfully.
The exact terms and composition of BP's offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BP and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
BHP said in August it aimed to sell onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom. It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so.
The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year. 
In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border. 
However, BP's expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP's focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010.
If completed, the acquisition of BHP's acreage would be transformational for BP's unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas.
Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), sources have said.

460,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Tech Stocks Win the 4-Day Week
U.S. stocks finished the week mostly higher, thanks mainly to buyers coming in on a low-volume Friday.
The S&P 500 finished the week up about 1.5% and the Dow ended about 0.8% higher for the week. The big winner was the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, which closed up about 2.4% for the week.
2. Jobs Gain With Wage Growth in Check
The economic calendar was dominated by Friday’s employment report, which showed still-solid growth in payrolls, but lower-than-expected wages, which eased inflation concerns.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 213,000 in June. That was higher than the consensus estimate of 200,000. The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 4.0% from 3.8%, missing consensus expectations for it to remain unchanged as more people entered the labor force.
Average hourly earnings advanced 0.2% month-on-month in June, below expectations for it to repeat a 0.3% gain.
The data did little to dissuade investors that the Federal Reserve will waver from its plan to gradually raise interest rates. The markets are still pricing in two more rate hikes this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor.
3. U.S, China Trade Battle Officially Underway
After all the pre-bout hype, the bell finally rang on the U.S-China trade fight Friday, guaranteeing the week’s trade tensions ended on a nervous note.
There was no last-minute change of plan as the U.S. put tariffs in place on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods at 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT). The Chinese hit right back with tariffs on $34 billion on U.S. goods going into effect.
China said the U.S. had “launched the largest trade war in economic history to date.”
And the U.S. administration is already looking at ramping up the amount of tariffed goods.
“You have another 16 (billion dollars) in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200 billion in abeyance and then after the $200 billion, we have $300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,” President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, according to Reuters.
This erased a lot of the good feeling after a U.S. official said the country would be willing to drop threats of tariffs on EU autos if the bloc would drop its duties on U.S. vehicles.
4. Greenback Struggles as Euro Bounces Back
The U.S. dollar endured a tough week that was not helped by the mixed jobs numbers that offered little encouragement for traders looking for faster Fed hikes.The dollar index, which compares the greenback to a basket of six currencies, was down about 0.7% for the week.
The dollar also faced pressure from the euro during the week. German Chancellor Angela Merkel resolved an immigration battle and with her interior minister that had threatened the future of her coalition government.
Signs that auto trade tariff battles with the U.S weren’t a fait accompli and strong German factory orders also helped the single currency.
The dollar index fell around 0.5% on Friday.
5. Elon Musk Controversy Overshadows Tesla Production
In a holiday-shortened week, with many investors taking a summer break, there was little company news to move the markets. But one of Wall Street’s most-discussed companies stayed in the spotlight.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) started the week on what should have been an encouraging note. It announced it had hit its target production pace of 5,000 Model 3s per week, just shortly after its June 30 deadline. Tesla also reported a 55% increase in production during the second quarter.
But after a sharp before-hours spike Monday, the shares ended the day lower as sellers took control.
And focus later turned from company performance to allegations by CEO Elon Musk of journalistic misconduct. Musk questioned on Twitter whether Business Insider journalist Linette Lopez was colluding with short seller Jim Chanos and bribing a Tesla employee.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Weinstein Co sales price increased by $2 million in push to close deal,"By Jim Christie
(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co, its buyer and creditors on Friday said they reached a deal to increase the bankrupt film studio's sales price by $2 million, to $289 million, to ensure the deal goes through.
Robert Del Genio, a senior managing director of business advisory firm FTI Consulting who is serving as Weinstein Co's chief restructuring officer, said in statement that the agreement ""clears the path for this sale to close.""
The deal follows a bid last month by the Weinstein Co to cut its sales price to $287 million to settle disputes that broke out after it announced a plan in May to sell its library, television shows and unreleased movies to Lantern Capital Partners for $310 million.
Weinstein Co said it needed to cut the sales price to close the transaction because it was nearly out of cash and financing deadlines for the sale were approaching fast.
Weinstein Co had won bankruptcy court approval for the $310 million sale, but before it could close disputes broke out over so-called cure amounts the studio would have to pay to exit or transfer certain contracts.
Lantern also charged the studio breached representations and warranties in their asset purchase agreement.
Ahead of a June 22 conference on the sale, the two companies reached a deal to cut $23 million from the sales price to settle all disputes over cure amounts and cease fighting over details of the asset purchase agreement in order to close the sale.
Under the new deal announced on Friday, Lantern Capital agreed to make numerous cure payments for contracts it is assuming in the sale to resolve concerns of unsecured creditors.
A hearing where the Weinstein Co will argue for an order approving its new sales price has been scheduled for July 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.
The studio sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March after several months of looking for a buyer amid a scandal that rocked the entertainment industry stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against co-founder Harvey Weinstein.
The one-time Hollywood kingpin has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone.
The case is The Weinstein Co Holdings LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 18-10601.

""As an airline, you always have to be flexible, you have to be fluid in what you are doing,"" Hubert Frach, a divisional senior vice president for Emirates, said on the sidelines of an event in Chile's capital.
""If one market is showing some weaknesses, you either work harder and you try to find new market segments, or mid-term or long-term you will allocate your fleet and you change the shape of your network.""
Frach was visiting the South American country for the inauguration of a new route that connects Santiago and Dubai, via Sao Paolo. 
Emirates, which has dozens of flights connecting cities in China with destinations in the West, will compete on the Santiago to Sao Paolo route - one of the most popular in South America - mainly with regional giant LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) and Colombia's Avianca (CN:AVT_p).

467,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Investors to tune in for trade impact this profit season,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the United States and China finally formalizing tit-for-tat import tariffs, Wall Street is gearing up to dissect U.S. corporate earnings in the coming weeks for signs of a trade war impact and whether it will affect spending plans.
Investors worry the trade conflict with China, the United States' largest trading partner, could make companies delay plans for capital expenditures, which jumped in the first quarter after the late December U.S. tax overhaul that included massive tax cuts for corporations.
The United States and China slapped duties on $34 billion worth of each others' imports on Friday, escalating their conflict and suggesting there was little sign the dispute will soon end.
Machinery, aerospace and other industrial names have been among the hardest hit. S&P 500 industrials (SPLRCI) have fallen more than 5 percent since March 1, when U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, while the S&P 500 (SPX) has risen more than 1 percent in that period.
Following the tax package approval, expectations were high that companies would ramp up not just buybacks and dividends but capital spending in 2018, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
""What we're hearing from a number of CFOs is if the trade issue continues to dominate the headlines and create even more uncertainty, those plans may be on hold,"" she said.
In the first quarter, year-over-year S&P 500 capital expenditure growth was the highest since 2011, according to S&P Dow Jones data. 
Strategists at DataTrek Research in New York said in a recent note the ""primary planning headache"" for corporate managers in the second half of the year will come from uncertainty related to trade and tariffs.
""The major concern is the supply chain. So many little parts for almost everything are manufactured in China, and there can be a real hold-up in manufacturing because of these tariffs... It is all a balancing act,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, in New York. ""For every company hurt, there's a company that's being helped. So this isn't negative for everyone by any means.""
Reporting on the second quarter kicks into gear next week, with results Friday from JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  (N:C). More than 200 S&P 500 reports are due the following two weeks, including from some U.S. companies that could be caught in the middle of a U.S. trade war with China. 
They are expected to include results from Honeywell (N:HON), Boeing (N:BA), Whirlpool (N:WHR) and  Western Digital  (O:WDC), while results from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) are due July 30.
Profit forecasts that include a potential tariff impact will perhaps even overshadow second-quarter earnings growth, which analysts say could equal or surpass the first-quarter's 26.6 percent year-over-year increase. That was the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""That dominates the landscape at the moment. The impact isn't going to be on earnings already made; it could though impact the accompanying guidance to the extent management offers any,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Though consumer discretionary shares have been among the best performers this year, UBS analysts said import tariffs could be a worry for the retail industry.
Harley Davidson (N:HOG) drew attention in June when it warned of a financial toll from trade tensions, and the trade dispute in general has created uncertainty for investors struggling to value stocks at a time strong corporate profits might otherwise help carry the bull market through its 10th year.
Some investors say much of the negative news has already been priced into the market, suggesting stocks could gain as earnings are reported.
""The earnings season has the potential to draw more money into the market,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
Savings from the U.S. tax overhaul are continuing to boost corporate bottom lines, he said. 
The tariff impact has yet to show up in earnings forecasts, even though trade tensions were a worry heading into first-quarter results as well. 
Estimates for S&P 500 second-quarter profit growth actually have risen slightly since April, putting the latest forecast at around 20.7 percent, based on Thomson Reuters data. Given that the majority of companies typically beat analysts' earnings expectations, that number is likely to rise.
But other risks to earnings are mounting as well, including rising interest rates and a strengthening U.S. dollar, which strategists say could be more of a problem in the second half of the year if it continues on the same path. 

Higher commodity and labor costs are on the list of profit worries as well.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 03:21PM ET</span>",Wall Street buoyed by U.S. jobs growth despite tariffs,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose to their highest levels in two weeks on Friday as strong U.S. jobs growth blunted the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade dispute.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 213,000 jobs last month, the U.S. Labor Department said, topping expectations of 195,000, while the unemployment rate rose from an 18-year low to 4 percent and average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent. The moderate wage growth allayed fears of a strong build-up in inflation pressures.
The positive news from the U.S. employment report offset, at least for the moment, heightened trade tensions between the United States and China. The two countries slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's imports on Friday. Beijing accused the White House of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war.""
U.S. stock futures traded downward on Friday morning after the tariffs went into effect but reversed course after the release of the jobs report. By the market open, stocks were rising.
""The market turned its frown upside down, and it's been in the green ever since,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""This really is the best outcome we could have hoped for, more jobs without a whole lot of wage pressures.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 133.24 points, or 0.55 percent, to 24,489.98, the S&P 500 gained 25.88 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,762.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 101.94 points, or 1.34 percent, to 7,688.37.
All of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors posted gains.
Although U.S. stocks appeared minimally affected by U.S. and Chinese tariffs going into effect, some investors warned that prolonged trade tensions could roil the markets, as they have on several occasions this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump also warned the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year.
""You're going to get some stalling of the market, should trade issues begin to accelerate,"" said Gerry Sparrow, a portfolio manager for Interactive Brokers Asset Management, a Boston-based online investing company.
Shares of Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc rose 19.2 percent and were on track for their biggest percentage gain in more than 14 years after the company and Japanese drugmaker Eisai Co said their Alzheimer's drug showed promise in a mid-stage trial. Biogen added the most gains to the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 healthcare index rose 1.5 percent, the greatest percentage gain among the S&P's major sectors, while the Nasdaq biotech index jumped 3.6 percent.
Besides Biogen, technology heavyweights Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) provided the biggest boost to the markets. The S&P technology index rose 1.3 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 117 new highs and 17 new lows.

469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Mexico Stocks Rally as Capital Returns Post-AMLO Election,"(Bloomberg) -- Money is pouring into Mexico, prompting hard-hit stocks to rally.
Mexican assets had been under pressure in the run-up to Sunday’s presidential election. They’ve been rebounding as President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, sought to ease investors’ concerns after he won more than half the vote.
Among the stocks that most benefited are those that saw sharp drops earlier in the year and look attractive for returning funds, Actinver SA analyst Enrique Mendoza said.
Low-cost airline Controladora Vuela Cia de Aviacion, or Volaris, saw shares fall the most in April since 2016 -- they are now up 15 percent over the past five days. Micro lender Gentera SAB, which in March fell to a five-year low, rose 12 percent this week.  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Mexico SA and Grupo Lala SAB increased 9.5 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.
“Capital is returning to the stock exchange and it’s picking names that had been too castigated,” Mendoza said in an interview. “Gentera had been crashing and stabilized in the past few months, making for a very low valuation.”
Earlier in the week, Mexican stocks were raised to overweight at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) from equal-weight as they look attractive in absolute and relative terms. The Mexican economy continues to expand at a moderate pace and the outlook for corporate earnings growth in 2018-2019 remains strong, analysts wrote in a note.
Volaris has also benefited from signs of strong demand. The company reported a 14 percent year-over-year increase in passenger traffic in June.
The S&P BMV/ICP benchmark index has gained 3 percent this week. It now trades at 15.9 times 12-month forward price-to-earnings, versus an average of 17.8 times for the last five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

495,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",BMW and Mercedes SUVs to Roam Free If U.S.-EU Tariffs Drop to 0%,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s one big problem with the gambit the U.S. ambassador to Germany has floated as a way to resolve one of Donald Trump’s biggest trade bugaboos: Chevys and Fords aren’t going to flood Europe’s shores anytime soon, regardless of how low tariffs go.
The prospect of the U.S. and European Union pursuing a bilateral elimination of car tariffs sent German automaker shares soaring this week. It’s easy to see why when considering the sales ranks on both sides of the Atlantic: BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG’s (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz models dominate among those vehicles that are shipped back and forth.
Five of the top six vehicles that’ll be shipped from U.S. auto plants and bought by buyers in EU countries this year will be German models, including South Carolina-built BMW X3 sport utility vehicles and Alabama-assembled Mercedes GLE SUVs, according to LMC Automotive.
American-made models from the Detroit Three -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) -- are expected to remain rare sights on European roads. The best-selling U.S.-assembled car this year by an American company will probably be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s Model S sedan, according to LMC’s projections.
Detroit’s Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler does lay claim to one of the top-selling imports to the U.S. from the EU: the Jeep Renegade SUV. But this list, too, is dominated by BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG. Nine of the 15 top-selling vehicles in the U.S. imported from the EU this year will roll off the companies’ German assembly lines, LMC predicts.
This may turn out to be a fly in the ointment for Trump, who last month threatened a 20 percent tariff on EU-imported autos. The U.S. charges tariffs of 2.5 percent on cars and 25 percent on pickups and delivery vans, while the EU’s levies are at 10 percent.
The U.S. president has said zero tariffs are indeed the end game he’s pursuing, although he’s described a big catch to that being a workable solution: companies are going to have to build more of their cars in America.
“What’s going to really happen is, there’s going to be no tax,” Trump told Fox News on Sunday. “You know why? They’re going to build their cars in America. They’re going to make them here.”
Investors who are optimistic that tariffs can be avoided “need to be very careful,” Max Warburton, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. If they’re wrong and levies are implemented, they’ll hit European automakers’ earnings hard.
“It’s clear that the Germans will need to move to reorganize, disperse and localize production,” he said.

Li's message, in an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine, comes ahead of an intergovernmental summit in Berlin next week, when German manufacturers' concerns about loss of technological leadership to China are likely to be high on the agenda.
The manufacturing and exporting powerhouses are allies as well as rivals, since both stand to lose from the looming trade war being pushed by the U.S. President Donald Trump.
But European officials are concerned at flush Chinese companies' acquisitions in Europe, fearing that Europe's know-how and technology advantage is being lost. Both Brussels and Berlin have proposed new instruments for blocking Chinese acquisitions in strategic sectors.
""(I hope) Germany changes its mind and creates a fair, open environment and a stable institutional framework for companies that invest in Germany or Europe,"" Li wrote in the opinion piece.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has stated she wants Europe to play a more interventionist role in preserving and strengthening strategic sectors such as semiconductors, battery technology or artificial intelligence, to avoid a loss of know-how that could damage local industries.
But Li said Europe was wrong to fear that Chinese investments would lead to European companies suffering a loss of expertise or technological advantage.

German companies should not be afraid of cooperating with Chinese companies, he wrote, since China protected intellectual property and ""does not force foreign companies into technology transfer.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor’s (N:F) China slump intensified, with vehicle sales tumbling 38 percent in June and the automaker recording its worst-ever first half, as buyers shunned its aging models that are awaiting overhauls and flocked to rivals.
The U.S. automaker announced on Friday it sold 62,057 vehicles in China in June, taking its sales for the first half of the year to 400,443, down 25 percent compared with the year-ago period. According to consultancy LMC Automotive, it was Ford's biggest first-half percentage decline since starting operations in China in 2001.
Ford, which undertook a big expansion in China earlier this decade, is paying the price for a lack of new models in its lineup. Last year, its sales fell 6 percent even as overall vehicle sales in China rose 3 percent.
“We always knew it would be a challenging year for us given our position in the product cycle,” Peter Fleet, head of Ford’s Asia-Pacific operations, which include China, said in a statement.
Fleet has previously said Ford's sales will not likely regain momentum in China, the world's biggest auto market, until next year when the first of new vehicle models arrive in showrooms in large enough numbers.
LMC Automotive senior market analyst Alan Kang said one reason Ford is struggling in China is ""fiercer competition"" in the car market there, where luxury brands are suffering amid the rise of local Chinese brands. 
""Weak global brands are squeezed like the meat in a sandwich, so this is why we can see not only Ford,"" but  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380),  KIA Motors  Corp (KS:000270), and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) have ""all suffered"" in the last two years, Kang said. 
The dim sales numbers come as the United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other's imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war"" ever in a sharp escalation of their months-long conflict.
With automobiles subject to additional duties by China, Ford has much to lose. Last year, it shipped about 80,000 vehicles to China from North America, more than half of them its upper-end Lincolns – including the Lincoln Continental sedan and the Lincoln MKX crossover SUV.
Ford said a day before it will not hike prices of imported Ford and Lincoln models in China, thus absorbing the additional cost of tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.
Ford’s troubles in China, which include the absence of a country head following the abrupt departure of the previous chief in January after only five months at the helm, contrast with General Motors Co's (N:GM) steady performance there. Ford's Fleet has been overseeing the company's China operations, as it searches for a new country chief.
GM sold 4.04 million vehicles in China last year, up 4.4 percent from a year earlier. Ford, in comparison, sold 1.19 million cars last year, down 6 percent. Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) also outsold Ford last year in China.
In an effort to reverse the slump, Ford has said it is overhauling its product lineup for China. Redesigned Focus compact and Escort subcompact cars are due to hit showrooms in China later this year, along with the new Lincoln MKC and Nautilus sport utility vehicles.
In June, sales of Ford’s premium Lincoln brand rose 12 percent to 4,350 vehicles, with sales volume for the first half totaling 24,314 vehicles, up 4 percent from a year earlier.

Still other brands remained under pressure. Particularly poor performing was the Ford brand, whose sales collapsed.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies could be trouble for a number of American automotive and technology companies using Chinese funds to develop electric and self-driving cars and related services, from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) to dozens of Silicon Valley startups.
Chinese companies in the past five years have funded at least 80 U.S. transportation startups, with a combined valuation of more than $100 billion, while also pouring billions into established firms such as Tesla, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available data.
(GRAPHIC: Intertwined investments - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KNBzoP)
Likewise, U.S. corporations and private investors have funded at least 60 Chinese startups — 16 of them so-called unicorns, valued at $1 billion or more — often co-investing with their counterparts in China.
Many of those investments are focused specifically on two key areas of future transportation: electric vehicles and automated vehicles. These are keystones of Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, one of several government policies driving Chinese tech investments overseas. Electric and self-driving vehicles also are expected to underpin the next wave of global transportation and services in the 2020s.
For now, U.S. lawmakers and Trump appear to be focused on the money flowing into the United States from China, while expressing concern about advanced technology flowing back to China from the United States. 
Last week, John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council, responded to those concerns, urging both governments to ""step back"" from threats and instead continue discussions to improve intellectual property protections and market access for American companies in China and avoid “sanctions that would harm families and jobs in each country.”
“We need to ensure that we have the right balance between our national security and economic interests,” Frisbie said in a statement issued by his business council. 
More than 20 Chinese companies — including internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700),  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), as well as state-owned SAIC, China’s largest automaker — have offices in California’s Silicon Valley and have funded a broad spectrum of U.S. tech startups focused mainly on electric and self-driving vehicles.
U.S. automotive companies, among them General Motors Co (N:GM), have invested in Chinese transportation startups.
Critical backing also has been provided by U.S. venture firms, notably Silicon Valley stalwart Sequoia Capital, which has seeded at least 20 Chinese startups in the transportation sector, often co-investing with one or more Chinese partners.
In the transport sector, Chinese investors have ties to some of the U.S. auto and automotive technology industry's biggest names.
Tencent, whose $460 billion market cap dwarfs that of the entire U.S. auto industry, has invested an undisclosed amount in Silicon Valley startup Zoox, which is developing self-driving vehicles for commercial ride-service fleets and is valued at $3.5 billion.
Tencent also is one of the largest investors in Tesla after it acquired a 5 percent stake last year for $1.8 billion. It is unclear if and how Tencent might help Tesla blunt the impact of retaliatory moves by China if the United States blocks further Chinese investment in Silicon Valley.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is one of more than 50 development partners in Baidu’s Project Apollo self-driving platform, along with U.S. tech companies  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), as well as Silicon Valley self-driving startups JingChi and PlusAI.
Ford and Baidu both have invested in Silicon Valley startup Velodyne, a manufacturer of lidar sensors for self-driving cars, and said they intend to jointly develop artificial intelligence and smart connectivity in cars.
Santa Clara-based Nvidia, one of the most important chipmakers in the United States, provides high-speed processors to Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba and has co-invested with China’s Qiming Venture Partners in Silicon Valley-based JingChi, as well as in Chinese self-driving startup TuSimple.

Two of the most valuable transportation startups — U.S. ride services leader Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and its Chinese counterpart Didi Chuxing — have cross shareholdings in each other, and each is backed by a long list of both Chinese and U.S. investors.

DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) will take its time to find a new boss after accepting Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger's resignation, a move which clears the way for a radical restructuring of the German industrial group.
The board did not appoint an interim CEO but said it had asked the remaining executives - Guido Kerkhoff, Oliver Burkhard and Donatus Kaufmann - to lead the company for now.
""In this difficult situation it is most important now for the company to remain on course,"" the supervisory board's Chairman Ulrich Lehner said in a statement.
Hiesinger's offer to resign, announced late on Thursday, came less than a week after he sealed a landmark joint venture deal with India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), the culmination of two years of negotiations that in the end came too late to placate investors hungry for change.
His departure creates a power vacuum as Thyssenkrupp prepares to present a revamped strategy for the group, which was forged by the merger of two German steel groups founded in the 19th century and currently spans submarines, elevators and car parts. 
""I have not taken this decision lightly - quite the opposite,"" Hiesinger wrote in a letter to staff. ""I take this step very consciously to enable a fundamental discussion in the supervisory board on the future of Thyssenkrupp."" 
Hiesinger had been due to present a new strategy for the group to the board next week, which analysts said would now likely be delayed until a new CEO is found.
""The succession to Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger as Chief Executive will follow in a structured process,"" Thyssenkrupp said, without providing details on possible candidates or a timeline.
Activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott have both criticized Thyssenkrupp's performance under Hiesinger, with shares down 28 percent since he took office in January 2011.
On Friday, the stock jumped as much as 6.6 percent to the top of the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 index (STOXX) before giving up some of its gains to trade 0.8 percent higher by 1312 GMT.

509,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 08:46AM ET</span>",Airbus CEO steps up warning on danger of hard Brexit,"By Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Airbus (PA:AIR) warned the British government on Friday that in a worst-case scenario Brexit could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. 
Companies have become increasingly vocal about the risks of Brexit, hoping to have an impact on the outcome of crunch talks between British Prime Minister Theresa May and her senior ministers on Friday. 
For companies, the biggest worry is that Britain leaves the bloc without a deal, a so-called ""hard"" Brexit.
""The certification for thousands of parts that are today part of the supply chain, part of our aircraft, would fall apart, and that could be a very troubling situation for us and could eventually lead to a standstill of production,"" Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said, contemplating the worst-case scenario. 
For Airbus, which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, that worst-case scenario would occur if Britain is no longer part of the EU aviation safety certification agency, EASA, which gives planes and parts approvals so that they can fly.
Guillaume Faury, boss of Airbus's planemaking unit, said planes could also be grounded.
""In case there is no agreement, we will not be allowed to install parts and make them fly on airplanes so there will be aircraft grounded,"" he said at Airbus's annual media briefing in London. 
FRACTIOUS CABINET 
PM May hopes to settle differences in her fractious cabinet about Brexit at the meeting at her country residence Chequers, enabling her to unblock stalled talks with the European Union.
Those talks follow a step-up in warnings from various companies in recent weeks. 
Airbus last month issued its strongest warning yet over Brexit, saying that withdrawal without a deal would force it to reconsider its long-term position and put thousands of British jobs at risk.
Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover joined in on Wednesday, saying that a chaotic Brexit would cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing operations in the United Kingdom. The retail industry said a ""no deal"" might see ""food rotting at ports"".
Enders did not seem hopeful that the British government will make progress, saying earlier that it has ""no clue or at least (no) consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm"".
He defended Airbus's decision to issue the warnings.
""We will, of course, speak up. We do this because this is what we owe our shareholders,"" German-born Enders said. 
Asked to provide examples of the steps being taken to soften the impact of Brexit, Airbus's Faury said the company was looking at installing a three-month buffer of parts in some factories.
But in order to reach this level in the nine months remaining before Britain leaves the European Union, suppliers would have to abruptly raise production by one third - whereas most of suppliers were already at full capacity, he said.
Airbus is building warehouses to store the extra parts, an industry source added.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 07:51AM ET</span>",Airbus upbeat on prospect for A400M export contract this year,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Friday it was optimistic it could sign a first export contract for its troubled multi-nation A400M military transport plane this year, and expressed growing confidence about prospects for European defense cooperation.
Airbus Defence and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke said the company had been in negotiations with a potential buyer for the A400M airlifter, but did not name the country.
""We are pretty optimistic that there will be a first signature of a contract for the A400M for export still this year,"" Hoke told an Airbus media day in London that was webcast. 
Airbus says the A400M - built by Airbus for seven NATO buyers - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - is finally turning the corner after years of cost overruns, technical challenges and schedule delays.
Hoke said Airbus expected to demonstrate by the end of the year the plane's ability to refuel helicopters in mid-air, one of several features whose delivery has been delayed.
The A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military and humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (N:BA) C-17.
Hoke said Airbus also expected to complete revamped delivery deals with individual buyers this year following a declaration of intent signed in February.
Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the company saw rising defense demand in Europe, where military budgets are now expanding after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, and given pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The freefall that we had ... until fairly recently has been stopped, thanks to Mr. Putin and also thanks a little bit to Mr. Trump,"" he said, citing ""significant"" new projects both in the short and long-term.
Hoke also highlighted fresh momentum in efforts to bring together the highly fragmented European defense market, and credited French President Emmanuel Macron for helping push forward a European drone program and a Franco-German future fighter project.
Hoke said the fighter jet program would start with two lead nations, but other nations - including Spain and Britain - could be invited to join in later. The move reflected lessons learned on the A400M program, which experts say was burdened by over-ambitious wish lists from participating nations.
Europe needed to focus its efforts on one fighter project to remain competitive globally, Hoke said. ""We cannot survive global competition if we fragment this market ... further,"" he said.
Airbus and its long-time rival, France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), signed an agreement to work together on the project in April, a deal that Hoke said many never expected to happen.
""It was a turning point. It showed that we can cooperate and make things happen,"" he said.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Trump's $500 billion trade threat makes China's already battered investors shiver,"By Samuel Shen and Vidya Ranganathan
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Six months of wrangling over trade tariffs with the United States has wiped out about a fifth of China's stock market value and driven its currency down sharply. But those moves may have just been a downpayment on what is yet to come.
Shanghai's benchmark share index (SSEC) is down roughly 22 percent since January, when U.S. President Donald Trump's first trade tariffs on solar panels were announced. It has fallen 9 percent since June 19, when Trump outlined his plans to tax a lot more Chinese imports than he initially proposed.
Tariffs on the first batch of $34 billion worth of Chinese imports kicked in on Friday. Beijing said it had no choice but to respond in kind by taxing a similar amount of U.S. goods coming into China. U.S. tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods are due to go into effect in two weeks, Trump said on Thursday. 
But Trump also raised the temperature much further by telling reporters that after the initial $50 billion of goods has been targeted with tariffs, Washington could add another $500 billion. 
With Beijing indicating it will respond with tariffs on more U.S. imports or other corresponding actions of its own, the specter of a full-blown trade war risks sinking China's markets deeper into bear territory.
Initial market estimates of the impact of tit-for-tat Chinese and U.S. tariffs have been modest. A China central bank adviser, Ma Jun, said U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods will shave 0.2 percentage points off Chinese growth. 
Market economists reckoned that every $100 billion of imports affected by tariffs would take away around 0.5 percent of global trade. And they have assumed a direct impact on China's economic growth in 2018 of 0.1-0.3 percentage points, and a somewhat lower effect on U.S. growth. 
But the massive scale of Trump's suggested new U.S. tariffs - 10 times the initial $50 billion - would blow any such modest predictions out of the water.
""The bigger the size (of imports facing tariffs), the bigger the potential that the GDP impact is larger than a linear extrapolation would suggest,"" said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong.
There were other secondary effects on confidence, investment and global supply chains to be considered, besides the impact on the economy through financial markets, wealth effects and corporate funding, he said.
""The risk is we underestimate the impact based on these simple back-of-the-envelope calculations.""
BOTTOMLESS
Given the uncertainty over the trade dispute, securities analysts in China suggest investors should just sell shares and hold onto cash.
""The bottom for A-shares is nowhere in sight,"" said Samuel Chien, partner of Shanghai BoomTrend Investment Management Co.
""Whether you look at fundamental factors, or market psychology, there's nothing bright - a Sino-U.S. trade war will have a seriously negative impact on China's economy,"" Chien said.
He said he fears the Shanghai index, now trading at 2,747 points, could shed another quarter of its value to get as low as 2,000 in the next 6 to 12 months. 
The yuan currency  has stabilized around 6.65 per dollar this week after Chinese state banks intervened to defend it at 11-month lows. It has dropped nearly 7 percent since April.
(GRAPHIC: Trade tensions in China's stock, currency markets - https://reut.rs/2KTfIcH)
While U.S. stock markets have been more stable than China's during these past months of escalating trade tensions, analysts warn against discounting Beijing's capacity to retaliate.
China has taken a softer, conciliatory approach so far, but investors only need to hark back to last year when South Korean companies bore the brunt of a backlash from China over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. missile system. 
The companies lost billions of dollars in market value after a Chinese boycott of Korean goods, group tours to South Korea, and the targeting of one conglomerate in particular, Lotte Group, for various regulatory inspections at its stores in China. Lotte had swapped some land with the South Korean government to enable the missile system's deployment. 
The analysts say that Beijing could suddenly make it very difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China, whether it be getting contracts, licenses or regulatory approvals. If patriotic Chinese consumers were also unleashed, damaging boycotts of American goods could follow.
Perhaps the most threatening thing Beijing could do would be to unload some of its massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries - it is currently the biggest foreign owner. 
""China’s big stick is the bond market,"" said Stephen Innes, head of APAC trading at OANDA in Singapore. He said that Beijing would use that strategy ""if it is necessary.""
Such action would likely send Treasury yields significantly higher and raise U.S. government borrowing costs. It would also hurt China's remaining holdings of the securities, which is one reason it would probably only be used as a last resort.
BEAR TERRITORY
In the meantime, technical indicators, from margin lending for shares to the prices of stock index futures, already point to a deeper slump in China's stock markets.
The SSE50 Index (SSE50) which tracks blue-chip shares hit a 13-month low on Thursday and has slumped roughly 12 percent in the past two weeks. 
In a sign market bulls are throwing in the towel, the outstanding value of margin financing - the money investors borrow to buy shares - has rapidly shrunk.  
Roughly 70 billion yuan ($10.55 billion) worth of leveraged bets were unwound over the past month alone, representing 7 percent of the total bets.
On the other hand, the outstanding value of shares investors have borrowed to sell has jumped 45 percent this year to 6.5 billion yuan, despite several restrictions placed on such direct short-selling. 
Foreign investors are turning bearish on China stocks, too. Nearly uninterrupted foreign inflows into Chinese stocks this year, spurred by optimism around MSCI Inc's inclusion of A-shares in its indexes on June 1, have reversed course since mid-June.
""Even if the market is technically oversold, sentiment is low and valuations are lower, it is still too early to catch falling knives, as there will be further selling for structural liquidity reasons from anywhere,"" said Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International. 
""At times like these, technical rebounds will be fleeting.""

518,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Credit Suisse creates new anti-sexual harassment role,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has carved out a new role to lead its handling of sexual harassment claims and examine group-wide policies, as Switzerland's second-biggest bank seeks to boost equal opportunities and create a fair treatment environment.
The appointment of Antoinette Poschung to the new role of Conduct and Ethics Ombudswoman comes after Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam tasked the bank's conduct and ethics board to review the bank's handling of sexual harassment complaints. 
In particular, Thiam in March vowed a ""thorough review"" of the bank's handling of a former employee's sexual harassment case, related to a 2010 incident the woman said had been mishandled under previous management.
That case will be further reviewed by Poschung.
""A few months ago, I had asked Lara Warner, Peter Goerke and Romeo Cerutti to review our global approach to the handling of claims of sexual harassment at Credit Suisse,"" Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in an internal memo seen by Reuters, referring to the co-chairs of the bank's conduct and ethics board and its general counsel.
""Having concluded their review, they have made clear recommendations which we will be implementing with immediate effect.""
The initiative comes as the financial industry seeks to boost workforce diversity under growing awareness of adverse conditions that have held back women and minorities, and as more women step forward with accounts of misconduct.
Most banks do not have a dedicated person dealing with sexual harassment claims but deal with them through their human resources departments or confidential internal hotlines. 
Banks such as UBS and Citi have senior roles and teams responsible for broader issues related to diversity and inclusion.
Poschung, currently Head of HR for Corporate Functions, will be responsible for reviewing all sexual harassment claims as well as conducting a bank-wide review of training practices and global policies.
""Her role is to serve as a point of immediate escalation when sexual harassment claims arise and to ensure there is appropriate senior management awareness of and attention to such claims,"" Thiam said in the note.
""From now on, all cases of this nature will be managed and heard at the Global Conduct and Ethics Board before any final decisions are made,"" Thiam said in the note. ""Our goal is to ensure fair and consistent treatment of all employees across all our geographies and activities.

The European aerospace group has faced a backlog of up to 100 A320neo jets nicknamed 'gliders' - sitting on the ground outside factories without their engines - due to delays in deliveries mainly from U.S.-based Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).

Airbus has not yet taken any decision on whether to increase output of single-aisle to 70 a month early next decade, with its engine makers not yet ready to make the jump, Faury said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks rose and the euro climbed to a three-week peak as the imposition of tariffs by the United States and China on billions of dollars of trade was absorbed calmly by markets on Friday, though concerns about the conflict escalating capped appetite for risk. 
World stocks rose 0.2 percent to their highest level in a week while Asian stocks climbed nearly half a percent led by a rebound in Chinese shares.
MSCI's main European Index edged a quarter of a percent higher and held below a two-week peak partly on cautious hopes of a rapprochement between the United States and Europe on auto trade tariffs.
U.S. equities looked set for a more cautious start, however, with stock futures down 0.2 percent. Investors are looking at monthly U.S. jobs data after U.S. Federal Reserve minutes released overnight showed policymakers expressing concerns about the economy.
Signs of nervousness about the trade outlook were also evident elsewhere in global markets with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc firm against the dollar while core U.S. and German bonds in demand. 
""Trade war concerns have shot up to the top of our concerns for investors,"" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute in London.
""We have to be aware that we are only one tweet away from much broader tariffs becoming a reality,"" she said, adding that investors were trimming back broad exposure to riskier assets. 
Latest flows data confirm that trend. Investors have pulled money out of emerging markets and European equities faster than in 2016 over the last two months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday in a weekly note.
The United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion worth of the other's imports on Friday, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war"" as the world's two biggest economies sharply escalated their conflict. 
MORE UNCERTAINTY, LESS VOLATILITY
But despite the threat of more tariffs, global markets remained broadly sanguine with gauges of market volatility in equities and currencies edging lower this week.
For example, implied volatility, a measure of expected market swings on the euro/dollar, has fallen to a one-month low this week while a market gauge on U.S. equities has edged lower.
""What can definitively be said that we are entering a period of much greater uncertainty than before though this low volatility in markets is baffling,"" said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London.
In currency markets, the euro took cues from broadly firmer stocks and rose 0.1 percent on the day to a fresh three-week high at $1.1727 with broadly strong German industrial data also helping.
The Chinese yuan weakened after choppy trade, keeping some distance from 11-month lows touched earlier this week while the dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies with U.S. jobs data later ahead eyed. 
The U.S. Labor Department is expected to report non-farm payrolls grew by 195,000 in June after surging by 223,000 in May. Monthly average hourly earnings probably rose 0.3 percent, taking the annual increase to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in May.
""Any misses in today’s data could spur a wave of profit-taking - given signs that the USD rally looks to be running out of steam,"" said analysts at ING.
U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, an amount that roughly matches its total imports from China last year.
Copper, seen as a barometer of the world's economic strength because of its wide industrial use, on Friday fell to near a one-year low, at $6,221.50 per ton, before recouping some losses.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.553 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.561 percent.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","German government, JPMorgan deny report on Deutsche Bank","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government dismissed a report that it had privately raised concerns about  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), while JPMorgan (N:JPM) denied it was interested in a stake in Germany's biggest lender.
Shares in Deutsche had jumped by as much as 6 percent on Friday after WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo) magazine said JPMorgan and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (SS:601398) might invest in the bank.
By 1055 GMT, its shares had retraced some of those gains but were still up 4.8 percent at 9.98 euros . 
The weekly publication had also said Chancellor Angela Merkel met Axel Weber, the former Bundesbank head who is now chairman of Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG), to sound out his views on Deutsche.
""We were astonished to learn about the report about a supposed conversation between the chancellor and Mr Weber,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. ""It is purely speculative and cannot be confirmed.""
The government had full trust in the bank's management, he added. 
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said: ""We are denying the story, it is not true.""
UBS and Deutsche Bank declined to comment and ICBC could not immediately be reached for comment.
Shares in Germany's flagship bank touched record lows below 9 euros in June on investor scepticism about the appointment of Christian Sewing as CEO and his strategy to refocus on its European core while slashing global investment banking.
Some investors have said they doubt whether Sewing, 48, can return Deutsche to profitability after the bank racked up three years of losses under his predecessor, John Cryan. 
He has been hobbled by downgrades to Deutsche's credit ratings, while the bank's U.S. subsidiary has failed a Federal Reserve test of its ability to withstand a financial crisis.
Despite Deutsche's woes, its franchise was attracting interest as London's standing as a financial center is threatened by Britain's looming exit from the European Union, investment bankers told WirtschaftsWoche.
Bulge-bracket banks are looking to strengthen their presence in Frankfurt, as the German financial capital and seat of the European Central Bank gains importance after Brexit.
Deutsche's shares have fallen by nearly two fifths this year, reducing its market capitalization to below 20 billion euros ($23.4 billion). That compares to JPMorgan's $353 billion and ICBC's $274 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) suffered its biggest daily share price drop a year ago after a key cancer drug trial failed amid feverish speculation the chief executive might quit.
Yet today two-thirds of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters recommend the stock, making it one of the sector's biggest consensus buys, and CEO Pascal Soriot says he is ""absolutely"" happy to carry on into the 2020s as he chases early use of modern cancer drugs.
""I don't have any plans to retire anytime soon,"" he told Reuters.
Soriot and his team are increasingly confident that while AstraZeneca may have lost one part of the battle for cancer market dominance, it can still win elsewhere by targeting tumors before they have spread around the body.
That is the second element of a twin-track strategy to differentiate AstraZeneca in the hot area of immune system-boosting drugs, which has seen rivals - led by Merck & Co (N:MRK) - leap ahead in late-stage or metastatic disease.
The idea that immunotherapy may actually work best in less sick patients is logical, since the immune system's natural role is to destroy nascent tumors. Indeed, some cancer doctors believe this could become the main battleground in future.
""It's not yet prime time ... but in the long run I think we will move immunotherapy to a more front-line early disease situation and I hope we will be treating more patients in that setting than in late-stage disease,"" said John Haanen, an oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
JUMP-START
AstraZeneca already has a jump-start here, since its Imfinzi immunotherapy is the new standard of care in treating early inoperable stage III lung cancer. That win follows a decision to run a study in this setting ahead of competitors.
""It was a smart move by AstraZeneca and they are now absolutely in business,"" said Haanen.
Imfinzi sales will be a major focus for investors when the company reports half-year results on July 26.
Competitor Merck last month presented similar stage III results from a small study, but a larger trial using Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) Opdivo drug recently stopped recruiting patients, suggesting direct competition is not imminent.
AstraZeneca hopes to build on this lead in the so-called adjuvant setting, where drugs are given after surgery to keep the cancer from coming back.
Its BR.31 immunotherapy trial with Imfinzi was the first to start adjuvant therapy for lung cancer and the company thinks it could be the first to complete a major trial, with disease-free survival data due in 2020.
""We are certainly hopeful to be the first,"" said David Berman, the group's head of immuno-oncology. 
Berman jumped ship from Bristol-Myers three years ago and believes his new employer has hit on a winning strategy. ""By moving to early stage you can actually leapfrog competitors who are ahead of you in stage IV,"" he said.
Still, the race is on in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, where treatment precedes surgery. With each trial taking several years, picking winners is not easy.
""If everyone is similar on timing, then it is going to come down to data,"" said Liberum analyst Roger Franklin, who rates AstraZeneca a hold.
HOW LONG TO TREAT?
Lung cancer is by far the biggest killer among cancers and the top commercial opportunity for so-called PDx immunotherapy infusions expected to be worth $15 billion in sales this year, according to Thomson Reuters' consensus forecasts.
AstraZeneca estimates the majority of lung cancer patients are being diagnosed relatively early in the disease, when there is a better chance of a cure.
One issue that concerns doctors is how long patients treated post-surgery should take immunotherapy drugs, especially given that they cost nearly $150,000 a year.
Most of the adjuvant trials now under way against various cancers are designed to give drugs for one year. Haanen is skeptical: ""Do you really need a year's treatment? Probably not.""
AstraZeneca is also pushing its early treatment mantra beyond immunotherapy with its lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which works is targeted at patients with specific genetic mutations that are particularly common in the booming Chinese market.
With a clear lead in this particular treatment area, AstraZeneca has time to build out its Tagrisso business in early disease through two big ongoing clinical trials.
Dan Mahony, a healthcare fund manager at Polar Capital, is bullish on AstraZeneca's prospects but reluctant to predict how the fight will play out in the long term.

Still, he says: ""There's more going on at AstraZeneca than met the eye a year ago.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) has behaved inappropriately when dealing with a number of indigenous clients, a powerful misconduct inquiry into the country's financial sector heard on Friday.
Halfway through a year of scheduled hearings, the inquiry has already led to damaging revelations of careless and at times fraudulent lending practices, wiping out tens of billions of dollars from Australian bank valuations, spurring major asset sales and leading to executive departures.
This week, the inquiry or Royal Commission has turned the spotlight on the financial exclusion of indigenous customers who struggle to get access to basic banking facilities or end up with unsuitable products amid predatory sales practices.
Rowena Orr, the barrister assisting the Commission, said ANZ had breached the banking code when its staff refused to open a low-fees bank account for an aboriginal customer on social benefits, despite being eligible.
""ANZ failed to appropriately train its staff who were regularly dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customers to be culturally aware ... those matters invoke available findings of misconduct,"" she said.
Financial services firms should consider efforts to promote inclusion of customers in remote communities, which account for about 3 percent of Australia's population, Orr added.
An ANZ spokesman declined to comment and said the bank would ""make the appropriate submissions to the Royal Commission"". 
Earlier this week, Australia's corporate watchdog called for a ban on debit card overdraft services for indigenous customers, saying their poor understanding of fees left them paying high amounts for basic banking services.
An executive from the watchdog also pointed out at the time to the inquiry how some financial companies took advantage of cultural differences, such as the importance of funeral services in Aboriginal culture, to sell funeral and life insurance plans.
About half of funeral insurance plans in remote indigenous communities are sold to people 20 years old or younger.
Funeral insurer Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) is a case in point, the inquiry heard on Friday.
ACBF, in its dealings with the aboriginal community, has breached laws that carry criminal charges, Orr said.
""Does the current regulatory framework deal adequately with the potential for people with funeral insurance policies to pay more in premiums than may ever be paid out? And should the current regulatory framework be modified to include protections for holders of funeral insurance?"" Orr asked the floor.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. satellite group EchoStar (O:SATS) urged Britain's  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) to open talks about a takeover approach worth $3.2 billion to shareholders just hours before a deadline for the American company to make a firm offer was due to expire.
Shares in Inmarsat fell 8.5 percent on Friday morning to 481 pence after EchoStar revealed it had made a cash and shares bid of 532 pence per share on July 3 that Inmarsat had rejected the following day.
EchoStar, which is chaired by entrepreneur Charlie Ergen, faces a deadline of 1700 London time (1600 GMT) on Friday to make a firm offer or walk away from Inmarsat for six months, under rules laid down by Britain's Takeover Panel.
The U.S. firm said it would proceed with its 532 pence-a-share bid, which values London-listed Inmarsat's equity at 2.45 billion pounds ($3.2 billion), if Inmarsat secured a deadline extension from the panel.
But the British company said in response that EchoStar's bid ""very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects.""
It added: ""The board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat.""
Including Inmarsat's convertible bonds, EchoStar said its offer valued the UK group's equity and convertible debt at 3.2 billion pounds.
SECOND TIME AROUND
It marks EchoStar's second bid for Inmarsat, after the British satellite operator revealed last month that it had spurned an approach from the U.S. group, which sent the FTSE 250 company's shares surging. Just over two weeks later France's Eutelsat Communications (PA:ETL) said it had dropped its interest in the UK company after contemplating a rival approach. 
Some analysts have speculated that Inmarsat is attractive to EchoStar because of its spectrum in the U.S.. 
RBC Capital Markets analysts said last month that Inmarsat's spectrum looked particularly complementary to the frequencies owned by EchoStar's sister company Dish Network Corp (O:DISH), the U.S. satellite television group also chaired by Ergen.
Founded in 1979, London-based Inmarsat was set up by the International Maritime Organization as a way for ships to stay in communication with shore and make emergency calls. 
Since then, the group has become a private company, providing communications for the British armed forces, aircraft, ships, broadcasters, aid agencies and governments through its fleet of 13 satellites. 
Colorado-based Echostar supports similar organizations including the U.S. government with its 23 satellites. 

If the American firm succeeds in agreeing a deal with Inmarsat, any takeover is expected to be closely scrutinized by the British government because of the UK company's position as a strategic asset.

Chinese stock markets also rose in late trading after initial losses close to two-year lows in the morning session. 
""We're in a typical 'buy the rumor, sell the news',"" scenario, said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, strategist at Makor Capital Markets, when asked why markets were not falling giving the trade dispute was moving unequivocally toward a trade war. 
According to Barbier de la Serre, many investors still want to believe that the European Union will stay on the sidelines of the trade war or that the U.S. confrontation with China is just a negotiating posture, which will not lead to a fall in global trade. 
He also noted that with high hopes for the new corporate earnings season beginning in less than two weeks, many traders were reluctant to short European stocks. 
According to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, second-quarter earnings for STOXX 600 companies are expected to increase 8.7 percent from the same period last year. 
Among individual stocks, shares in Britain's  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) posted the worst performance and fell close to 9 percent after it rejected a takeover offer from Echostar. 
Swedish lock maker  Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb) also fell sharply, down 7 percent after reporting a one-off costs of 6 billion crowns ($686 million).

Combined with a PhD from the Swiss university of St. Gallen and 13 years as CEO of a German firm, he has the experience to balance the measured European shareholder approach and American-style activism, analysts say.
""Schneider can hopefully bring both of those things to his role,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said, adding that if he fails to deliver on his strategy, the maker of Gerber baby food and Nescafe could face calls for a break-up.
Third Point sent a letter to the board and published a 34-page presentation on recommendations for Nestle this week but has not given a deadline for the changes, which include selling its L'Oreal (PA:OREP) stake and reorganizing into three business units.
Sources familiar with the matter say the fund had several interactions with Nestle in the past year since becoming a top 10 shareholder. The next meeting, set for autumn, had already been scheduled prior to this week's action, one source said.
As the first outsider to become Nestle CEO in almost a century, Schneider has impressed investors with his candid assessment of the company's problems and lightened the mood at its Lake Geneva headquarters, often seen wearing open-necked shirts and eating in the staff cafeteria.
MARGIN IN FOCUS 
Schneider's track record is strong. At the helm of German healthcare company Fresenius (DE:FREG), he oversaw merger and acquisition (M&A) deals that brought a twelvefold increase in net income.
But industry-wide troubles like changing consumer habits, economic uncertainty and upstart rivals have taken their toll on Nestle, and analysts say its spotty M&A record, sprawling structure and occasional arrogance have not helped. 
Some people think the external pressure from Third Point, which owns about 1 percent of Nestle's shares, may actually help Schneider as he tries to shake up the Swiss company's corporate culture, as well as improve sales and earnings growth.
""Every investor in Nestle wants them to get the margins up a bit faster,"" said Ali Miremadi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management, which owns nearly $73 million of Nestle shares, Reuters data shows.
""That's also what the chief executive and the board want."" 
Schneider has begun with frequent, incremental changes, while avoiding a big bang such as selling Nestle's 23 percent stake in L'Oreal, which Third Point and others advocate.
In 18 months, he has made nine acquisitions and 11 divestitures, mostly very small, and has restructured parts of the business in a bid to boost profits. However, he is wary of inflicting the harsh cost cuts seen among some U.S. food groups in a trend that spread to Europe alongside Kraft-Heinz's (O:KHC) failed bid for  Unilever  (L:ULVR) last year. 
Kraft did not succeed partly because the preoccupation with profit it inherited from shareholder 3G Capital was seen as clashing with the Anglo-Dutch firm's stakeholder approach.
Jefferies analysts described a similar kind of ""culture war"" between Nestle and Third Point and predicted that Nestle would change, but at its own pace.
CHANGING THE GUARD 
Although hiring Schneider was a break with tradition for Nestle, which historically promoted CEOs from within, Third Point has identified the continuing influence of its Chairman Paul Bulcke as a potential problem.
Former CEO Bulcke ""presided over a long period of underperformance, seems too comfortable with the status quo and may be holding up the pace and magnitude of change,"" Third Point said in its presentation. 
Nestle, which declined to comment, this week issued a statement defending its performance.
And longtime shareholder Thomas Russo, of Gardner Russo & Gardner thinks the old guard understands exactly how much things have changed and wants a strategy to match. 
""That's why they brought in Mark ... they didn't bring him in because they thought it would be fun to break with the culture of internal appointments,"" Russo told Reuters.
Schneider is one of a few relatively new executives at Nestle, whose CFO Francois-Xavier Roger, a Frenchman, joined from Takeda Pharmaceutical in 2015, replacing Wan Ling Martello, an American, now head of Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, who joined in 2011.
New independent directors, including Kasper Rorsted, who joined Adidas (DE:ADSGn) as CEO from German packaged goods maker Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), are also likely to bring a fresh eye. 
Rorsted, also with feet on both sides of the Atlantic as a Danish national and Harvard Business alumnus, had success turning around Adidas and Henkel in the United States.
""The new blood has started to overpower the old guard,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said.
For investor Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co, Schneider would not have moved to Nestle if he feared being hamstrung by tradition. 

""(He) will not be hindered in his implementation of his strategic vision,"" Rossbach said. ""The reality is that a lot of these initiatives are long-term by nature ... The question is if Third Point can wait that long.""

537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 03:57AM ET</span>",Airbus raises 20-year market forecast in revamped format,"LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus raised on Friday its forecast for aircraft demand over the next 20 years and revamped the way it predicts aircraft demand, introducing new categories from 'Small' to 'Extra-Large' and blurring the traditional boundaries between aircraft types.
The European planemaker said it was raising its 20-year forecast for aircraft deliveries by more than 7 percent to 37,400 jets, worth $5.8 trillion at list prices. 
That compares with 34,900 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion a year ago, partly as the result of a higher starting point as the industry absorbs another year of brisk growth in air travel.
Dominating the outlook is the market for 'Small' jets up to 230 seats, where Airbus has expanded its portfolio by closing a deal to buy Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) 110-130-seat CSeries jet - mirrored on Thursday by a tentative deal by rival Boeing (N:BA) to acquire the commercial unit of Brazil's Embraer.
These will represent 28,550 deliveries worth $3.2 trillion, or 76 percent of all units delivered over the next 20 years, Airbus said in an annual forecast.
However, it redrew the traditional distinction between single-aisle or narrowbody jets and twin-aisle aircraft, and between the various types of long-distance aircraft, so that direct comparisons with previous sub-totals were not available.
The changes are particularly evident for the largest planes. Instead of singling out jets with 450 or more seats, which effectively means the four-engined Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, Airbus now places all planes with 350 or more seats - including the biggest twinjets - in one box called 'Extra Large'.
It believes 1,590 of these will be delivered over two decades. Other categories include 'Medium' between 230 and 300 seats and 'Large' between 300 and 350 seats.
Airbus has been fighting a statistical battle for years with Boeing over demand for very large jumbos like the 747 and A380, where it has been more bullish than its U.S. rival. 
Boeing says large twinjets like its 777X will soak up most of this demand and has abandoned forecasting the largest models.
The new Airbus framework ignores the number of engines and focuses on bands of seating - reflecting a view that long-term forecasts need not match today's product line-ups - and comes amid debate about the future of the slow-selling A380.
The change in methodology is based on the way airlines use their planes rather than the type of model, spurred in some cases by shifting business models. 
Airbus said it was leaving key assumptions unchanged with average world GDP growth pegged at 2.8 percent, outstripped by average annual air traffic growth of 4.4 percent.
Boeing, which is due to update its 20-year forecast this month, last year predicted total deliveries of 41,030 jets worth $6.1 trillion. Both firms say most new deliveries will permit growth in airline fleets rather than simply replacing old jets.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 03:53AM ET</span>",Chen to become sole chairman of debt-laden HNA after Wang's death,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's HNA Group said it has made co-founder Chen Feng its sole chairman after fellow chairman Wang Jian died this week, moving to calm concerns about leadership amidst the conglomerate's efforts to slash its massive debt burden.
Wang, regarded as the architect of HNA's $50 billion acquisition spree that pushed it into debt, died on July 3 in what local police said appeared to be an accidental fall from a wall while posing for a photograph.
HNA also said that Adam Tan will continue to serve as chief executive and that the board was committed to ""orderly continuity of the company's strategy and operations.""
People familiar with the group's strategy told Reuters that HNA was likely to continue with assets sales as agreed with creditors in the months ahead, with one person saying that there would not be any major ""directional changes"".
They declined to be identified as they were not allowed to discuss internal matters. 
HNA's group borrowing, including bank loans and bonds, surged by more than one-third over the first 11 months of last year to 637.5 billion yuan ($96 billion), according to a China bond market filing seen by Reuters in January.
Since then the aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, whose holdings include a stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), has agreed to sell more than $16 billion worth of overseas assets this year, according to Reuters calculations and media reports.
HNA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about its debt.
""The priority should be to make sure asset sales and debt reduction remain in progress,"" said Warut Promboon, managing partner at credit research firm Bondcritic. He added that HNA also needed to do more to explain its oft-criticized opaque ownership structure.
The group is controlled by a New York-based foundation and a China-based charity that together hold 52 percent of HNA shares. Wang held a 15 percent stake in HNA, and Chen also holds a 15 percent stake.
Shareholders have promised that in the event of leaving the company or dying they would pass their stakes to the charity fund. 
HNA said on Friday that the transfer of the group shares held by Wang will be ""addressed in due course, consistent with his pledge to donate them to charity, and in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory guidelines.""
""HNA needs to explain who owns the two foundations,"" said Bondcritic's Promboon. ""Investors want to know who is behind HNA."" 
Wang told China Economic Weekly magazine in an interview in April, published on Thursday, that it was his proposal that the founder group donate their shares and that it wasn't well received in the beginning.
""It took a long time for everyone to come to understand. I also tried to talk chief Chen into it. I said, children will have their own fortune. If you leave them money, it could do them harm.""
Chen co-founded HNA with Wang in 1993. They brought in billionaire investor George Soros as an early investor in the group flagship firm Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) in 1995 and over the years built it up to become China's fourth largest airline.
But while often the public face of the group, it was primarily Wang who was in charge of HNA's strategy and ran day-to-day operations in recent years, sources familiar with the matter have said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will appoint career bureaucrat Toshihide Endo as its top financial regulator within the month, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday, in a move widely expected to see the continuation of reforms to the country's financial sector. 
Endo, 59, currently director-general of the watchdog's supervisory bureau, will succeed Financial Services Agency (FSA) Commissioner Nobuchika Mori, who in his three-year stint has pushed through reforms designed to boost investor faith in Japan's stock market and stimulate the flow of funds through its economy.
Since 2015 Endo has overseen the country's financial firms at the FSA's supervisory bureau, and previously ran its inspection bureau. Endo joined the finance ministry in 1982, where he held various positions before entering the FSA in 2002. 
When contacted by Reuters, an FSA spokesman declined to comment.
Under Mori's leadership, the FSA has introduced corporate governance reforms designed to make the Japanese market more attractive to investors, from boosting the number of external board directors to urging more vocal engagement by investors.
Mori has held the financial industry partly responsible for the vast amount of household money sitting idle in bank deposits, and criticized investment professionals for not working in the best interest of their clients. 
FSA sources have said Endo is widely expected to continue Mori's reform agenda.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, lost 5.5 trillion yen ($49.7 billion) on its investments in the first quarter as worries about U.S.-China trade friction pushed down stocks in Japan and abroad, the fund said on Friday.
It was GPIF's fourth quarterly loss since it began shifting more of its assets into stocks while slashing bond allocations in October 2014.
GPIF said foreign equities were its worst performers in January-March with a negative return of 6.35 percent. Domestic equities suffered a negative return of 4.72 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.7 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, during the quarter after U.S. President Donald Trump in March signed a memorandum targeting up to $60 billion Chinese goods with tariffs.
The yen's 5.6 percent rise against the dollar during the quarter also eroded the value of GPIF's overseas assets.
GPIF had 156 trillion yen worth of assets under management as of end-March. 
It allocated 25.14 percent to Japanese stocks, 27.5 percent to domestic bonds, 23.88 percent to foreign stocks and 14.77 percent to foreign bonds during the quarter. The remaining 8.7 percent was in short-term assets, mainly cash.
According to a Reuters calculation based on the fund's results, it bought a net 1.8 trillion yen of foreign bonds, 230 billion yen of foreign stocks and 70 billion yen of domestic equities, while reducing 880 billion yen of JGBs.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>","Australia lenders CBA, ANZ censured for pushing pension products","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) have halted sales of complex pension products without proper advice to banking customers at their branches after regulatory action, the regulator said.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Friday staff from the country's No. 1 and No. 3 banks were selling the products during so-called ""financial health checks"" without proper licensing and training.
The country's A$2.6 trillion ($1.92 trillion) savings pool is the world's fourth biggest, and companies servicing it face scrutiny in an ongoing powerful misconduct inquiry that has already rocked the financial services sector. 
On Friday, the regulator said after monitoring the sales process, it was concerned that customers buying the products may have thought ""that the CBA branch staff or the ANZ branch staff were considering risks specific to the customer when this was not the case"". 
It added that branch staff were trained and authorized to provide only general information, not personal advice.
The two lenders agreed to the regulator's enforcement action and would pay a total A$2.5 million in community payments, the regulator said. CBA stopped selling the products at its branches in October, the regulator added. 
From August 18, ANZ will stop discussing the retirement products during conversations with customers about their general needs, the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement.
""We acknowledge ASIC's concerns that customers may have regarded this as personal advice, and have agreed to change our distribution process,"" ANZ Group Executive Wealth, Alexis George, said. 
CBA said it had paused all new account openings for the pension products while it reviews the way in which its staff sell them.

The state's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) said it opened the latest case on June 21, but did not give details on the investigations beyond confirming that they are active and ongoing.
Online auto news website Jalopnik reported on Thursday that the latest investigation follows a complaint from one of the automaker's employees at the plant.
Cal-OSHA spokeswoman Erika Monterroza the first investigation opened on April 12 following a serious injury to a millwright employed by Automatic Systems Inc.
The second investigation was launched on April 17, a day after news website Reveal said that Tesla's omissions in legally mandated reports made its safety record appear better than it was.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",Airbus fails to break deadlock on AirAsia A330neo jet order: sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has failed to break an impasse with AirAsia over the fate of a multi-billion-dollar order seen as key to the future of its A330neo passenger jet, people familiar with the matter said.
AirAsia (KL:AIRA) co-founder Tony Fernandes visited the planemaker this week for talks aimed at shoring up and increasing the existing order for 66 jets, but left Toulouse without signing a deal after what one source described as challenging talks.
The future of the deal with the airline's AirAsia X (KL:AIRX) long-haul unit is crucial to the latest version of the A330, a key source of profits at the European group, after a string of market losses to Boeing's (N:BA) competing 787 Dreamliner.
AirAsia declined to comment.
An Airbus spokesman said, ""As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks with our customers about their fleet needs. We keep the content of those talks confidential."" 
Fernandes - who has spoken in the past of switching to the 787 only to reaffirm support for the A330neo and then raise fresh questions over the Airbus deal - publicly set out a list of conditions for confirming the planes this week.
These included price, performance, engines and advance payments, he said on his Twitter account, before adding: ""Or else"" in a remark apparently designed to leave open the prospect of reviving interest in the Boeing jet.
After meeting Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, Fernandes wrote on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) on Thursday that the A330neo was a ""great aircraft"" for long-haul, low-cost travel, while adding: ""Airbus has to work hard to make it a world beater. Let's see"".
Fernandes, a music executive turned airline mogul, is adroit at keeping suppliers on their toes through his wide social media following. But the suspense over the deal is seen as a crucial test for Airbus as it tries to close a gap in orders this year compared to Boeing and defend the profitable A330 wide-body jet.
Sources say relations between Airbus and its largest Asian customer, which has ordered almost 600 single-aisle jets, have deteriorated following management changes at the planemaker and due to differences over prices and advance payment schedules.AirAsia X also has 10 A350s on order but in April, Fernandes said they were ""too expensive"" and would not be purchased. It is possible those orders could be converted to other jets, such as A330neos.
Airbus nonetheless hopes to strike an expanded final deal in time for the Farnborough Airshow in 10 days.
Airbus is working to secure at least one other significant A330neo order soon, industry sources said. It also posted an order for 10 A330neos from an undisclosed customer.

Airbus said it had ended the first half with 206 net orders, compared with Boeing's total of 306 up to end-May. For wide-body jets, it accumulated 50 net orders by end-June, compared with Boeing's latest available tally of 113 by end-May.

U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods would kick-in at 12:01AM ET (04:01 GMT) on Friday morning.
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, the S&P 500 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite 1.1%.
Trump told reporters that another $16 billion are expected to go into effect in two weeks, and that he is considering to impose additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliate.
First “34, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" Trump said.
“It’s only on China,"" he added.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component climbed 0.2% and 0.3% by 9:45PM ET (01:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also edged up 0.1%.
A editorial piece in state-owned newspaper China Daily raised some eyebrows as it accused the U.S. of “blackmail” and “racketeering”. The newspaper said ""its unruliness looks set to have a profoundly damaging impact on the global economic landscape in the coming decades, unless countries stand together to oppose it.""
""While the objective of the Donald Trump administration's protectionism is to reverse the relative economic decline of the US and benefit selected domestic industries and workers in the US, it will not achieve those aims,"" the paper wrote. ""Instead, the effect will be rising prices in the US, which in turn will affect the balance sheets of many US companies operating in China, since they account for a large proportion of China's exports to the US.""
Chinese officials have said earlier that it would retaliate against Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.
""China will not bow down in the face of threats and blackmail and will not falter from its determination to defend free trade and the multilateral system,” Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday.
South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.1%. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) received some focus as a regulatory filing revealed that its Q2 profit likely rose 5.2% from a year earlier.
April-June profit was likely 14.8 trillion won, the company said, adding that it would disclose detailed earnings in late July.

City Developments Ltd. and UOL Group Ltd. fell more than 14 percent each.
The index tracking property stocks dropped 1.4 percent as of 9:02 a.m. in Singapore Friday, set for the lowest close in more than 15 months. It had risen the most in two weeks Thursday despite a warning from the central bank chief the previous day that there was ""a euphoria"" in the housing market. Bank shares also fell.
“It’s definitely a signal by the government that they are serious about managing the property market,” said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte.
City Developments Ltd. fell 15 percent to S$9.59 a share as of 9:06 a.m. UOL Group Ltd. slid 14 percent to S$6.65. Oxley Holdings Ltd. plunged 15 percent, and stocks including CapitaLand Ltd., SingHaiyi Group Ltd., Keppel Land owner Keppel Corp. and Wing Tai Holdings Ltd. also declined. Many of these are among developers that have added significantly to their Singapore residential landbank, according to KGI.
Far-reaching
The announcement late Thursday of higher stamp duty rates and tougher loan-to-value limits for buyers surprised investors, who had pushed shares of property developers’ higher.
""The policy measures are far-reaching rather than surgical in nature,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Si Xian Goh wrote in a note. ""That first-time home buyers were included in the policy dragnet, however, does suggest that the regulators are concerned that some first-time buyers are buying out of a fear of missing out and contributing to the overall spate of exuberance.""
Individuals taking up their first housing loan will face tighter borrowing limits under the new rules, meaning they have to put up more cash to buy property.
For foreign purchases of residential property, the additional buyers stamp duty increases to 20 percent from 15 percent, while for Singapore citizens the rate increases apply only from their second purchase, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ministry of National Development, and Ministry of Finance said in a joint statement Thursday.
For entities buying any residential properties for development, the additional buyers stamp duty rises by 10 percentage points to 25 percent, with a further five percentage points imposed for developers.
Adjustments to ABSD Rates for Residential Property
DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asia’s biggest lender, fell 2 percent to S$25.49. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. slid 1.4 percent to S$11.34. United Overseas Bank Ltd. dropped 1.6 percent to S$26.66.
""The newly announced measures are likely to have some near-term negative impacton sentiment toward the Singapore banks, although we still see a bright outlookahead driven by higher margins given the rising rates environment and stronggrowth in wealth management,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts Melissa Kuang and Max Jelatianranat wrote in a note. The new measures ""could still dampen the recent pick up in mortgage growth momentum.""
Price Pressure
An index tracking private residential prices jumped 3.4 percent in the three months ended June 30, according to a flash estimate from the Urban Redevelopment Authority this week. That builds on a 3.9 percent gain in the first quarter, which was the biggest since the second quarter of 2010.
The rebound in home prices has prompted aggressive land bids from developers. The government in February raised taxes on home purchases exceeding S$1 million as collective apartment sales reached levels the central bank described as exuberant. The so-called en-bloc sales are where a group of owners band together to sell entire apartment buildings. Singapore home sales jumped to the highest in nine months in May as developers sold 1,121 units."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Fears of a global trade war have left Wall Street bruised but not beaten as the Trump administration on Thursday moved closer to enacting tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports and Beijing threatens to respond immediately.
While China accused the United States of ""opening fire"" on the world, with the tariffs set to take effect on Friday, U.S. stock indexes rose, even with no evidence of last-minute negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials.
Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have roiled financial markets ranging from stocks to currencies to commodities for months. Stocks have been volatile, the dollar has gained and the yield curve for U.S. Treasuries has flattened.

Since March 1, when President Donald Trump said he would impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, igniting fears of a trade war, S&P 500 industrials (SPLRCI) have fallen 4 percent, reflecting the sector's dependence on international commerce. 
The S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> has lost nearly 8 percent since March 1, as investors worry that a slowdown in global demand could offset U.S. steelmakers' benefits from tariffs against their foreign competitors.

But although the S&P 500 on some days has been hit hard by signs of an escalating trade conflict, the index is up 2 percent so far in 2018, helped by deep corporate tax cuts that have boosted companies' earnings and led to massive share buybacks.
Reflecting expectations that small U.S. companies are less at risk than multinationals from tariffs, the Russell 2000 index has outperformed the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq since early March.

Tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the first of a potential total of $450 billion, are due to kick in on Friday over U.S. complaints that China is misappropriating U.S. technology.
Imports of semiconductor-dense products like televisions and smartphones so far have been spared by Trump, but they could be hit if the trade dispute grows.

Car makers, which face higher steel costs due to the tariffs, have been whipsawed. The Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into automobile imports that could lead to additional tariffs.

The dollar and U.S. treasuries have also been sensitive. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, has risen more than 4 percent since March 1. Analysts have said that they expect the dollar to outperform against other currencies in a trade war. 
""A rise in trade protectionism would increase global risk aversion and disproportionately affect non-USD countries due to their relative economic openness,"" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a recent note.
The yuan dropped more than 3 percent against the dollar in June, more than in any other month since 1994, when China unified the market exchange rate.
Worries about a global trade conflict have pushed long-term Treasury yields lower as investors fret about a slowdown in global economic growth. Meanwhile, short-term rates have risen due to expectations of more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

New measures would be introduced to regulate the way in which banks calculate the value of their risk weighted assets, which will affect the amount of capital they must keep to safeguard themselves against shocks, the central bank said.
""We are ensuring that our capital requirement rules align with international standards while being fit for the New Zealand-specific context,"" RBNZ governor Adrian Orr in a statement. 
""All banks must have 'enough skin in the game' to truly focus on enterprise risk management, responsible lending, and the ability to weather all events.""
The changes are in line with international efforts, known as the Basel III rules, aimed at making the global banking system more resilient following the 2008 financial crisis. New Zealand has already adopted some of these rules, which force banks to hold more and different types of capital.
The latest changes included requiring banks to calculate their risk weighted assets using a standardized international approach, rather than relying on individual internal models. 
""This will help shine light on whether the big banks' risk estimates are appropriate,"" Orr said.
The major banks in New Zealand are all owned by Australia's ""Big Four"" - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB).

Two further phases of the review were still underway, including the setting of minimum capital ratios.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors played it safe in June, plucking the most cash out of U.S.-based equity funds since the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis as U.S. trade disputes discouraged risk, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
U.S.-based stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $36.3 billion in withdrawals overall for the month of June, according to the research service, preliminary figures that would represent the largest withdrawals since October 2008.
The data also showed the funds have posted five straight weeks of withdrawals as the Trump administration's tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports are due to go into effect on Friday.
During the most recent, holiday-shortened week, $8.3 billion moved out of U.S.-based equity funds and high-yield bond funds shed $1.7 billion, Lipper said. U.S. markets were closed on July 4 for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
The possibility of a trade war has distracted markets from a robust U.S. economic picture, and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting released on Thursday showed monetary policymakers share some of the markets' concerns.
Most Fed policymakers ""noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects,"" according to the minutes.
""The tariffs, the uncertain trade policy, and whether that could lead, that's definitely been a negative,"" said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.
""Things will settle down over time once we actually know what the end result is going to be.""
Investors piled into safer, higher-quality investments, which included U.S.-based government-Treasury bond funds. That group attracted $980 million of net new cash for the week ended Wednesday, their fifth straight week of inflows, Lipper said.

(Reuters) - (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Twenty years ago, Seth Goldman succeeded in his years-long quest to find an after-run drink that was tasty, yet low in sugar and calories. 
His Honest Tea is now ubiquitous in stores. But Goldman started brewing and distributing the initial tea samples from his home. 
After originally partnering with his former Yale professor, Barry Nalebuff, they sold the company to the Coca-Cola Co in 2011. Goldman, 52, lives near the company’s Bethesda, Maryland, headquarters and remains involved - his current title is “Co-Founder & TeaEO Emeritus of Honest Tea."" 
In 2013, he and Nalebuff wrote a graphic book, “Mission in a Bottle: The Honest Guide to Doing Business Differently - and Succeeding,” telling the story of their company and sharing tips with entrepreneurs. 
For the latest in the Reuters series “Life Lessons,” Goldman shared more advice on his strategies in business and in life.
Q: What lesson would you say people can learn from the risks you took in order to start your business?
A: Not having a lot of money in the beginning actually provided a healthy discipline. We were forced to be creative and resourceful with everything - our marketing, our staffing, our office 'décor' (i.e., dumpster diving for used desks, which I still use!). 
Q: Where did you get your entrepreneurial spirit?
A: Although both of my grandparents ran their own small businesses, my role model as an entrepreneur was my father. He was a professor, which is normally not an entrepreneurial profession. But he led such a dynamic life – creating academic programs and seminars, serving as a founding board member of several charities and a local bank. He ingrained in me the mindset that if you think something should be done, you don’t wait on someone else to do it.
Q: Tell us about your first job - What did it teach you?
A: When I was 8, I sold used golf balls and lemonade with my next-door neighbor at the local golf course. The retrieval of the balls from bushes and rivers was almost as much fun as selling them. I learned early on that not getting the sale was just part of life – not a personal rejection of me or my golf balls or lemonade. That thick skin still comes in handy.
Q: As you became more established in your career, what did you learn about handling money? 
A: Entrepreneurs who focus only on accumulating money as their goal can be disappointed in several ways – first, they may not see a pay day. Second, if they do have a pay day, it can be anticlimactic because once it comes, there’s not much more to do but accumulate more money, and that has diminishing returns in terms of satisfaction. 
Q: Is giving important and if so, who do you support?
A: Before we sold Honest Tea, my wife and I donated a significant portion of our shares to a charitable vehicle called Impact Assets. It allowed the proceeds of the sale to be donated to non-profits, such as Urban Alliance, where my wife works, or to be invested in dynamic social enterprises, such as Ripple Foods or Beyond Meat (where I serve as a board member). If those companies have a successful exit, the proceeds go back into Impact Assets – so we get the chance to continue the virtuous circle.
Q: What money or life lessons have you tried to pass on to your sons?
A: We were happy as a family before Honest Tea’s success because we understood what made us happy – being able to take joy in each other, in nature, in Boston sports teams and in close friendships. We continue to be happy as a family because we still value those things. Money doesn’t change that.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - San Francisco-based payments processor  Square Inc . (N:SQ) said on Thursday it had withdrawn its regulatory application to open a deposit-taking bank, but that the company plans to refile its paperwork at a later date.
The fintech firm last year applied with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) for a special ""industrial loan company (ILC)"" license that, if granted, allows nontraditional financial firms to collect government-insured deposits.
“We have been engaged in constructive dialogue with the FDIC, and our decision to withdraw and refile was a procedural step in the review process that will allow us to amend and strengthen some areas of our FDIC insurance application,"" a Square representative said in an emailed statement.
The company said its separate ILC charter application with the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions remains active. 
""We continue to work closely with the FDIC and Utah DFI on our applications,"" the representative said.
The company did not provide an anticipated time frame for reapplying with the FDIC. 
Square's decision was first reported by trade journal American Banker.
Fintech firms are closely watching to see if Jelena McWilliams, a former banker who took over the FDIC last month, will end the regulator's informal moratorium on issuing ILC licenses - one of the few ways nonbank companies can move into deposit-taking.
During her Senate confirmation hearing in January, McWilliams said she would address the holdup on the issuance of such licenses and would grant them if the applications met the FDIC's standards. 
The issuance of ILCs to the likes of car manufactures and supermarkets has long been a controversial issue. The powerful small bank lobby has strongly opposed ILCs, which they say allows nonbanks to circumvent tough bank rules

The Independent Community Bankers of America trade group had publicly opposed Square's application, saying fintech firms should be subject to the same restrictions and supervision as traditional banks.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 05:54PM ET</span>","Boeing to take over $4.75 billion Embraer unit, targeting Airbus-Bombardier","By Brad Haynes and Tim Hepher
SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) struck a deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) under a new $4.75 billion joint venture, the firms said on Thursday, reshaping a global passenger jet duopoly.
The new company, encompassing Embraer's airliner business, thrusts Boeing into the lower end of the market, giving stiffer competition to the CSeries jets designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
The memorandum of understanding signed by Boeing and Embraer values the Brazilians' commercial aircraft operations, the world's third-largest, at $4.75 billion and Boeing's planned 80-percent stake in the venture at $3.8 billion.
The Boeing-Embraer alliance, following on the heels of the Airbus-Bombardier tie-up announced last year, represents the biggest realignment in the global aerospace market in decades, strengthening established Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan, analysts say.
Chief Executive Paulo Cesar Silva told employees in a note reviewed by Reuters that consolidation in the aerospace supply chain had also forced Embraer's hand.
""This has been happening with both our suppliers and our clients. They have started to organize in big blocs, making it harder for companies of Embraer's size to negotiate,"" he said.
Embraer shares fell 10 percent in New York and nearly 15 percent in Sao Paulo on disappointment at the financial terms of the long-awaited deal.
The price tag for Embraer's commercial aviation unit was ""significantly lower"" than early reports, according to analysts at Vertical Research Partners, who underscored in a client note that a deal must still clear political and regulatory barriers before closing as proposed at the end of next year.
""We also see strong odds of Embraer shareholders demanding a higher price for the stake in the commercial segment,"" wrote BTG Pactual analysts Renato Mimica and Samuel Alves in a note.
The partnership, which adds a 70- to 130-seat family to Boeing's lineup, is expected to boost the U.S. firm's earnings per share from 2020, generating annual pre-tax cost savings of about $150 million by the third year, the companies said.
Boeing shares were little changed on Thursday.
CASH AND DEBT
Embraer will transfer much of its debt to the new venture and receive cash from Boeing, Embraer executives told analysts. 
About a fifth of the cash payment will go to taxes and the rest could be split between share buybacks, a special dividend, deleveraging and new product development, they said.
Silva told employees in his note that Embraer would improve its cash position by $1 billion once the deal closes, allowing more investment in new projects. 
Embraer will hold the remaining 20 percent of the Boeing joint venture and keep control of its defense and business jet operations. Concern over U.S. influence in military programs had raised flags in the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto at Embraer dating back to its privatization.
However, recent signals from Brazil's President Michel Temer and military officials suggest the government is satisfied with the new structure of the tie-up, as long as Brazilian jobs are maintained and Embraer continues to develop new technology.
One government official said the deal as announced on Thursday was likely to get approval in Brasilia. Another official said government approval was not certain and would depend on the final details presented later this year. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In addition to the passenger jet deal, Boeing and Embraer will deepen a sales and services partnership on the new KC-390 military cargo jet through a separate defense venture that is likely to eventually receive a joint investment, Silva said.
A union of metalworkers in Sao Jose dos Campos, where Embraer is based, said in a statement it would ""pressure"" the federal government to use the golden share it owns in Embraer to veto the deal. 
The Embraer-Boeing tie-up took shape more than two years after the idea was first presented internally to Boeing's board and reflects a longstanding affinity between the two planemakers, a person familiar with the discussions said. 
However, the pressure for an alliance accelerated when Airbus last year announced it would take control of the CSeries jet, which had been struggling in its battle with Embraer at the small end of the airliner market. 
That deal put enormous marketing weight behind Embraer's competitor, while for Boeing the transatlantic tie-up threatened to expand the revenue base of its European arch-rival.

""The Boeing-Embraer announcement confirms the strong market potential in the 100- to 150-seat category,"" Airbus said through a spokesman. ""Boeing and Embraer are following Airbus and Bombardier.""

“They are pretty confident in their baseline outlook” and will stick to their plan of continuing to raise interest rates, said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank AG. “Trade is the gorilla in the room and nobody knows how bad” the mounting dispute could be for businesses.
U.S. central bankers are trying to keep the economy on a sustainable path as growth gets a boost from tax cuts and additional government spending. Minutes of the Fed’s June 12-13 meeting released Thursday showed officials committed to moving toward a slightly restrictive monetary policy, based on their outlook that low unemployment will lift wages and keep inflation near their 2 percent target over the medium term.
At the same time, they showed concern that trade wars could hurt business sentiment and investment, noting that industry contacts said that it was already having an impact.
“They have a lot of reasons to keep raising interest rates gradually,” said Laura Rosner, senior economist at Macropolicy Perspectives LLC in New York. “You get a sense, though, that they are preparing for surprises.”
The U.S. has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and threatened to slap more levies on other products from some of its biggest trading partners, particularly China and the European Union. All have vowed to retaliate in what would amount to a trade war that could raise prices and slow the global expansion. U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to go into force early Friday.
“Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified,” the minutes said.
Nevertheless, with the economy strong and unemployment below their estimate of its long-run sustainable rate, officials judged “it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer-run level by 2019 or 2020,” the minutes showed.
At the June meeting, officials unanimously raised the main lending rate for the second time in 2018 -- to a target range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent -- and lifted their median projection to a total of four hikes this year, from three estimated in March. Fed officials also forecast that their campaign of gradual rate increases would move policy to a restrictive setting, or one that was slowing growth, by the end of 2019.
Reflecting that eventuality, the minutes said a “number” of officials said it might “soon be appropriate” to modify language in the Fed’s post-meeting statement that currently describes rates as “accommodative.”
U.S. unemployment was 3.8 percent in May, matching the lows since the late 1960s, and the Fed’s preferred gauge of consumer prices rose 2.3 percent on annual basis in May. Officials have said they will tolerate a slight overshoot to bolster inflation expectations after years of being under the target.
The minutes said U.S. central bankers debated the amount of labor-market slack left in the economy, with “several” participants saying “there was further scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce.”
Officials also discussed risks of inflation, with “a number” of them saying it was “premature to conclude that the committee had achieved” its 2 percent inflation target on a sustainable basis.
On the other hand, some officials voiced the concern that “a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.”

568,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. June Payrolls Expected to Rise 200,000 With Jobless Rate Steady
The U.S. Labor Department will issue what are widely considered among the most important economic numbers Friday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) when it releases figures for June employment.
Nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have risen by 200,000 last month, compared with a rise of 223,000 in May.
Economists expect that the unemployment rate stayed steady at 3.8% last month, matching the low last seen in April 2000. That’s as low as the jobless rate has been since it hit 3.5% in December 1969.
Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% in June, the same as the month before.
According to Thursday’s ADP report, private employers added 177,000 jobs in June, fewer than the 190,000 gain economists predicted. Private sector jobs growth was revised to 189,000 in May from a previously reported 178,000.
As payrolls keep increasing, investors will be looking for signs from companies that the move toward full employment is impacting their ability to fill positions with qualified personnel.
2. U.S.-China Tariffs Going Into Effect
Even with the jobs numbers coming out, market volume will be low on a holiday-week summer Friday. That will make an already trade-talk-sensitive market susceptible to jawboning from either the U.S. or its allies.
The market was buoyed by reports on Thursday that the U.S. would be willing to forego any tariffs on European Union vehicles if the EU lifted duties on American autos.
The Nasdaq OMX global auto index finished the day about 1.2% higher.
Also, the tit-for-tat $34 billion tariffs between the U.S. and China go into effect tomorrow at 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT). China has said it will not fire the first shot, but will act in response to U.S. tariffs.
The Federal Reserve minutes for the June rate meeting indicated some concern of the FOMC about the economic impact of tariffs.
“Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,” the minutes said.
3. Look out for Yield Curve Jitters
Financial stocks may see some bigger-than-usual moves, especially with the low volume tomorrow, as investors speculate about the yield curve.
The yield curve is especially important to banks, which pay out at lower short-term rates, but loan at higher long-term rates. And it hit the Fed’s radar at its June meeting.
“A number of participants thought it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve, given the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of recession in the United States,” the Fed minutes said."
569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 04:04PM ET</span>",Wall Street climbs as trade fears ease,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes rose on Thursday as reports that the United States and the European Union may agree to withdraw auto tariffs fostered optimism on international trade relations among investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 182.74 points, or 0.76 percent, to 24,357.56, the S&P 500 gained 23.51 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,736.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.75 points, or 1.12 percent, to 7,586.43.

""Sacred Games,"" based on the 2006 novel by Vikram Chandra, is a thriller set in Mumbai with a cast of police officers, politicians and spies, and stars some of Bollywood's biggest personalities: Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte.
The eight-episode series, in Hindi and with English subtitles, is the first of seven original Indian series for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), including a new adaptation announced last week of Salman Rushdie's 1981 epic novel ""Midnight's Children.""
Netflix now has more than 125 million subscribers around the world and has said it expects a large chunk of future growth to come from India.
Cheap data has spurred the rise of streaming video usage in India, the world's fastest growing Web services market, and turned it into a battleground for content wars between global giants such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix as they look for growth beyond a saturated U.S. home market.
India's media and entertainment market is expected to grow to more than $31 billion in two years, from $22.7 billion in 2017.
Netflix, which launched in India in 2016, has also said it is developing a multilingual espionage series ""Bard of Blood,"" female-led supernatural series ""Again"" and ""Selection Day,"" a story of cricket and corruption.

Other Netflix series in the works include ""Leila,"" about an Indian woman searching for her lost daughter; ""Ghoul,"" a horror series based on Arabic folklore and set in a covert detention center; and young adult murder mystery ""Crocodile.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors peeled out of stocks, pulling the most cash since February in the most recent week as global trade tensions vexed markets, Investment Company Institute data showed on Thursday.
Investors snatched $18 billion from U.S.-based equity funds, according to the trade group's data for the week ended June 27. That is the most since the turbulent week ended Feb. 7, according to ICI's records.
During that week earlier this year the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,600 points in its biggest intraday point drop in history as investors girded for a spike in inflation and bond yields.
Now, conflict between the United States and its trading partners appears to be markets' biggest boogeyman. Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) announced during the week it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc's retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year.
""Trouble stems from the fact that despite the Trump administration's steadfast willingness to place tariffs on other nations, there is no clear strategy as to the scope and timing on the next wave of actions,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, in a note distributed on Thursday.
""This groundswell of ambiguity has frayed investors' nerves.""
The Trump administration's tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports are due to go into effect on Friday.
That has started to shake the foundations of a long run of success for funds that invest in equities traded outside the United States. Those funds took in cash from 79 straight weeks starting in late 2016 only to have that streak broken this month.
The $5.4 billion that rolled out from those international stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the most recent week is the most withdrawn since an August 2015 selloff sparked by concerns about Chinese growth. U.S. fund investors pulled $12.5 billion from domestic stocks in the most recent week.
Investors have turned to high-quality, short-dated debt for safety. Bond funds attracted $3 billion during the recent seven-day period, marking 19 straight weeks taking in cash, ICI said.
Commodity funds, including those invested in gold, faced a fourth week of withdrawals. Demand for gold, which is priced in dollars, has been pressured by the greenback's 4 percent rise over the last three months.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Global automakers hail more ships as trade battles heat up,"By Nick Carey, Jonathan Saul and Brenda Goh
DETROIT/LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers are scrambling to ship vehicles to the United States to pre-empt possible higher tariffs, according to port data, port officials and logistics companies.
Data from a number of U.S. ports showed a surge in vehicle exports and imports in May, as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on China and Europe to drop tariffs on U.S. vehicles and make other changes to their trade practices. May is the most recent month for which figures are available.
The Trump administration's tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports are due to go into effect at 0401 GMT on Friday, which is just after midday in Beijing.
In the United States, the ports of Baltimore, Jacksonville, Florida; and Brunswick, Georgia - the three leading U.S. ports for importing automobiles - in May unloaded a combined 23,000 more cars than they did a year earlier. Auto exports out of Baltimore and Jacksonville that month were up 39 percent and 19 percent, respectively, port officials said. 
At the port of Long Beach, whose auto customers include Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and also  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)’s Mercedes-Benz, vehicle imports were up 3.4 percent in May, but exports were down 24 percent at 1,679 units. 
Vehicle imports in Norfolk, Virginia, rose more than 350 percent to 3,782 vehicles, partly due to General Motors Co (N:GM) importing some cars from Mexico by sea to circumvent U.S. rail network problems.
According to DataStream, which has weekly railcar loading data by product type, the four-week rolling sum of automobile car loadings hit a 14-month high in early-to-mid-May.
The increase in vehicles landing in the United States was not preceded by a surge in sales. U.S. sales of some European and Asian autos, including BMW (DE:BMWG), Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, are flat to down this year. 
Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) did not respond to requests for comment. 
Trump said on Friday his administration's investigation into whether to increase tariffs on cars from the European Union and other trading partners would be completed in three to four weeks. 
Last week two major auto trade groups warned that imposing tariffs on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.
Even without tariffs, automakers and analysts were already expecting U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in 2018 versus last year, creating a highly competitive market. 
Tariffs could force automakers to either raise car prices or absorb the higher cost.
A 25 percent tariff could, for instance, add $8,000 to $10,000 or more to the price an imported BMW 3 series sedan, making the luxury vehicle less attractive to buyers versus an American-made car. 
In late June, German automaker Daimler warned that new import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt sales of high-margin Mercedes-Benz sports utility vehicles and eat into its pretax profit. 
As the United States, China and Europe exchanged tariff threats during the spring, global automakers began ""a push to speed up delivery to markets where tariffs are scheduled to increase, such as the U.S.,"" said a spokeswoman for Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics ASA (OL:WWLO), which specializes in hauling vehicles by sea.
CHINA'S TARIFF DROP
In China, automakers sought to slow down vehicle imports after the government said tariffs on foreign-made vehicles would drop to 15 percent from 25 percent as of July 1.
Wang Chun, deputy director of the China Automobile Dealers Association's import committee, said the group noticed a sharp decrease in car imports and imported vehicle sales in May.
""It's possible that they were delaying shipping so that they could take advantage of the new tariff effective from July 1st,"" Chun said last week.
Chinese port data is not yet available for May, but imports rose 5.7 percent to more than 4.3 million vehicles in April. 
China, which cut tariffs on all imported automobiles this week, plans to slap an additional 25 percent levy on 545 American products, including U.S.-made cars, starting on Friday, should the Trump administration's tariffs go into effect.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Thursday that for now it will not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China, thus absorbing the cost of the new tariffs.

583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",$49 Billion Fund Loads Up on Chinese Shares,"(Bloomberg) -- A fund managing pensions for some of Australia’s smartest people is buying Chinese equities in size for the first time after shares in the world’s second-biggest economy slumped into a bear market.
“We have used the latest sell-off to build a position in China A shares,” said John Pearce, chief investment officer of UniSuper Management Pty, which controls A$67 billion ($49 billion) of assets primarily for Australia’s higher education and research sector. “This is really the first time we have had a position of any significance.”
Pearce has hired BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). to manage some of its China equity book, while the remainder will be done by the UniSuper team of fund managers, he said in an interview in Sydney. He declined to say how much would be allocated to the Chinese market.
Skittish investors have dumped Chinese stocks in recent weeks amid concerns on growth after a string of weaker economic data and escalating trade tensions with the Trump administration. The People’s Bank of China sought to shore up confidence in financial markets this week after the recent weakness in the yuan, pledging to keep the currency stable.
“People are just getting a bit too carried away by it all,” Pearce said. “If you look at the history of any major stock-market – and China is a massive market – if you had blindly just bought the market after a 20 percent selloff, more often than not you’ve made money in 12 months time.”
The yuan fell more than 3 percent against the greenback in June, the worst monthly decline since 1994 when the Chinese government unified the official and market exchange rates. The Shanghai Composite Index, where the nation’s so-called A shares trade, has fallen more than 20 percent from its January high.
The Australian pension is not the only investor taking advantage of the slump in Chinese shares. Hedge fund Shanghai Chongyang Investment Management Co. is is adding shares of thermal power and electrical equipment firms, consumer and financial companies as well as dividend plays, according to its president Wang Qing.
UniSuper, whose fund members include current and former Australian university staff, has also tasked BlackRock to invest in emerging-market investment-grade corporate bonds. “If you look at credit spreads and how much they’ve widened, to us the corporates are in pretty good shape,” Pearce said.
The fund’s balanced investment option returned 10.4 percent for the year to June, according to Pearce."

601,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 12:14PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse pays U.S. $77 million to settle Asia hiring corruption probes,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) agreed to pay about $77 million to settle U.S. bribery probes into its awarding of jobs to family and friends of Chinese and other government officials in the Asia-Pacific region, to win lucrative investment banking business.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said Credit Suisse's Hong Kong unit will pay a $47.03 million criminal fine and enter a non-prosecution agreement, in which the Swiss bank admitted and accepted responsibility for wrongdoing.
Credit Suisse will also pay $29.82 million to settle related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil claims.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) agreed to pay about $264 million in Nov. 2016 to settle similar probes into its hiring practices.
Credit Suisse was accused of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by hiring and promoting dozens of people connected with Asian government officials from 2007 to 2013, as a quid pro quo to win banking business.
The SEC said Credit Suisse offered jobs to more than 100 people with such ties during the period, including over 60 recommended by officials from Chinese state-owned companies.
Authorities said many of these ""relationship hires"" or ""referral hires"" were less qualified than other job candidates who lacked the desired ties.
They said one referral hire was the daughter of a top official for a state-owned Chinese energy company.
Authorities said a senior Credit Suisse investment banker in Hong Kong called the daughter ""a princess (who was) not used to too many rounds of interview,"" and that employees crafted a resume for her that had to be ""a bit 'creative'"" in the details.
""Trading employment opportunities for less-than-qualified individuals in exchange for lucrative business deals is an example of nepotism at its finest,"" William Sweeney, assistant director-in-charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office, said in a statement.
Credit Suisse said it has made numerous upgrades to its internal compliance procedures and controls, and there were no allegations that clients or counterparties were harmed.
The bank had disclosed the expected Justice Department settlement last month.

Credit Suisse, under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, is in the final stage of a three-year restructuring, following three straight annual losses tied in part to legal settlements and a scaling back of its investment banking business.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","UK court lets Indian banks search, seize tycoon Mallya's properties: media","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A consortium of Indian banks can search and seize the properties of Indian businessman Vijay Mallya in Britain, media reports said on Thursday, citing the decision of a British court.
India wants to extradite Mallya from Britain on fraud charges and to help nearly a dozen Indian banks recover loans granted to his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines after the tycoon, co-owner of the Force India Formula One motor racing team, fled to Britain in March 2016.
The case against Mallya centers on a series of loans Kingfisher obtained from Indian banks, and in particular from state-owned IDBI. Indian banks want to recover more than $1 billion that Indian authorities say Kingfisher owes.
The British court order allows the UK High Court Enforcement Officer to enter Mallya's properties in Britain, giving a legal option to Indian banks to try and recover the dues, media reports said, citing the court decision.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the court decision.
Separately, the Indian government’s Enforcement Directorate, which fights financial crimes, has filed an application to seek to declare Mallya a ""fugitive economic offender"" and sought to confiscate 125 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) worth of his assets.
In a statement issued last week, Mallya said he was trying to sell assets worth about $2.04 billion to repay creditors.
Mallya, who denies the charges against him, said any objection by the Enforcement Directorate or India's federal police to his proposals to sell assets ""will clearly demonstrate that there is an agenda against me beyond recovery of dues to Public Sector Banks.""
""I have become the 'Poster Boy' of bank default and a lightning rod of public anger,"" Mallya said in his statement last week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the escalating battle over U.S. prescription drug prices, major pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to limit the economic damage from a new U.S. insurer tactic that coaxes patients away from expensive drugs. 
The latest move by insurers - which effectively forces drug companies to pay more to assist patients with their copays - is causing a decline in real U.S. drug prices this year, and is expected to become more widely adopted in 2019. 
That reality is forcing drugmakers to devise their own response in the near term, according to interviews with pharmaceutical and insurance industry executives and consultants. Among major drugmakers,  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) have said the most so far about the new tactic, and more drugmakers will likely face questions about it during quarterly earnings calls in July.
In recent years, insurers have tried to guide patients toward less expensive treatments by making them pay a higher portion of a drug's costs. Drugmakers responded by dramatically raising the financial aid they offer, in the form of ""copay assistance"" cards - similar to a debit card - that reduce what consumers need to pay when they place their pharmacy order.
Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), which manage prescription drug coverage for large U.S. employers, say these payments shield consumers from drug costs, making it easier for manufacturers to raise those prices. Insurers have to make up the difference.
This year, Express Scripts and others introduced a new ""copay accumulator"" approach for its corporate customers. The programs prevent copay card funds from counting toward a patient's required out-of-pocket spending before insurance kicks in on expensive specialty drugs, such as arthritis and HIV treatments. 
As an example, a patient whose medicine costs $1,000 per month might be required to pay that amount until they reach a deductible of $2,000 set by their insurer. A copay card from the drugmaker would cover most, or all, of those costs for the patient and it would count towards the deductible.  When the deductible is reached, the insurance begins to pay.
But if the insurance plan is using an accumulator, the patient could still have to pay the $2,000 out of pocket when their copay card expires or runs out of money. Some more aggressive accumulator programs will also draw more money than a drugmaker expected to pay off a copay card when the card is detected.  
These tactics could force the drugmaker to keep paying the out of pocket costs. Otherwise the patient could move to an equivalent drug if one is available or abandon their prescription because it is too expensive.
PHARMA FIGHTS BACK
Drugmakers are working on ways to counter copay accumulator programs, fearing that more employer health plans will adopt them in 2019.  
They include new payment options to evade detection by the pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) so that a patient still benefits from the financial aid, said Matthew Turner, who is working with drugmakers as director of patient affordability at TrialCard, which operates copay cards for companies. He would not provide details of how those arrangements work.
Larger drugmakers may have the financial flexibility to monitor how these accumulator programs affect revenue over time, while those reliant on a small number of drugs may not be able to wait it out, Turner said. 
Drugmakers are also taking a tougher stance when negotiating prices or new discounts for payers, according to insurance industry executives and pharmaceutical consultants. 
They have reason for concern. A survey by the National Business Group on Health (NBGH), which represents large corporate employers, showed that 17 percent of respondents said they were currently using a copay accumulator program. Another 18 percent of respondents are considering using one next year or in 2020. 
Real U.S. drug prices, including discounts and rebates, fell 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, mostly due to copay accumulator programs, according to Sector and Sovereign Research.
Amgen has said that it altered copay assistance cards for arthritis drug Enbrel to work only if the funds are applied to a patient's deductible. The company would not say how it responds when a patient is affected by an accumulator, adding the information was proprietary.
AbbVie in April said that about 4 percent of patients taking rival arthritis drug Humira were exposed to accumulators, but that they had no material effect on company profits. 
Belgium's UCB, which makes a competing drug called Cimzia, said in February that it was reaching out to patients affected by the programs to help them stay on the medication.
Savings can be substantial for employers when accumulators coax patients to switch to a drug for which they receive the highest rebate. For instance, rebates to PBMs for Humira and Enbrel can differ by as much as $1,000 per prescription, according to Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions.
At CVS Health, accumulator programs help reduce specialty drug spending by about 5 percent for its customers' health plans, spokeswoman Christine Cramer said.
Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), told Reuters they expect the programs to expand. 
UnitedHealth tracks copay assistance payments at its mail order specialty pharmacy BriovaRx and wants to introduce them to other specialty pharmacies it works with, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sam Ho said. 
UnitedHealth calls patients to tell them their copay cards will no longer count towards deductibles, and suggests switching to a less pricey drug, if available, or provides information on charity assistance, he said. 
When asked how drugmakers have responded to UnitedHealth's program, Dr. Ho said the manufacturers are taking a tough stance in new price negotiations.
Kevin Cast, a partner at pharmaceutical consulting firm Archbow Consulting, said drugmakers may be better off providing greater discounts to the PBMs in exchange for ending the copay accumulator. Concocting an alternative payment method is only a temporary fix, he said.

""As soon as a copay card company makes a slight adjustment, they'll figure it out,"" he said.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",London electric cab maker joins in Brexit warnings,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The London EV Company, the maker of London's familiar black cabs, has joined a chorus of carmakers warning about the impact that a hard Brexit could have on business, with its chairman saying it could dismantle Britain's rejuvenated car industry. 
Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] said earlier a so-called ""hard Brexit"" would cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing its future operations in the United Kingdom.
Uncertainty over Brexit has halved new investment in the British car industry, the country's main car lobby group said last month.
""What we really worry about is if there are big difficulties transporting goods via the Channel, whether it's increased costs, or anything else,"" Carl-Peter Forster, chairman of LEVC, told journalists in Berlin at the launch of its electric taxi in Germany.
""Even with no tariffs, lorries could still be stuck at the border for days,"" he said, highlighting how the industry relied on frictionless supply chains to transport components and assembled vehicles back and forth across the Channel.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is also in Berlin on Thursday, meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel, for Brexit talks. 
One-third of LEVC's suppliers are in the UK, another third in Europe and the rest elsewhere in the world, Chief Executive Chris Gubbey said. 
LEVC, owned by China's Geely (HK:0175), invested 300 million pounds ($398 million) in a new plant in Ansty near Coventry when it made the shift to electric vehicles, the first new automotive plant to be built in Britain in over a decade. 
Forster, a Britain-born German, said that, ""if the wrong decision is made"", people should have no illusions about the extent of the impact on Britain's car industry which has been undergoing a revival in terms of manufacturing in recent years. 
""You won't see it overnight, it's a process that will take 10-15 years.... It would be madness to wake up in the morning in London and read in the papers that there are virtually no carmakers in Britain, it would be a real shame.""
Forster was speaking as LEVC launched the electric version of the traditional black London taxi cab in Germany, where the market is dominated by Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes, in which Geely also owns a 10 percent stake.
LEVC hopes that the electric taxi, which is available in the more typical beige color of German taxi cabs, will find takers as a debate about clean air and urban mobility rages. 
It is close to finalizing a deal with sister company Volvo for sales and servicing in Germany. 
LEVC isn't likely to seriously challenge Mercedes, however, with Gubbey saying that it was looking to sell hundreds, rather than thousands, of taxis in Germany. 
Gubbey said that he wasn't seeing Brexit having any impact on negotiations with potential customers. 
Along with the Netherlands, Norway and now Germany, LEVC is also in negotiations in France and has plans to expand to customers outside of Europe from next year, particularly in the UAE, Australia, Singapore and China.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares headed for a third day of gains on Thursday as reassuring economic data from Germany and a report that its big carmakers could be spared from U.S. tariffs offset another gloomy session for Asia.
Trade nerves had pegged Asia's bourses back with a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports just a day away, but it was another widely-flagged target - the German car sector - that spurred Europe's rally and pushed up Wall Street futures.[.EU] (N)
Mercedes-maker Daimler, BMW  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_P) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) raced up as much as 5 percent after reports of a U.S. offer to suspend tariff threats on EU-made cars if the bloc lifts its duties on U.S. ones.
It fueled the wider European auto sector's best day in more than two years with the mood also been helped by a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders after four months of falls.
""With these stories coming out (about car tariffs), you have a sector which has been very oversold meeting some potential good news on the trade war front,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) European equity strategist James Barty. 
""This is going to be the dominant issue of the summer. Are we heading for a full-blown trade war in which case it is very bad news for risk assets, or do we walk away from it, in which case, as we have seen today, markets are likely to rebound quite sharply.""
The euro briefly topped $1.17 and bond yields rose after the brighter German data and after a report that the ECB thinks markets are now too cautious on when it will raise euro zone interest rates next year.[FRX/]
Sterling gained ground too as the head of the Bank of England confirmed it was still planning to raise UK rates this year. Later in the day, traders will get the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting when it raised U.S. rates for a second time this year.
""The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,"" said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
ASIAN ANGST
The ongoing angst over U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs had extended the recent slide in Asian markets overnight, in particular Chinese shares which are now deep into ""bear"" market territory. 
On Friday, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect. Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind, though it said overnight that it would ""absolutely not"" fire the first shot in a trade war. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has dropped every day except three since mid June, ended down 0.25 percent. The index has lost about 2 percent this week, plumbing a nine-month low in the process.
Japan's Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, South Korea's KOSPI slipped 0.4 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 0.2 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent to take its dive since late January to 23 percent.
With Europe advancing though, Wall Street's S&P 500 futures and Dow and Nasdaq futures were all up 0.6-0.7 percent, pointing to a solid start following Wednesday's U.S. Independence Day holiday. (N)
""The $34 billion U.S. tariffs figure has been mostly factored by the markets and focus is now on what the United States says on the remaining $16 billion (of a promised $50 billion tariff plan),"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.
WEAPONIZE
In currencies, the euro's gain was the dollar's loss. That also helped ease some of the pressure on volatile emerging market currencies, even Turkey's battered lira recovered from an early slip triggered by its prime minister saying cutting interest rates was a top priority. [EMRG/FRX]
The Chinese yuan was slightly lower though, its recovery from an 11-month low stalling. A rebound was triggered in the past two sessions after the country's central bank sought to calm nervous markets and stem the recent tumble.
The longer term direction for the yuan was still unclear. China appears broadly comfortable with a weakening yuan and would intervene only to prevent any destabilizing declines or to restore market confidence, policy insiders told Reuters.
""Although we do not believe China will weaponize its currency, we do believe the current trajectory of Chinese yuan depreciation is justified,"" strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note.
The dollar was 0.1 percent higher against the yen at 110.610 yen, though it was sticking within a narrow range ahead of the Federal Reserve minutes that could give fresh clues on central bank's rate hike plans.
In commodities, Brent oil futures were on the rise again at $78.30 a barrel, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet demanding that OPEC reduce prices for crude. 
Brent had risen on Wednesday on a threat from an Iranian commander to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil, and a drop in U.S. crude inventories.

""If Trump continues to believe that OPEC are not doing enough, we would not rule out an SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) release from the U.S., or possibly even export restrictions on petroleum products,"" ING said in a note.

SAN MIGUEL, Argentina (Reuters) - At an abandoned train station in Buenos Aires' working-class suburb of San Miguel, hundreds of Argentines gather with bags of clothes, rice, flour and sugar to trade.
Most are women, some accompanied by children. Cardboard signs with their names scrawled in black marker hang from strings around their necks. They walk slowly around the old concrete platform yelling out the names of people they had agreed to trade with in a forum on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
They are the face of a resurgent but little-reported phenomenon in the suburbs surrounding the Argentine capital – barter clubs. 
The clubs have tens of thousands of members and are attracting hundreds more every week. They have become an unofficial economic indicator, showing the toll that soaring inflation and high unemployment are exacting on South America's second-biggest economy.
The barter clubs have surfaced before, during Argentina's 2001-2002 economic crisis and in the 2009 global financial meltdown. In between those crises they never completely went away, but today the clubs operate differently. Many members are part of Facebook groups where they arrange trades before exchanging goods in person at places like the railway station.
Membership in the clubs has been soaring in recent months as poor Argentines, many of whom have lost their jobs or work off-the-books, struggle to find the cash to make ends meet. They are one sign that progress made by President Mauricio Macri last year in reducing poverty is beginning to reverse. 
The country's inflation rate is running at above 25 percent, and the currency has lost more than 30 percent of its value this year in a financial crisis that economists say will likely trigger a recession.
With unemployment running at 9.1 percent and many salaries chewed up by years of high inflation, members of the barter clubs bring second-hand goods, rice or homemade produce like desserts to trade. 
A chart posted on the San Miguel group's Facebook page outlines a points system for certain goods. It's aimed at ensuring participants feel their trades are fair. 
A 1 kg (2 lb) pack of flour serves as a reference, with a hypothetical value of 30 pesos, or one point. Two packs of flour are worth one bottle of sunflower oil. Four packs of flour is the suggested price for one cake, while three packs can be used to get adult jeans.
When Reuters visited the San Miguel market and one in Merlo, another Buenos Aires suburb, most people seemed to be leaving with food. 
  
HOW ONE FAMILY BARTERS
Cecilia Gómez, whose husband lost his job at a struggling restaurant in February, was among those trading at the market.
""This helps me bring my kids milk, sugar: the things that are most necessary,"" she said.
Her husband spent several months working as a cartonero, the local term for people who sift through trash bins for recyclable goods, before finding a new job at a grocery store last month. He earns just 10,000 pesos ($350) per month, far less than his previous salary. 
Gómez also receives a 1,000 peso-per-month subsidy from a government welfare program for each of her two children, but after paying 3,700 pesos per month for rent and 1,200 pesos for her husband's travel to work, there is not enough cash left for basic goods.
Recently, the 30-year-old housewife saw a post on the San Miguel barter club's Facebook page offering up a pair of boots in exchange for a 0.9 liter bottle cooking oil, two packets of sugar and three packs of crackers. 
Gómez desperately needed the boots and accepted the offer even though she didn't actually have any of the items the poster wanted. 
So she made a post of her own asking for those items, and offering in return some used clothes and a bottle of cologne she had bought for her 9-year-old son that he had never opened. After another member accepted the offer, she made both trades in person at the market. 
She also brought homemade cakes and alfajores, a shortbread-based treat, to trade in exchange for some milk, flour, oil and sugar to bring home. That trade was also arranged on Facebook.
 
'THE MONEY IS NOT ENOUGH' 
Barter clubs are not unique to Argentina. Similar clubs have popped up during economic crises elsewhere, such as in rural Greece in 2015 after Athens defaulted on an International Monetary Fund loan and shut down banks to prevent a run on deposits.
The informal nature of bartering groups in Argentina means their growth is difficult to track.  A spokesman for Argentina's Social Development Ministry declined to comment on the rise in barter clubs.     
But Jesica Galera, founder of a Facebook barter group called 'Cambio x Mercaderia', said her group is receiving 50-60 new members per day. 
""There are many new faces - women whose husbands lost their jobs, or those couples who both work and their wages are not enough,"" said Galera, who founded the 30,000-member group in April 2016.
The victory of Macri's 'Let's Change' coalition in midterm congressional elections last October was due in part to improved support among residents in the sprawling, working-class suburbs of Buenos Aires, where the barter clubs are mostly based. His performance raised the likelihood that Macri would be re-elected in next year's presidential election. 
Since then, however, thousands of Argentines have taken to the streets to protest rises of up to 40 percent in utility bills, part of Macri's plan to cut the government's budget deficit by trimming subsidies for gas and electricity. 
Higher interest rates of up to 40 percent which are meant to stem the fall in the value of the country's currency, the peso, have cut off access to finance for many businesses. More than 5,000 small and mid-sized businesses have closed in the past two years, according to the government.
As the peso lost value against other currencies in recent months, it became more expensive for Argentina to pay its debts, which are largely denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. So Macri turned to the IMF in May for financial help. 
Many in the Buenos Aires area are feeling the pinch from the rise in inflation that has resulted from the currency depreciation.
""The money is not enough,"" said Silvia Aranda, the administrator of a barter club with 46,000 Facebook members in Merlo, a suburb of the river-front capital with more than 500,000 residents. ""Before, we were getting 100 requests to join per day. Now, it is a lot more."" 
        
POVERTY RISING
Rising inflation this year has had the biggest impact on the roughly 20 percent of Argentine workers who work irregular, off-the-books jobs, said Agustin Salvia, a researcher at the Catholic University of Argentina. 
Those workers, who do not benefit from union bargaining agreements that keep salaries above inflation and often find themselves without work during economic slowdowns, make up the bulk of barter club members, Salvia said. 
Data published by Salvia's Argentine Observatory of Social Debt shows that nearly 29 percent of people were below the poverty line in 2017, down from nearly 33 percent in 2016 and nearly 30 percent in 2015, but the same as the nearly 29 percent registered in 2014. Salvia said he expects an increase of 2-3 percentage points in the poverty rate this year.
But Galera, the organizer of the San Miguel market, doesn't need to wait for the new poverty data to know that people are hurting. With more and more people attending her market, she said she plans to ask municipal authorities to grant her a permit for a larger space to trade in.
And housewife Cecilia Gómez will be returning to the market on Friday, again laden with her homemade alfajores. She's hoping to trade them for milk, detergent and ‘yerba,’ the bitter herb base for Argentina’s signature ‘mate’ infusion.
“That is what I need urgently at home,” she said.

The Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), a self-styled ""mid-shore"" special economic zone, hopes to attract players ranging from Chinese state funds to Swiss private banks by offering tax breaks, easy entry and a Common Law court.
The move is part of Kazakhstan's ambition to become a Luxembourg-style intermediary between larger nations and a gateway for foreign investment across Central Asia.
However, it might take months before securities trading actually opens in Astana, and when it does, it will split the oil-rich nation's already minuscule liquidity pool between two stock exchanges.
Modeled on the Dubai International Financial Centre, AIFC wants to host all sorts of market players: family offices, private banks, brokers, asset managers, Islamic finance institutions and fintech companies.
Unlike DIFC though, AIFC will not require that its members maintain physical presence in the windswept Kazakh capital where temperatures range from -40 to +40 Celsius (-40 to 104 Fahrenheit).
It will also charge much lower fees than the established hubs and offer 50-year tax breaks.
Like DIFC, the Astana hub will employ its own court and arbitration center staffed with British judges and barristers.
In fact, it hopes that its dispute resolution services will be used even by outside companies such as regular Kazakh businesses which often complain about ordinary courts' lack of independence and integrity.
An even greater ambition is to serve as an arbitration center for contracts between Chinese and Russian companies, AIFC employees say. Some foreign investors have enquired about the possibility of using AIFC as a platform to invest in Uzbekistan.
CHINESE BACKING
Kazakhstan often refers to itself as the buckle in Beijing's Belt and Road project - Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark scheme to build infrastructure to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond.
China has already demonstrated its support for the AIFC with both the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the state-run Silk Road Fund becoming shareholders of AIFC's Astana International Exchange (AIX) alongside Nasdaq (O:NDAQ).
""The Shanghai Stock Exchange is a 25 percent shareholder and they are contributing staff and resources but more importantly they are providing a gateway for us to talk to Chinese funds, Chinese brokers,"" AIX chief executive Timothy Bennett, who has previously run New Zealand's NZX bourse, told Reuters.
""On the regulatory level one of the big opportunities for us is RMB and the ability to trade, clear and settle in RMB and their help with the regulatory process around that is very beneficial.""
Trading on the new exchange is likely to open in September or October with the listing of one of the three state-controlled companies - Kazakhtelecom (KZ:KZTK), the world's biggest uranium miner Kazatomprom [KZTPR.UL] or flag carrier Air Astana - as part of the government's privatization campaign.
Bennett said AIX would seek to attract active investors rather than chase ratings of index providers such as MSCI which largely drive passive fund flows.
SHALLOW LIQUIDITY
So far, Kazakhstan has little to show for it when it comes to stock market development. Daily equities trading has averaged just $11 million this year on the Almaty-based Kazakh Stock Exchange and most of the large Kazakh companies floated abroad have since delisted for various reasons.
An earlier attempt to create a regional financial hub in Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city, has failed and some of the biggest Kazakh banks had to be bailed out after a property price crash triggered by the 2008 global crisis.
AIX hopes to partly address the liquidity issue by linking up with Euroclear, Europe's largest securities settlement house for securities. The move means that foreigners looking to buy Kazakh securities will no longer need to open accounts with a Kazakh depository.

Still, two stock exchanges in a country of 18 million is ""one too many"", a Western executive said privately as he attended the launch event which took place on the eve of the 78th birthday of President Nursultan Nazarbayev who has run Kazakhstan since 1989.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 06:49AM ET</span>",U.S. tells German car bosses it could abandon tariff threat: source,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Germany told German car bosses that President Donald Trump could abandon threats to impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union in exchange for concessions, an industry source said on Thursday.
German daily Handelsblatt reported Ambassador Richard Grenell told executives from  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) on Wednesday that Trump would suspend tariff threats if the EU annulled duties on U.S. cars imported into the bloc.
Trump threatened last month to impose a 20-percent import tariff on all EU-assembled vehicles, which could upend the industry's current business model for selling cars in the United States.
German automotive trade body VDA said on Thursday it had repeatedly called for free and fair trade in talks with Ambassador Grenell.
""But it is clear that the negotiations are exclusively being held at a political level,"" it said in a statement.
It said suggestions about mutually removing tariffs and other trade barriers were positive signals. 

Trump's protectionist trade policies, which also target Chinese imports, have raised fears of a full-blown and protracted trade war that threatens to damage the world economy.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks fell on Thursday and the yuan wavered against the dollar a day before China and the United States were set to hit one another with punitive tariffs that risked triggering a full-scale trade war.
Markets have been on edge ahead of Friday, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products - and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods of the same value - are expected to kick in.
The declines in stocks come the same day the central bank's targeted cut of reserve requirements for banks took effect, which was expected to release additional liquidity into the financial system.
The blue chip CSI300 Index (CSI300) closed down 0.6 percent, and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) ended down 0.2 percent.
""The bottom for A-shares is nowhere in sight yet,"" said Samuel Chien, partner of Shanghai BoomTrend Investment Management Co. The hedge fund house currently has no long positions in China A-shares, or yuan-denominated mainland stocks.
""Whether you look at fundamental factors, or market psychology, there's nothing bright - a Sino-U.S. trade war will have a seriously negative impact on China's economy. There could be a market rebound, but I don't want to make that sort of money, it's too dangerous.""
As A-shares fell, Chinese treasury futures advanced before giving up ground later in the day. Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most-traded contract, rose as much as 0.28 percent in early afternoon trade, before settling up 0.06 percent at 95.840.
The yuan  made late gains after earlier declines, but was mostly flat on Thursday afternoon. The currency ended the onshore trading session slightly weaker, at 6.6372 per dollar after ending the late night session at 6.6330.
The yuan's midpoint  was set within market expectations, according to traders, but volume shrank on Thursday morning as investors went into a holding pattern on the eve of the tariff implementation on Friday.
Daily trading volume  dipped to $7.951 billion as of 0324 GMT, about half of normal volume.
In June, the yuan suffered its worst month on record, falling 3.3 percent against the dollar.
""The yuan is likely to continue range-bound trading before Friday,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank.
The reserve requirement cut, which was announced on June 24, releases about 700 billion yuan ($105.5 billion) in liquidity, the People's Bank of China said on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - A strong rise across autos boosted European shares on Thursday, as hopes over a softening in U.S. trade rhetoric lifted the sector, though trading remained cautious ahead of a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.4 percent by 0859 GMT, while Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) rose 1 percent, supported by autos.
European stocks have traded in a narrow range this week in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports set to go into effect on Friday.
Sectors which have been particularly hit by the uncertainty over the trade rift made some headway on Thursday, with autos (SXAP) jumping 3.2 percent, while basic resources (SXPP) rose 1.3 percent and banks (SX7P) were up 1.1 percent.
German autos BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_P) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were among the biggest STOXX risers, up as much as 4.7 percent following a report about a U.S. offer to suspend threats to impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union.
""The damage potentially may have already been done with some of these downturns, with some of these stocks, and now is a good time to make a few value plays under the assumption that these trade tariffs might not actually come to fruition,"" Jasper Reimers, market analyst at Vertex Capital Group, said.
""With the deadline tomorrow for trade tariffs, there's clearly a lot of buying into this market at the moment.""
Autos have struggled in 2018 and remain down 8 percent for the year, among the worst-performing sectors in Europe.
Europe's tech sector (SX8P), which came under pressure in the previous session after a Chinese court banned U.S. peer Micron (O:MU) selling chips, regained ground with a 1 percent rise.
Elsewhere, company updates were in focus. Shares in France's Sodexo (PA:EXHO) were one of the biggest STOXX 600 gainers, up 5.2 percent after the food services and facilities management group maintained its full-year goals despite posting slower third-quarter sales growth.
However, shares in Primark-owner Associated British Foods (L:ABF) slid around 5 percent after the company warned again on the outlook for its sugar business, though it maintained its overall guidance for the full-year. 

SBM Offshore (AS:SBMO) was the biggest faller, down nearly 7 percent after a Brazilian court ordered Petrobras (SA:PETR4) to provisionally withhold some payments to SBM to ensure the Dutch company paid whatever penalties it received in a corruption case.

Linde and Praxair (NYSE:PX) need to sell assets to get regulatory approval for their $83 billion all-share merger of equals that will create a global leader in gas distribution, with revenues of almost $29 billion and 88,000 staff. 
""We are taking a constructive approach to address regulatory concerns with the merger in the European Economic Area,"" Praxair CEO Steve Angel said in a statement on Thursday. 
Linde shares rose 4.2 percent after the Taiyo Nippon Sanso deal was announced, and were among top gainers on the DAX index of leading German shares. 
Taiyo Nippon Sanso will pay 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) for the Praxair European assets, which generated annual sales of approximately 1.3 billion euros in 2017, in a move aimed at boosting its global competitiveness.
""With this acquisition, we are seizing a unique opportunity to enter the European market and establish a truly global footprint through the purchase of highly attractive assets in all the key geographies in the European Union,"" Taiyo Nippon Sanso President CEO Yujiro Ichihara said.
Sources previously told Reuters that Taiyo Nippon Sanso would likely buy the European assets that the two groups were trying to unload to satisfy regulators. Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP was in the running to buy their U.S. assets worth about $3.3 billion, they said.
Linde said in a statement that more disposals were planned in a bid to complete the Praxair merger this year.
""Linde and Praxair are in discussions with the competent authorities and in negotiations with potential bidders with the objective of completing the business combination in the second half of 2018,"" it said in a statement on Thursday.
A combined Linde and Praxair would have the size to overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA in the supply of gases such as oxygen and helium to industries worldwide.
Praxair said the assets to be sold include its industrial gases businesses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain, and include approximately 2,500 employees.
Taiyo Nippon Sanso said the deal depends on the planned Praxair-Linde merger going through.
It said it would pay for the acquisition with cash on hand and loans, and had no plans to conduct equity financing.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities acted as financial advisors to Praxair and McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP as legal advisors. Mizuho Securities acted as primary financial advisors to Taiyo Nippon Sanso and Greenberg Traurig LLP as legal advisors.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 03:32AM ET</span>",Carmaker Jaguar says 'bad Brexit' would mean it could not stay in UK,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said a so-called ""hard Brexit"" would cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing its future operations in the United Kingdom.
""We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees,"" JLR's Chief Executive Ralf Speth said in a statement on Wednesday.
JLR joins a growing list of companies which have raised concerns about potential disruption to business if Britain crashes out of the bloc next March without a trading agreement with the European Union, a so-called hard Brexit. 
""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK Industry is in no-one's interest,"" JLR's Indian parent firm  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO) said in a statement https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/8cbd16d7-4768-49b6-b752-85dcec2fbf45.pdf on Thursday.
Shares in Tata plunged to their lowest in more than five years on Thursday, as investors turned jittery on the company, whose biggest business is JLR, which contributed nearly 77 percent of its total revenue in the year ended March 31, 2018.
""Prima facie, 1.2 billion pounds looks on the higher side and hence the reaction to the stock today,"" said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst with Ambit Capital.
Speth's comments come ahead of a meeting on Friday between Prime Minister Theresa May and her cabinet ministers to decide on strategy for Britain to negotiate its way out of the European Union, ending a 40-year trading relationship.
Because of uncertainty about what Britain actually wants from the EU after it leaves, the outcome of the cabinet meeting is seen as critical to progress in talks with the EU on the issue. 
Recent weeks have seen criticism of the government by some of the biggest companies operating in Britain. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) and Siemens (NS:SIEM) last week went public with their fears about what leaving the EU customs union and single market would mean for their businesses. 
JLR said it needed ""free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.
""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than 1.2 billion pounds in profit each year. As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around 50 billion pounds in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further 80 billion pounds more in the next five,"" Speth said in a statement.
""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""

654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 02:51AM ET</span>",What the failed Glencore-Tohoku coal talks mean for the market,"By Yuka Obayashi and Henning Gloystein
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Electric utilities in Japan and other Asian countries are driving blind when it comes to coal prices after the failure of Japan's Tohoku Electric and  Glencore  to agree on an annual thermal coal contract that is used to set prices for the region.
Tohoku Electric (T:9506), a major Japanese utility, and Glencore (L:GLEN), the world's biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, abandoned the talks last month on their annual Australian supply contract.
""Both parties seem to have tried hard to come to a consensus but always had large difference in price expectations this year,"" energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a note to clients.
Coal prices spiked as Japanese and Asian utilities jumped into the spot market to cover their needs after the talks broke down. 
Companies that were relying on the talks to set a price for their previously delivered cargoes and future shipments under their April to March contracts now lack a reference for netting out prior payments based on temporary prices.
The collapse of this year's talks has raised questions about the industry's dependence on this method of setting prices. 
For graphic on Australian thermal coal price hits $120/ton click https://reut.rs/2INPBls
WHAT WENT WRONG?
Japan's utilities, which buy about 40 percent of Australia's thermal coal exports, have a relationship with Glencore and its predecessors that goes back over 30 years.
The two sides typically sit down early in the year to negotiate fixed prices for annual supplies for April to March.
Those prices are published by media and used by utilities in Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia for their own contracts. 
However, during the talks this year, spot coal prices rose, making it difficult for the sides to settle on a contract.
""Because Tohoku already signed some deals with smaller suppliers when spot prices were lower, they were not willing to pay significantly more for coal from their biggest supplier, Glencore,"" said one source with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly about commercial deals.
""Glencore had the opposite view. They were unwilling to agree to a supply deal significantly below spot market prices,"" the source added.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Without this year's deal, utilities need to find another reference price for their annual supplies or they can buy in the spot market.
Finding another benchmark is difficult because the coal market is more opaque than other commodities such as crude oil, where exchanges readily publish futures prices.
Rising prices have made going into the spot market expensive.
Spot thermal coal prices at Australia's Newcastle terminal  have climbed by 32 percent from their 2018 lows, to over $120 per ton, the highest since 2012.
But, buying from Newcastle supports Glencore, which exported 49.1 million tonnes of coal from Australia in 2017, a quarter of the country's overseas sales, according to government and company data. 
WHAT'S NEXT?
Market participants are divided on the industry's next steps.
Some traders expect another Japanese utility to become an alternative negotiator for this year, or Tohoku will renew negotiations for another term contract as it wants to reduce its exposure to the volatile spot market.
Others expect the failed talks to mark a more significant change.
""Power market liberalization in Japan now demands that utilities have more flexibility in coal prices in their ability to pass-on fuel costs,"" Wood Mackenzie said.
National Australia Bank said in its July commodity outlook published this week that ""spot prices for thermal coal may become increasingly important, given the breakdown of the traditional Japanese financial year contract mechanism."" 
Some Japanese companies are improving their ability to operate in the spot market.
JERA, a joint-venture between Tokyo Electric Power (T:9502) and Chubu Electric Power (T:9502) and one of the world's biggest fuel importers, has taken over the coal operations of Europe's EDF (PA:EDF) Trading and plans to buy its liquefied natural gas operations.
JERA President Yuji Kakimi said the company has reduced its coal requirements using long-term contracts to only a few percent from as much as 80 percent a decade ago. 
Another option is to use spot price indexes. Japan's steel sector moved to this model last year after Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal (T:5401) ended their decades-old fixed price mechanism settled through talks with Australian miners for coking coal. 

However, a senior official at Glencore said ""that is not what we desire to happen.""

658,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>","Bar by bar, Heineken battles AB Inbev in Brazil","By Tatiana Bautzer, Philip Blenkinsop and Gram Slattery
SAO PAULO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sao Paulo bar owner Arthur Santi has long served up boatloads of ice-cold Skol, one of Brazil's most popular beer brands and a mainstay of brewing giant Ambev SA (SA:ABEV3).
Then last year, rival  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN) made him an offer he could not turn down. Santi was launching another saloon in the same working-class neighborhood. The Dutch brewer wanted top billing for its products at the new location.
Heineken paid him 90,000 reais ($23,000) for a three-year commitment to sell Heineken as its only big-name premium beer. The company also threw in new refrigerators, tables and chairs, all emblazoned with its familiar green logo with the red star.
Bar by bar, Heineken is fighting for a bigger share of the world's third-largest beer market and an end to Ambev's dominance in Brazil.
While beer consumption has stagnated in much of the world, growth is still forecast for Latin America's largest economy, which is why Brazil has become a key battleground for global brewers. 
Heineken made a big move last year with its $1.2 billion purchase of the money-losing Brazil operations of Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (T:2503). That transaction doubled Heineken's market share to nearly 20 percent.
But to catch Ambev, which still controls nearly two-thirds of the action here, Heineken has opened a multi-pronged front. 
The company is aggressively marketing its products in bars and street corner watering holes, spots where convivial Brazilians guzzle nearly half of the nation's beer annually.
And it is trying to plug holes in its strategy, both geographically and in terms of product offerings, according to interviews with several executives, analysts, consultants, distributors and bar owners. 
The company is pushing hard into Brazil's vast northeast, home to one-third of the nation's 210 million people. While one of Brazil's poorest areas, it is home to a number of sizeable cities, including Salvador, Fortaleza and Recife.
Heineken is also focusing on the mainstream market throughout the country, according to Marc Busain, the company's Americas chief.
Prior to the Kirin deal, the company had beers at the high and low ends of the market, but little in between. It now plans to promote its mid-tier offerings, including Devassa, a mark acquired from Kirin, and Amstel, a Heineken brand that has been in Brazil only since 2015.
""Today we have a portfolio that allows us to play in all segments that matter in Brazil,"" Busain said. ""We have plans to transform Brazil into one of Heineken's top markets.""
The Brazil duel is a microcosm of a wider global jousting match between Ambev's parent company  Anheuser-Busch InBev  NV (BR:ABI), the world's largest beer maker with $56 billion in annual revenue, and Heineken, the No. 2 player, with $25 billion, based on current exchange rates.
If InBev is worried about its Brazil lead evaporating, CEO Carlos Brito is not showing it. A native of Rio de Janeiro, he sounded unfazed at a March news conference where he discounted Heineken as an immediate threat on his home turf.
""Most of their business today, volume-wise, is on the value side,"" Brito said. ""It's too early in the process.""
(For a graphic on the Brazil beer market, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2trxCwv)
'UNDER-REPRESENTED'
Brazil is already Heineken's largest market in volume terms, Busain said in a telephone interview. He said the company hopes that within two to three years Brazil will produce profits on a par with Mexico and Vietnam, the brewer’s biggest money-spinners.
Some analysts are skeptical of that sunny projection.
Heineken's margins will be constrained by its small market share, says Andrew Holland, beverage analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), given that economies of scale in marketing, distribution and procurement are only available to high-volume breweries. 
He sees Heineken's operating profit in Brazil at less than half the level in Mexico and Vietnam by 2020. Heineken is still No. 2 in both those countries, but the gap between it and the market leader is much narrower than in Brazil.
""What they are doing is transitioning from, effectively, a niche player into a full portfolio player, and the challenge then is to gain market share,"" Holland said.
To that end, Heineken is banking on winning new customers in the northeast, defined as the states of Ceara, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia. Per-capita beer consumption there is half what it is Brazil's prosperous southeast, home to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
But northeast incomes are low, an average of just $4,500 a year, while sugarcane rum known as cachaça is the favored tipple. Some home-brewed varieties sell for as little as $2 for a liter bottle.
""You can find cachaça cheaper than beer, which is insane,"" said Didier Debrosse, the Frenchman who has led Heineken in Brazil for the past five years. 
To reach these consumers, Heineken's bargain-priced Schin brand, which it acquired from Kirin, has spent an estimated 100 million reais since 2015 sponsoring the famous carnival celebration in Salvador.
The company is also upgrading a brewery in Bahia state to make a wider range of beers, including its premium Heineken. And it may shrink bottle sizes in the region to lower prices, said Mauricio Giamellaro, Heineken's vice president of Brazilian sales. 
COKE FEMSA BATTLE
Another challenge is distribution. 
Since Heineken entered Brazil in 2010, through its purchase of the brewing business of Mexico's Femsa (MX:FMSAUBD), its products have been distributed by Femsa's bottling unit Coca-Cola Femsa (MX:KOFL). 
Heineken wants to end that contract, which runs through mid-2022, and build out the distribution system it acquired from Kirin. 
But the association of Coca-Cola distributors in Brazil is fighting the termination through an arbitration proceeding.
Nevertheless, Heineken has begun upgrading its network. Since last year, it has built six new distribution centers throughout the country, bringing its total to 29. 
""The sales system has to be 100 percent focused on beer,"" CEO Jean-Francois van Boxmeer told shareholders earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Heineken continues to woo Brazilian bar owners, whose patrons are responsible for 45 percent of the nation's beer consumption.
Santi, the Sao Paulo bar owner, says business is so good he has expanded his newest bar, named Lazy Park. Heineken threw in an extra 50,000 reais to help him furnish it.
""They offered us a good deal,"" Santi said. ""It made sense to sell Heineken.""

The two planemakers have been discussing for months a transaction in which a new company controlled by Boeing would be created and focused on commercial aviation. Embraer would keep its defense division and possibly its business jet unit.
A Brazilian air force official defended the deal between the two planemakers from the criticism of lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, suggesting the government's concerns about a deal have subsided.
Air Force Commander Lt Brig Nivaldo Luiz Rossato said the proposed deal would ""preserve national sovereignty,"" by keeping Brazilian defense programs out of the hands of the U.S. company, according to the congressional news service.
The companies said in April that they were discussing the creation of a new company with Embraer's airliner business, leaving out its defense unit and ""potentially"" its business jet division.
Embraer said this week that talks were ongoing and any deal would need the approval of Brazil's government and regulators.
Workers Party Congressman Carlos Zarattini called such a deal a ""crime against the homeland,"" questioning how the government, which can veto the deal, could let Boeing take control of the crown jewel of Brazil's aerospace industry.
Rossato argued that the U.S.-Brazil partnership could actually preserve jobs at Embraer, which is wrapping up development on two major new families of aircraft and has not announced any other major investments.

Embraer shares rose nearly 4 percent in Sao Paulo on Wednesday amid rising speculation that a deal could be announced soon. The stock has gained about 35 percent so far this year.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) premiered its first original series in India in a sheen of Bollywood glitter on Wednesday, upping the stakes in its battle with streaming rival Amazon Prime (O:AMZN) for a chunk of the country's more than 1 billion potential viewers. 
The success of original U.S. shows like ""House of Cards,"" ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""Stranger Things"" has been at the heart of Netflix’s seduction of 125 million subscribers globally. 
But like other U.S. entertainment firms, it has identified the need to create local content as important in winning viewers in some of the big emerging markets which are likely to dominate growth over the next decade. 
A Hindi-language thriller set in Mumbai, ""Sacred Games"" launches less than a month after the success of its Indian film ""Lust Stories"" and comes at a time when fellow U.S. heavyweights Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) are vying for control of Indian pay TV network Tata Sky as part of their fight for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA).
Both ""Lust Stories"" and ""Sacred Games"" seek to marry the Western styles and values that exposure to Netflix and Amazon has brought to younger Indians with the rich and varied output of the country’s massive domestic film industry. 
Netflix is spending $8 billion this year on original content and has said that figure will rise as it seeks to cement its position at the head of the streaming industry globally. The company’s international streaming revenue grew over 58 percent last year, according to latest filings. With China’s heavily censored market proving a hard nut to crack, India is at the heart of that growth. Netflix plans to release another three original shows there this year compared to Amazon’s planned 10 while both have also been battling to sign some of the country’s leading stand-ups for specials. 
An action-driven police procedural that will also be familiar to foreign viewers, ""Sacred Games"" is anchored by Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan as a policeman with 25 days to head off a terrorist threat to Mumbai. It is directed by Bollywood veteran Anurag Kashyap and also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. 
""Sacred Games"" outlines the life of a police officer, Sartaj Singh, tipped by an anonymous call one morning promising him an opportunity to capture the powerful criminal Ganesh Gaitonde.
As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there is a lot more at stake in the game than initially seemed.

The film's stars and directors, all well known veterans of India's huge Bollywood film system, greeted more than 250 specially invited Netflix fans and celebrities outside tech capital Bengaluru's Forum Mall for the premiere.

Six people including two former HBOS bankers were jailed last year for a combined 47 years for their role in the fraud, in which the conspirators enriched themselves at the expense of the bank's business clients.
The compensation shows how Lloyds is still suffering from past misconduct, a decade on from the financial crisis and as its Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio attempts to turn investors and customers' focus from past misdeeds to the bank's new strategy.
""The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods,"" Nicky Morgan, chair of the cross-party Treasury Committee, said on Thursday.
Morgan also called on Linda Dobbs, the retired judge probing whether Lloyds properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009, to speed up her inquiry after Dobbs said it would likely take until the end of 2019 to complete.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is separately conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud.

The Griggs review has identified a total of 187 individual former directors of companies affected by the HBOS Reading fraud, the letters published on Thursday show, meaning the final compensation figure is likely to be higher as those remaining are made offers.

665,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>","As Japan Dumps Treasuries, It's Piling Into Riskier U.S. Assets","(Bloomberg) -- It’s easy to see why Japan has soured on Uncle Sam.
After all, returns on Treasuries have been lousy for years. And the sky-high costs to hedge the dollar’s ups and downs mean Japanese investors can often do better at home -- despite the minuscule yields there.
But it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on America altogether. In fact, investors from Japan have plowed record amounts into U.S. stocks, corporate bonds and agency-backed securities, pushing investments in those assets past $1 trillion for the first time ever this year. That’s a stark contrast to the big pullback from Treasuries, which has cut Japan’s holdings to a seven-year low.
The shift reflects a sea change in Japanese investing. For decades, the U.S. Treasury market has been the go-to destination for the nation’s historically risk-averse investor base. Faced with ultra-low returns in Japan, the yield pickup from owning the world’s pre-eminent haven asset was a no-brainer, and more than covered any currency-hedging costs. But now, as those expenses soar, traditional Japanese buyers of Treasuries such as pension funds and insurers have been forced to look elsewhere.
“The rising hedge cost has pushed Japanese investors out of their favorite foreign product: U.S. Treasuries,” said Tetsuo Ishihara, a U.S. macro strategist at Mizuho Securities USA’s fixed-income unit. “In general, they have had to take more risk to offset that rise.”
Fiscal Consequence
The consequences could be significant. With the U.S. budget deficit forecast to balloon in coming years, any drop-off in demand for Treasuries could increase America’s financing costs. As the second-largest foreign creditor to the U.S., Japan’s standing is too important to simply ignore.
At the same time, Japanese investors are building up risk -- echoing the demand for higher-yielding assets globally in response to ultra-low rates of the post-crisis era -- just as worries about both stocks and corporate bonds in the U.S. have started to emerge.
Since 2015, Japan’s investments in U.S. stocks, corporate bonds and agency-backed bonds have grown by over $270 billion, or roughly 40 percent, figures from the Treasury Department show. Investors from Japan have been particularly aggressive in amassing stocks and agencies, relative to buyers from other countries, the data show. Over the same span, their holdings of Treasuries have fallen nearly 20 percent to $1.03 trillion.
Vanishing Yield
To understand why, consider what Treasuries actually yield for a typical Japanese investor. After taking into account the cost of currency forwards used to insulate buyers against dollar swings, 10-year yields -- currently at 2.83 percent -- effectively shrink to about 0.3 percent for yen-based investors.
Of course, that’s still higher than the yield on 10-year JGBs, which is barely above zero. But looking solely at yield levels arguably misses the point that matters most: what the trade returns after factoring in currency swings.
And this year, it hasn’t been pretty.
Japanese investors who hedged their currency risk lost 3.7 percent in 10-year Treasuries in the first half of the year, according to bond indexes compiled by Intercontinental Exchange. For those who decided not to worry about currency fluctuations? They lost 4.3 percent in yen terms as the dollar weakened against Japan’s currency. (For comparison, JGBs due in five years or more all have positive returns.)
While buyers of U.S. government debt can always hold to maturity (and thus insulate themselves from the market’s fluctuations), the scant interest that Treasuries provide offers little cushion against price declines.
Mortgage Preference
Hence the rotation into other U.S. assets. For Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities, hedged investors can expect to earn 0.9 percent. Almost all of Japan’s roughly $250 billion in agency holdings are in mortgage bonds, and Robert W. Baird’s Kirill Krylov says that Ginnie Mae’s explicit government guarantee makes them a popular choice for Japanese buyers.
Investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds yield about 1.5 percent on a hedged basis, index data compiled by Bloomberg show. As for stocks, the costs don’t apply because Japanese investors tend not to hedge equities, says Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank’s chief international economist. Japan owns over a half trillion dollars of U.S. equities, the largest holding apart from Treasuries.
While the math alone makes a compelling case, stronger global growth has also coaxed Japanese investors into taking more risk, says Zach Pandl, co-head of global FX strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
“The shift away from Treasuries and toward corporates and agencies over the last couple of years reflects improving market conditions and increasing risk tolerance by Japanese investors,” he said.
Yield Pressure
That should be a concern for bond traders and the U.S. Treasury alike, he said. As the sizes of debt auctions swell and the Federal Reserve slowly shrinks its investments of Treasuries, yields have been on the rise.
Since falling as low as 2.01 percent in September, 10-year yields have soared, reaching an almost seven-year high of 3.13 percent in May. If Japan’s shift out of Treasuries continues, that could add to the upward pressure on yields.
Slok paints an even gloomier, if somewhat extreme, picture. With the Fed raising rates, hedging costs are bound to climb too, pushing more investors into other U.S. markets. Add to that increased debt supply and the risk of inflation overshooting the Fed’s 2 percent target, and those buyers may abandon Treasuries altogether.
“The risks are that Japanese investors, and foreign investors more broadly, will simply step away and stop buying U.S. fixed income because it just becomes too risky,” Slok said.

666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Malaysia’s Stocks Selloff Has Investors Sniffing for Bargains,"(Bloomberg) -- A $33 billion selloff in Malaysian stocks since Mahathir Mohamad’s election has got Nikko Asset Management on the hunt for bargains.
Some of the nation’s banks, consumer and healthcare stocks have now fallen to attractive levels, according to Kenneth Tang, a fund manager at the $220 billion Japanese investor.
“Companies that we have always wanted to own and felt that valuations were the only issue are now coming back in our favor,” Tang said in a recent telephone interview. “This is a good opportunity to get back into some of these growth proxies.”
In a one-two punch for Malaysian investors, Mahathir’s surprise election ignited concern about the country’s fiscal policies just as a resurgent dollar and higher U.S. yields sparked a slump in global emerging markets. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has fallen about 9 percent since he was sworn in as prime minister on May 10, and foreign investors have withdrawn $1.8 billion from the market so far this year.
Construction stocks have plunged 27 percent since the election as the government reviews its infrastructure spending. State-linked phone carrier Telekom Malaysia Bhd. has tumbled 44 percent.
However, like Nikko, others now believe the declines have gone too far. Jalil Rasheed, a managing director at Invesco Asset Management, says now is a good time for investors to look at domestic-demand plays.
“We are buyers of Malaysia currently as there are pockets of good quality companies trading at attractive valuations,” said Rasheed. “These are companies that are not government linked rather they are mass market consumer companies.”
Consumer firms were among the biggest winners following the new government’s removal of the goods and services tax on June 1, to be replaced with a new sales tax planned for September, according to Mahathir. Nestle Malaysia Bhd. is the top performer in the benchmark since the election with a 43 percent rise and the Bursa Malaysia Consumer Product Index is heading for its best year since 2010.
And for Tushar Mohata, the head of Malaysia research at Nomura Holdings Inc., the country’s banks, which account for 34 percent of the benchmark index, are other obvious beneficiaries of the new government. Public Bank Bhd. and Hong Leong Bank Bhd. are among consumer-focused firms that will benefit from the uptick in consumption, he said.
Still, as the new administration sets its course for reducing government debt and stemming corruption, the uncertainty of whether it will be able to institute reform while meeting fiscal targets is keeping some foreign investors away.
“I don’t know whether they’re ready to give the new administration the benefit of the doubt yet,” said Gerald Ambrose, Chief Executive Officer of Aberdeen Standard Investments Malaysia who helps manage about $3 billion in the country’s equities. “There are so many unanswered questions.”
Lingering Doubts
Toward the end of last month, the cost of insuring Malaysian bonds against default soared past that for India and the Philippines, ranked two levels lower by Moody’s Investors Service. On top of the scrapped goods and services tax, the new government has reinstated fuel subsidies, while Maybank Kim Eng Securities has estimated it may cost as much as $8.6 billion to service state fund 1MDB’s debt from 2019 to 2023.
Nevertheless, there’s also a risk to investors from avoiding the stock market, according to Arthur Kwong, head of Asia Pacific equities at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
“Of course you want more details, you want more clarity, more action,” said Kwong. “The more you see, the more you will be convinced, but the more you see, the more the market has already moved up.”

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Wednesday he expects to see the first results of the company's new majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jetliner program within weeks, around the time of the Farnborough Air Show later this month.
""I'm convinced we'll see first results already in the next couple of weeks,"" Enders told employees at a CSeries plane factory near Montreal.
Asked later about CSeries orders, Enders told reporters there might be something to see in time for the industry's flagship event, the Farnborough Air Show, which begins on July 16. 
He did not elaborate on whether this meant new firm orders for the 110- to 130-seat planes.
Airbus SE (PA:AIR) took a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries after completing a tie-up with the Canadian train and plane maker on Sunday.
Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its key commercial jet for a token fee of one Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales, high costs and low production rates pushed the plane program well over budget.
Enders repeated comments from 2017 that he expects to sell ""thousands"" of CSeries aircraft, although neither he nor plane program head Philippe Balducchi would give specific figures for new orders in 2018.
Balducchi told employees the European planemaker would have to ""drastically cut costs,"" reiterating the company's plan to bring down the cost structure of CSeries production.
While Airbus is expected to put pressure on CSeries suppliers to lower costs, Enders did not give specifics on whether there could be employee cutbacks.
""We're at the start of this partnership,"" he said. 
Enders also told reporters he is worried that an escalation in a U.S. trade dispute with other countries could trigger retaliation that could impact air traffic. ""Of course we're worried if this escalates,"" Enders said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum from Europe, Canada and other countries, sparking retaliation.

The World Trade Organization said in a report on Wednesday that trade barriers being erected by major economies could jeopardize the global economic recovery and their effects are already starting to show. Enders, however, added that he was “very encouraged to see that more and more American companies are speaking up against the trade policy of the White House. I believe that will have an impact.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police arrested a senior  General Electric  Co (N:GE) executive on Wednesday, as part of a sprawling investigation into fraud in medical equipment tenders overseen by health authorities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, police and prosecutors said.
In addition to the arrest of GE's chief executive for Latin America, Daurio Speranzini Jr., prosecutors said federal police were carrying out 21 arrest warrants as part of the investigation, which concerns a trauma institute known as Into and involves some 37 companies.
The investigation, code-named ""Operation Resonance,"" is the latest fraud and corruption probe in Brazil, where the arrest of high-ranking political and business figures has become a matter of routine, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.
Speranzini was previously the head of Philips Medical Systems in Brazil. Frederik Knudsen, who prosecutors said was a sales supervisor at Philips in Brazil during the period under investigation, was also among the people police were seeking to arrest.
In a document sent to a federal court and seen by Reuters, prosecutors said there ""exists robust proof of participation"" by Speranzini and Knudsen in corruption, bid rigging, and criminal conspiracy.
In addition to the arrests, police said they executed 44 search warrants on Wednesday, which included buildings occupied by Philips and U.S. multinational Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ).
A federal court also ordered some 1.2 billion reais ($307 million) in assets to be frozen.
It was not immediately possible to contact Speranzini or Knudsen.
GE said in a statement that with regard to the police operation ""that resulted in the temporary imprisonment of Daurio Speranzini Jr., we clarify that the allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a different company.""
It added, ""GE emphasizes that it is not the target of the investigation. The company believes that the facts will be clarified by the courts and the company is at the disposition of the authorities to cooperate.""
Koninklijke Philips NV (AS:PHG) (AS:PHG), as Philips is formally known, said in a statement the company's current leaders were not involved in the police operation and that the firm was cooperating with authorities.
Philips ""still doesn't have access to the official accusations; however, the company is cooperating with the authorities to offer all clarifications regarding the allegations, that go back many years,"" the company said, adding that the ""current head executives of Philips are not part of the federal police operation.""
Johnson & Johnson said it ""vigorously followed"" Brazilian law and was ""cooperating fully"" with the investigation.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",WPP warns Sorrell he could lose payout over M&A clash: source,"By Kate Holton and Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell is at risk of losing his multi-million pound exit package from WPP (L:WPP) after his new advertising venture sought to buy a business that his former employer is also pursuing, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
WPP lawyers have written to the 73-year-old to warn him he is at risk of losing share awards that could be worth 20 million pounds ($26.5 million) if he breaches confidentiality obligations, the person said. 
The letter comes as WPP competes with Sorrell's new venture, S4 Capital, in the race to buy Dutch digital agency Mediamonks. Sorrell left WPP without a non-compete clause. 
A source close to S4 Capital said it viewed the letter as a mischievous attempt to disrupt its bid. The source added that investors in S4 were aware of the issue and the company had taken legal advice. 
Sorrell left WPP in April and then announced his comeback just six weeks later with a plan to return to the London stock market through a reverse takeover involving listed shell Derriston Capital and S4 in a deal that is yet to complete. 
He said at the time that he planned to “build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth” and it has since emerged that he is pursuing Mediamonks which could be worth at least 250 million euros ($292 million). 
Sorrell, one of Britain’s most high-profile businessmen who founded WPP, quit the advertising group after the FTSE 100 company said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct made against him. 
Sorrell denied subsequent reports he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when asked about his exit from WPP at the Cannes Lions advertising festival last month. 
Derriston said on Wednesday it was asking permission from investors to issue as many as 1 billion shares at a minimum price of 1 pound-a-share that it would use to buy S4. It wants the authority to issue the shares in case Sorrell has grown S4 through acquisitions before the reverse takeover with Derriston has gone through. 

Sorrell is expected to inherit the ability to issue the shares, if they have not all already been required as part of the reverse takeover, once he takes charge of the business, a spokesman for Derriston said.

Passenger car sales declined 8 percent in June to 61,153 units, according to research DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. 
Meanwhile, light truck sales rose 1.4 percent to 139,003 units, accounting for about 69 percent of overall sales.
David Adams, President of the Global Automakers of Canada, said this could still be another record year for auto sales in Canada, despite certain hurdles including the tariffs imposed on imports of steel and aluminum by the Trump administration.
Higher tariffs could push up vehicle prices and so reduce sales.
""Given the current economic and political uncertainty, these sales levels are quite strong,"" Adams said. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) said it sold 27,638 vehicles in Canada in June, up 1.8 percent from a year earlier.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported a 4.8 percent fall in sales to 31,179 units, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (N:FCAU) sales slumped 16.5 percent, according to the DesRosiers report.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers gave approval on Wednesday for the European Investment Bank (EIB) to do business in Iran, overcoming a blocking attempt and keeping alive plans to save the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that Washington has abandoned.
The EIB, the European Union's not-for-profit long term investment arm, is a key pillar of the bloc's attempts to maintain business links with Iran in the face of Washington's decision to re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. 
However, the EU lawmakers' decision does not oblige the EIB to work with Iran, a move that could jeopardize its ability to raise money on U.S. markets and so have far reaching consequences for its operations. 
The European Parliament overwhelmingly blocked a motion by far-right lawmakers seeking to prevent the European Commission from lifting restrictions on the EIB in Iran, setting the stage for the measure to come into effect at the start of August.
The blocking motion, put forward by the far-right Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group (EFDD) that includes Britain's euroskeptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), failed with only 93 votes for, 573 against and 11 abstentions. 
""We are granting the EIB the capacity to invest in Iran if suitable projects are found,"" said Siegfried Muresan, a lawmaker from the center-right European People's Party (EPP), which led the preparatory discussions on the Commission's proposal. 
""The Iran deal is good for Europe's security,"" he told Reuters, referring to the accord signed by world powers in 2015 that curbs Tehran's ability to develop nuclear weapons.
EU governments can technically still block the Commission proposal but are not expected to do so given EU leaders publicly backed the EIB lending plan at a summit in May.
The parliament's decision is likely to be a morale boost for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who will chair a meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, China, France, Germany and Britain in Vienna on Friday to discuss progress on salvaging the nuclear deal.
Iran requested the meeting to discuss European efforts to protect the nuclear pact in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to pull out and revive Iran-related sanctions, after the expiry of 90- and 180-day periods.
The sanctions start to come into effect in August but some European companies investing in Iran and with big operations in the United States have announced they will pull out of business deals with Tehran.
The pillars of the EU's strategy are: EIB lending, a special measure to shield EU companies from U.S. secondary sanctions and a Commission proposal that EU governments make direct money transfers to Iran's central bank to avoid U.S. penalties. 
However, the Luxembourg-based EIB is concerned about the proposal that it do business in Iran, EU sources told Reuters in June, fearing the threat of U.S. sanctions could imperil its ability to raise funds on U.S. capital markets.
""Maintaining access to these markets is a quasi life-or-death issue for the EIB,"" bank Director General Bertrand de Mazieres told a European Parliament budget committee hearing in late May, saying there were $120 billion of outstanding bonds issued by the EIB worldwide.

The EIB currently steers clear of engaging in jurisdictions listed as high-risk under the FATF, a global group of government anti-money-laundering agencies. That includes Iran.

Handelsblatt said Ambassador Richard Grenell told executives from  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) during a meeting that in exchange Trump wanted the EU to annul duties on U.S. cars imported to the bloc.
Trump threatened last month to impose a 20-percent import tariff on all EU-assembled vehicles, which could upend the industry's current business model for selling cars in the United States.
Handelsblatt cited people present at the meeting, which took place at the U.S. embassy in Berlin on Wednesday. It said the chief executives of Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen - Dieter Zetsche, Harald Krueger and Herbert Diess respectively - were in attendance.
Daimler and Volkswagen declined to comment. BMW was not immediately available for comment.
A spokeswoman for the German Economy Ministry also declined to comment on the report, saying issues related to the trade dispute with the United States were being handled by the European Commission in Brussels on behalf of EU member states.
A European Commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. She said Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker would discuss trade during talks with Trump in Washington later this month.
""This will be an opportunity to discuss the many issues of common interest, notably also relating to trade,"" the spokeswoman said.
Current U.S. import tariff rates on cars are 2.5 percent and on trucks 25 percent. The EU has a 10 percent levy on car imports from the United States.
Trump hit the EU, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum at the start of June, ending exemptions that had been in place since March.
The EU executive responded by imposing its own import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. goods, including steel and aluminum products, farm produce such as sweetcorn and peanuts, bourbon, jeans and motor-bikes.
Trump's protectionist trade policies, which also target Chinese imports, have raised fears of a full-blown and protracted trade war that threatens to damage the world economy.

679,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 01:49PM ET</span>",China's HNA Chairman Wang dies in France after falling from a wall,"By Se Young Lee and Jean-Francois Rosnoblet
BEIJING/MARSEILLE, France (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] Co-Chairman Wang Jian died during a business trip in France on July 3 in what local police said appeared to be an accidental fall from a wall while posing for a photograph.
Wang, 57, is regarded as the architect of an eye-popping $50 billion acquisition spree that saw HNA accumulate assets ranging from a stake in  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) to high-profile overseas properties. Under pressure from Beijing, HNA has since sold off many of those assets to slash debt.
He was in charge of HNA's strategy and ran day-to-day operations, sources familiar with the matter have said, while his fellow chairman and co-founder Chen Feng was often the public face of the group.
His death complicates the troubled conglomerate's efforts to restructure and pay off borrowings, and could increase pressure on HNA to reveal more about its oft-criticized opaque ownership. 
Wang fell 15 meters off a wall in the village of Bonnieux, near Avignon, a picturesque area popular with tourists, lieutenant-colonel Hubert Meriaux of the Vaucluse gendarmerie force told Reuters.
""He stood on the edge of a sharp drop to get his family to take a picture of him and fell,"" he said.
Wang held a 15 percent stake in HNA. The group is controlled by a New York-based foundation and a China-based charity that together hold 52 percent of HNA shares. Chen also holds a 15 percent stake.
Shareholders have promised that in the event of leaving the company or dying they would pass their stakes to the New York charity fund, according to a document seen by Reuters. It was not immediately clear how binding those promises were. 
An aviation-to-financial services conglomerate that counts Hainan Airlines Co as its core asset, HNA's recent sales include holdings in companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, Park Hotels & Resorts and Spain's NH Hotels. 
Wang's death couldn't have come at a worse time, said Brock Silvers, founder and managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.
""Deleveraging pressures on HNA continue to be enormous, and all such plans will probably now be revisited as the management team reconstitutes itself,"" he said.
Wang told employees earlier this year that the company's difficulties were the result of a ""major conspiracy"" against the ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping by foreign and domestic ""reactionary forces"", according to an internally-distributed email.
However, the embattled group appeared to have won a reprieve of sorts recently, when at a meeting held by China's central bank, lenders were told to ""support"" HNA bonds, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported last month.
CONGLOMERATE CLAMPDOWN
HNA has remained in selling mode: last month, Hainan Airlines said it would offload its stake in Brazilian airline Azul SA, worth around $324 million.
And this week, HNA canceled its A$280 million ($207 million) debt-funded offer to buy the refrigerated trucking arm of Australia's Automotive Holdings Group Ltd. The seller cited cashflow problems at HNA as a factor.
China's clampdown on aggressive overseas deals has also seen the likes of Dalian Wanda Group offloading billions of dollars worth of assets last year, while Anbang Insurance Group [ANBANG.UL] was taken over by the government this year. 
Wang graduated from the Civil Aviation University of China with a degree in airline management and held an MBA from the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands.
""HNA Group extends deepest condolences to Mr. Wang's family and many friends,"" HNA's board and management team said in a statement.
""Together, we mourn the loss of an exceptionally gifted leader and role model, whose vision and values will continue to be a beacon for all who had the good fortune to know him, as well as for the many others whose lives he touched through his work and philanthropy.""
Social media posts about Wang's death appeared to have been censored on China's tightly controlled internet soon after the news was announced by the group. ""HNA Wang Jian died"" briefly ranked 11th on Twitter-like Weibo's hot topics page, but was quickly gone from the top 50.
""It's really shocking news to us,"" said an employee who works in finance at HNA, declining to give his name.
""Everyone in the office is talking about it, but we don't know what impact it will have on the company's direction.""

680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Content-hungry bidders circle 'Big Brother' maker Endemol,"By Arno Schuetze, Douglas Busvine and Pamela Barbaglia
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Several bidders, including Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), are preparing offers for TV production company Endemol Shine, maker of classic reality show 'Big Brother' and the dystopian 'Black Mirror' dramas, before an initial deadline next week.
 ITV  (LON:ITV), RTL Group's FremantleMedia and Lions Gate Entertainment are also eyeing Netherlands-based Endemol, sources close to the matter said, in a deal that comes as the rise of streaming giants Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime has thrown the industry into turmoil.
The sellers are aiming for a price tag of between 2.5 and 3 billion euros ($2.9-$3.5 billion), said one banker familiar with the process, but this may prove ambitious with bids expected to be in the 2-2.5 billion euro range. 
That works out at roughly 10 times core earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which a second banker said would be the most the seller could hope to get.
A source close to one potential buyer said Endemol's catalog was heavy with ageing formats, making it potentially less attractive than buying small production outfits and working directly with top creative talent.
This person, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Endemol carried sizable debts and had already gone through a round of cost cutting, meaning the potential for synergies with an acquirer might be limited.
""We're interested, yes, but skeptical,"" this person said. ""Is Endemol really a creative company any more? It's financially weak.""
Endemol declined to comment. Its owners, private equity firm Apollo Global and Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
HUNGER FOR QUALITY
The sale comes as traditional TV players need more quality scripted serials to fill their fledgling video-on-demand services, with binge-watching online viewers less likely to be satisfied with their staple fare of reality and lifestyle shows.
It also creates an opening for Liberty, the U.S. telecoms and pay-TV company built by John Malone, to leverage its distribution expertise and assets.
Liberty may bid for Endemol via All3Media, the production joint venture it owns together with Discovery Inc, CEO Mike Fries said at a recent industry gathering.
""It would be surprising if we didn't look at it through All3Media,"" Fries told C21 Media, adding Liberty would continue to ""get its feet wet"" through content deals.
Discovery, for its part, has joined forces with Germany's ProSiebenSat 1 Media to build a German streaming TV platform and has invited others to join.
France's Banijay Group, in which  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) owns a minority stake, may also join the contest for Endemol, another source said.
Liberty, Discovery, ITV, Banijay, Vivendi and RTL - controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann - all declined to comment. Los Angeles-based Lionsgate, which has movie and TV divisions, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
Apollo Global and Fox have hired  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Liontree to advise on the deal.
They are ready to sell Endemol outright, although a potential buyer may seek a deal in which Fox retains a minority, said one banker familiar with the process.
Liberty has just agreed the $22 billion sale of its telecoms assets in Germany and central Europe to  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and, assuming the deal clears antitrust scrutiny, will be looking to reinvest some of the proceeds. 

Britain's ITV and ProSieben are more financially constrained and would have to raise cash for a bid, a second banker said, while RTL, the European broadcaster, may lack the appetite for a big deal.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 01:34PM ET</span>",British Supreme Court rejects Goldman Sachs appeal vs Novo Banco,"LISBON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court dismissed on Wednesday an appeal by Goldman Sachs for compensation from Portugal's Novo Banco over a $835 million loan to Novo Banco's bankrupt predecessor, Banco Espirito Santo (BES), which was carved up by the state in 2014. 
The decision, announced by the court on its website, sets a precedent that could help Portugal fend off other lawsuits involving major bondholders in BES, such as Pimco and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), which have challenged similar decisions by the Portuguese central bank in 2015 not to transfer liabilities to Novo Banco.
The loan arranged by Goldman Sachs (N:GS) was extended to BES by Luxembourg-based vehicle Oak Finance in 2014, shortly before the bank went bankrupt under the weight of the debts of its founding family, and Goldman has sought compensation from Novo Banco, which took over the healthy operations of BES.
Britain's Supreme Court said it unanimously rejected the appeal, even though the original loan agreement was governed by English law. Novo Banco declined to comment.
After the collapse of BES in August 2014, Portugal's central bank transferred some assets and liabilities to Novo Banco, which took over BES operations after an injection of about 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of public funds. It was acquired last year by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star.
In December 2014, the central bank specified the Goldman Sachs loan was not eligible for the transfer and had never been transferred, to which Goldman objected. 
The court said it understood ""that an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. It was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause.""
It added there were ongoing administrative law proceedings in Portugal challenging the December 2014 decision, which have not yet been resolved.
A range of other lawsuits by bondholders in BES and Novo Banco also challenge a central bank decision at the end of 2015 to transfer more than 2 billion euros of bonds from the rescued Novo Bank back to BES, which is being liquidated.
London-based hedge fund Winterbrook Capital said last week it considered several notes issued by Novo Banco to be in default as a results of the resolution measures taken by Portugal's central bank in 2014 and 2015. 
Despite the warning, Novo Banco placed 400 million euros worth of subordinated debt notes just two days later on June 29, its first issue since the rescue, to strong investor demand.

Its offering will compete in its home market with DriveNow and Car2Go, the soon-to-be-merged carsharing services of BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn).
Volkswagen said on Wednesday the new carsharing service would be expanded to major cities in Europe, North America and Asia as early as 2020 and focus on core VW brand cars.
VW is seeking to move on from its diesel emissions scandal of 2015, the repercussions of which are still being felt across the German car industry, and focus on greener technologies.
It set up mobility services division Moia in 2016, which focuses on ride hailing and car pooling and which will be complemented by the new carsharing service.
New CEO Herbert Diess, who took office in April, said it was vital for VW ""to pick up speed and make an unmistakable mark"" in areas including new mobility services which VW wants to contribute a significant share to future group business.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) announced plans on Wednesday to launch a ride-hailing and car-sharing scheme covering the French capital and its surrounding areas from September.

Renault and Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP) are vying to offer a car sharing scheme in Paris to replace Autolib, the electric car sharing service run by French tycoon Vincent Bollore's group that was recently ditched by local authorities after a dispute.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's financial regulator is investigating allegations of mismanagement at private equity firm Abraaj, which is on the verge of financial collapse after a scandal over its use of investor money, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has interviewed the firm's founder, Arif Naqvi, and other senior executives in the past few months as part of the probe, the sources said.
The DFSA declined to comment. Abraaj said in a statement discussions between it and the regulator were ""ongoing.""
“The DFSA is kept apprised of developments in the overall Abraaj Group and has our full co-operation on all relevant matters,"" Abraaj said.
""While we do not comment on confidential discussions with our regulators, we are highly focused on strengthening our corporate governance and internal controls.""
A third source said Abraaj co-chief executives Omar Lodhi and Selcuk Yorgancioglu were among those questioned by the regulator. 
There was no immediate comment from Naqvi or his legal representative. There was also no immediate comment from Lodhi. Yorgancioglu referred a Reuters request for comment to Abraaj.
The investigation heaps more pressure on Abraaj which is trying to sell its investment management business to Colony Capital following a dispute with some of its investors over the use of money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.
This erupted late last year, when investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the International Finance Corp made allegations that Abraaj mishandled their money in the healthcare fund. Abraaj has denied misusing the funds.
The allegations triggered a solvency crisis at the fund, the biggest buyout fund in Middle East and North Africa. 
After halting fund raising activities and shaking up management, Abraaj last month filed for provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands as it seeks an agreement with creditors and is selling parts of its businesses. 
Summary findings of a review by Deloitte, appointed by Abraaj to audit its operations, said that a cash shortage at the firm led it to dip into investor funds.
Deloitte said on June 4 there was no evidence of embezzlement or misappropriation, but highlighted a lack of ""adequate governance"" and ""overall weakness"" at Abraaj.
In a statement on June 21, the DFSA had said it would be ""discussing various matters with the Joint Provisional Liquidators of Abraaj Holdings and Abraaj Investment Management Limited and would continue to work toward safeguarding the interests of investors.""
DFSA has the power to fine or ban individuals from working in financial services within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and has in the past imposed penalties for rule breaches. For companies, that can lead to a fine or even a suspension from operating in the center.
Abraaj has a regulated entity, Abraaj Capital, in the DIFC. 
In its statement, Abraaj said it was premature to speculate on actions that the regulator may or may not consider.
“We believe these are decisions best communicated by the regulator in the fullness of time and early speculation is unhelpful to the process,” the statement said.
The affair has raised concerns in the finance industry that Dubai's reputation as a major financial center could suffer.
Dubai’s main stock market index (DFMGI) is down 15 percent so far this year, making it one of the worst performing in the region. The market has been partly affected by the Abraaj situation as well as weakness in the property sector.
""It is easy to fault regulators and auditors in retrospect,"" said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management, adding that it was not easy to detect mismanagement. 
“One might also argue that the investor oversight that brought these issues into the open might prove to be timely.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks treaded water on Wednesday amid growing anxiety ahead of Washington's end of week deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, while the yuan steadied after China's central bank acted to calm investors.
The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was lower by less than 0.1 percent on the day, recovering slightly from a 0.2 percent fall earlier.
Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind on the same day.
Concerns about the outbreak of a global trade war have, among other factors, prevented a sustained recovery in global stock markets since a violent sell-off in February.
The United States has listed another 284 product lines valued at $16 billion that it will target with tariffs, including semiconductors and a broad range of electronics.
U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened tariffs on as much as $400 billion worth of Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs due to go into force on Friday.
Washington has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports, with Trump threatening Europe with a 20 percent tariff on car imports while various countries have also already taken retaliatory steps against U.S. tariffs on steels and aluminum products. 
Over 40 countries have voiced deep concern at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about possible U.S. measures.
""There is a lot of concern I think about the effect a long term trade war might have but actually if you look at the data we're seeing, the economic data is not that bad,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
He noted that most equity markets were well above lows hit earlier this year.
""So it could have a drag, and it will have a drag. But will it push the global economy into recession? Not yet.""
After dipping at the European open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index moved into positive territory by afternoon, up nearly 0.2 percent. Germany's exporter-heavy DAX declined 0.1 percent and the FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent.
A Chinese court temporarily banned Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) from selling chips in China, the world's biggest memory chip market, hitting shares in U.S. stock overnight and Asian semiconductor stocks on Wednesday.
Europe's tech sector was led 0.5 percent lower by falls in chipmakers STMicro and Infineon, which were both down around 2 percent. (EU)
""The biggest risks to the technology sector are regulation and global semiconductor disruption from an escalating trade war,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said.
""At this point, the probabilities for both scenarios having major impacts on the technology sector in the short term are low,"" Garnry said.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.25 percent, a day after it hit a nine-month low. Japan's Nikkei erased earlier losses to stand flat by late afternoon.
Mainland Chinese shares dropped, with CSI300 Index off 0.7 percent.
U.S. markets were closed on account of the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
In the currency market, the yuan bounced back from an 11-month low following moves by China's central bank on Tuesday to calm jittery financial markets.
The Chinese currency fetched 6.6315 per dollar in onshore trade, off Tuesday's low of 6.7204.
Major currencies were treading water as traders fretted about the fallout of the intensifying trade frictions between Washington and the rest of the world.
The euro was off by 0.2 percent at $1.16390 while the dollar was good for 110.51 yen, down 0.1 percent.

U.S. light crude futures traded down 0.4 percent at $73.86 per barrel, after rising above $75 for the first time in more than three years on Tuesday.

From junk bonds to emerging-market stocks, market turnover is through the roof, reaching multi-year highs. Within the S&P 500 Index, investors traded more than $2.9 trillion worth of shares in each of the past two quarters, a feat last achieved in early 2008.
Burgeoning uncertainty -- from monetary policy and protectionism, to cracks in the synchronized growth story -- has spurred elevated trading across assets.
“Market turnover tends to be high when uncertainty is high, as institutional investors tend to reshuffle their portfolios,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note last month. “Negative growth revisions coupled with political and policy risks including the Italian crisis and trade war risks are creating a lot more uncertainty this year relative to last year.”
It’s a similar story for developing-nation assets at the mercy of a strengthening U.S. dollar and trade tensions. Volume on the MSCI Emerging Market index reached $1.9 trillion in the three months through June, the most since 1998 when a wave of currency devaluations and defaults ripped through emerging economies from Thailand to Russia.
Churn on the most popular exchange-traded funds has similarly surged. ETF trading typically picks up during major macro events, as investors hedge and move positions with broad exposures. The iShares high yield credit ETF saw record quarterly turnover this year, while the largest stock ETFs had the most tumultuous first half in as much as a decade.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 07:12AM ET</span>",Samsung's second quarter profit may flag as smartphone innovation dries up,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) is expected to post its smallest profit growth in more than a year in the second quarter, as lackluster sales of its premium Galaxy smartphones overshadow its highly profitable chip business.
Analysts expect Samsung's smartphone sales to drop in the April-June quarter, following a more than 2 percent drop in the previous quarter as consumers flock to cheaper models from Chinese rivals such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810).
Samsung's lead over Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in the global smartphone market is under pressure after the U.S. firm's iPhone X exceeded market expectations while a lack of technological innovation dogs Samsung offerings.
""Functions (that) Samsung's mobile phones have are not attractive enough for customers to spend more money on,"" said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
Samsung's latest Galaxy S9 flagship phone, launched in mid-March, boasts lots of software but little in the way of technological wizardry. It is on track to sell less in its launch year than its predecessor Galaxy S8 series sold in 2017 after its debut, analysts said.
This is expected to drag on profit growth when the Korean conglomerate posts second-quarter earnings on Friday.
Analysts expect an operating profit of 14.9 trillion won ($13.3 billion) for the quarter, up 5.7 percent from a year earlier but less than the record 15.6 trillion won it posted in the March quarter, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.
Samsung, whose shares are down 9 percent so far this year, is also expected to issue guidance for the April-June quarter on Friday, giving estimates for revenue and operating profit. It will disclose detailed results in late July.
CHINESE CHALLENGERS
Samsung relies on traditional distribution to sell phones, whereas competitors have pulled ahead by leveraging online sales to provide high-end smartphones at competitive prices, Counterpoint analyst Shobhit Srivastava said.
Some investors are skeptical whether Samsung's upcoming line-up of foldable phones with sleek OLED screens will be innovative enough to gain traction with customers. The new Galaxy Note will debut on August 9 in New York.
""Samsung has to show something that will change the paradigm,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management that owns Samsung Electronics shares.
""Market watchers don't have high expectations for its smartphone business at the moment, when Chinese players have already caught up in technology and ideas.""
In China, the world's biggest smartphone market, Samsung's market share was just 1.3 percent in the first quarter, according to data from research firm Strategy Analytics, compared with Huawei's [HWT.UL], 22.5 percent.
Chinese smartphone makers - Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi - held the top spots in China, while Apple was the only foreign firm in the top five.
In India, Xiaomi displaced Samsung as market leader last year and continued to lead in the world's second-biggest smartphone market in the first quarter, according to a report from research firm Counterpoint.
To be sure, Samsung remains the world's largest smartphone maker, selling about 80 million gadgets a quarter and holding more than a fifth of the global market.
Its troubles in the mobile segment are overshadowing the success of its chips business, which generates about three quarters of Samsung's operating profit and about a third of its revenue. 
Operating profit in the chips business is expected to grow about 50 percent to a record 12.5 trillion won in the second quarter versus a year ago, according to analysts, as servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices demand more firepower to process streaming data.

Over a 10-year horizon, stocks have been almost 20 times as likely to deliver a positive return than a negative one, according to UBS. And two of the most-watched indexes prove the point: the S&P 500 Index is up 114 percent over the past decade and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index has risen 36 percent.
And as the economic cycle matures, most investors are unlikely to correctly time peaks and troughs, and end up losing profit compared with a buy-and-hold investor, UBS says. Despite the risks from elevated volatility, the wealth manager expects positive economic and earnings growth, which bodes well for equity markets.

The affected Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engines are used on ANA's  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner jets, the Japanese airline told reporters on Wednesday.
A compressor problem in the Trent 1000 package C engine has already led to planes being grounded by airlines such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL) and Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR). In June, Rolls Royce said it had found the same issue on a ""small number of high life Package B engines"".
ANA has been conducting inspections on Trent 1000 package C engines under instruction from Japan's transport ministry, with an expansion of inspections to include package B engines leading to the flight cancellations, the airline said.
In total 136 engines are affected, said ANA, the world's biggest 787 operator by fleet size.

Progress on a fix for the affected engines has been hampered by a global shortage of replacement parts, the airline said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Wednesday as worries over global trade persisted, with sentiment towards semiconductor stocks in particular souring after Micron Technology was banned from selling chips in China. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.2 percent by 0829 GMT (4.29 a.m. ET). Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.3 percent and the FTSE 100 (FTSE) 0.2 percent.
Trading has been choppy before a July 6 deadline when the United States is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from China. 
The tit-for-tat saga has hit market sentiment in recent weeks. News a Chinese court temporarily banned Micron Technology (O:MU) from selling chips in China, the world's biggest memory chip market, hitting shares in U.S. and Asian semiconductor stocks.
""The biggest risks to the technology sector are regulation and global semiconductor disruption from an escalating trade war,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said.
""At this point, the probabilities for both scenarios having major impacts on the technology sector in the short term are low,"" Garnry said.
Europe's tech sector (SX8P) fell 0.5 percent lower. Chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) was down 2.8 percent and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) .7 percent. Silicon wafer-maker Siltronic (DE:WAFGN) dropped 5.8 percent .
Recent guidance cuts from BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) and Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) have also weighed on sentiment around the sector, which has fallen more than 9 percent since June's 17-year high.
Smaller Swiss stock Comet (S:COTNE), whose business focuses on X-ray and radio frequency technology, issued a sales and profit warning for 2018 and saw its shares plunge nearly 18 percent.
Elsewhere, shares in  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) were among the biggest STOXX fallers, down 3 percent. A report citing fresh data in the bank's Estonian money-laundering case suggested its extent was greater than previously reported.

More broadly, gains across defensive sectors limited losses on the STOXX. Telecoms (SXKP) rose 1.2 percent and utilities (SX6P) and health care (SXDP) each gained around 0.2 percent.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",General Motors's China vehicle sales growth rate eases in second-quarter,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Wednesday its second-quarter sales in China increased 0.7 percent to 858,344 vehicles compared with the same period a year ago.
However, the second-quarter growth rate of vehicle sales in China eased compared with the January-March quarter, which saw an increase of 8 percent. The slowdown was mainly due to lean sales of Buick brand vehicles in the April-June period.
Buick sales dived 16 percent to 230,454 vehicles in the second quarter compared with a year-ago period. Sales of Cadillac, Chevrolet and other brands climbed in the second quarter from a year ago.
Buick sales declined due to a technology shift by the brand to offer a number of models with smaller-displacement, turbo-charged engines, said a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for General Motors. 
""Buick is leading the industry in the deployment of the cutting-edge small displacement engines, but it takes time for sales to pick up after technology changeovers,"" the spokeswoman said.
While the 1-litre and 1.3-litre turbo-charged engines match or exceed the performances of non-turbo 4-cylinder engines that were replaced, the new engines also offer greater fuel efficiencies. 
""We believe the adoption of these engines will be commonplace in China in the years ahead,"" she added.
In the first-half of 2018, GM and its local Chinese joint venture partners posted record sales, selling 1.84 million vehicles, up 4.4 percent from the first half a year ago. 
The previous first-half record was during the January-June period of 2016 when GM sold 1.81 million vehicles.

The Detroit automaker has stopped reporting monthly China vehicle sales, saying the monthly snapshot does not accurately reflect the market. The company now issues sales reports only on a quarterly basis.

731,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 09:50PM ET</span>",ZTE Loses Italy Deal Even as U.S. Restrictions Start to Ease,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is letting ZTE Corp (HK:0763). resume some business activities while the U.S. weighs an end to a seven-year ban on the Chinese telecommunications company.
The easing of restrictions didn’t come soon enough for ZTE’s bid to win a contract in Italy to supply wireless equipment to Wind Tre SpA. ZTE lost the deal because it’s barred from buying U.S. technology, and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB won the 600 million-euro ($700 million) contract instead, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because it hasn’t been announced. ZTE’s shares in Hong Kong rose about 2 percent.
The mixture of good and bad news is just the latest chapter in the saga of ZTE, which has seen its prospects and stock price rise and fall in the past few months over access to technology it needs to sell telecoms gear across the globe. The U.S. imposed the ban against the Chinese company earlier this year, saying that it failed to comply with punitive measures imposed after allegations of lying about equipment sold to Iran and North Korea.
Still, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to ease restrictions on ZTE, which has become a bargaining chip amid rising trade tensions with China. Last week, the Shenzhen-based company appointed a new chairman as part of its agreement to clean house and pay a record $1.4 billion fine to get back into business. The latest ZTE authorization by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security is valid from July 2 until Aug. 1.
ZTE is expected to be in compliance with U.S. demands by Aug. 1, a person familiar with the matter said.
Representatives for Ericsson and Wind Tre declined to comment on the Italy deal, which ZTE had originally won two years ago. Now, the Swedish telecommunications equipment maker has the multiyear accord to supply base stations for about 60 percent of Wind Tre’s Italian mobile networks.
The latest U.S. authorization permits China’s No. 2 maker of telecoms gear to support existing networks or equipment under contracts signed on or before April 15, when the U.S. blocked companies from selling components to ZTE on the sanctions violations. The ban had forced ZTE to announce it was halting major operations.
Trump reversed course in May, saying he was reconsidering penalties on ZTE as a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Later that month, the Trump administration announced it would allow the company to stay in business after paying the fine, changing its management and providing “high-level security guarantees.”
The about-face sparked concerns of ZTE being used as a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade negotiations to avert a tariffs dispute. Those talks have stalled and the U.S. is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods Friday, and another $16 billion may follow. China has said it will retaliate dollar-for-dollar on U.S. imports.
ZTE’s new management now faces the challenge of rebuilding trust with phone carriers and corporate customers. The company is said to be facing at least $3 billion in total losses from the months-long moratorium, which cut off the flow of chips and other components it needed to make its networking gear and smartphones.
In Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers remains concerned about ZTE’s threat to U.S. national security and is pushing for legislation aimed at restoring harsher penalties. Lawmakers are set to resume negotiations on legislation that will try to balance concerns that ZTE presents a security risk with efforts to get the company back into business.
This week’s authorization lets ZTE give support, including software updates, for ZTE phone models that were available to the public on or before April 15, and it allows parties to make and receive payments for permissible ZTE transactions. The order also authorizes “the disclosure to ZTE of information regarding security vulnerabilities in items owned, possessed or controlled by ZTE” to protect communication networks and equipment, it said.

Overnight, U.S. stocks reversed an early climb and ended lower. The S&P 500 stumbled after a Chinese court temporarily banned chip sales by Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). in the country. 
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 0.5% and 0.7% lower respectively by 9:45PM ET (01:45 GMT). The persistent weakness in the yuan remained in focus as the People’s Bank of China vowed to keep the currency stable and not to use it as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. 
Yi Gang, governor of the PBOC, said in a statement on Tuesday that the central bank would closely monitor fluctuation in the forex market and would take action to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level.
The news was cited as supporting the currency and helped it reversed some of its recent slump.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.8%. ZTE Corp received some focus as the company received a temporary reprieve from the U.S. Commerce Department that would allow it to conduct business needed to maintain existing network and equipment in the U.S. The China-based telecommunications equipment company was forced to cease most of its operations back in April after the U.S. imposed a supplier ban and accused the company of breaking an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Germany's Thyssenkrupp restructuring to continue after steel deal: CEO,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger said he would restructure the German industrial conglomerate further after signing a long-awaited deal to merge its steel assets with those of India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).
The steel merger, which will create Europe's second largest steel business with annual sales of 17 billion euros ($19.8 billion), was finally sealed last weekend after two years of at times difficult talks.
Seeking to manage expectations before a strategy presentation to the supervisory board next week, Hiesinger told a German newspaper that, although Thyssenkrupp had undergone far-reaching change, more was to come.
""Our work is never done. And our way is very clear,"" he told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview. ""Thyssenkrupp will become a strong industrial and services group.""
Hiesinger had faced pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott to get the steel deal done and devote his efforts to streamlining the group's unfashionable conglomerate structure.
Thyssenkrupp has reserved the sole right to decide whether and when to float the joint venture, called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, and would also collect 55 percent of the proceeds of a stock market listing.
Hiesinger parried questions on when that might happen, however, reminding his interviewer that the partners had agreed to keep a majority in the business for six years.
He also declined to give details of his forthcoming plans, saying only that he would present a ""sharper strategic picture"".
Thyssenkrupp, which makes everything from submarines to elevators, may put its Materials Services division - the group's biggest by sales - and parts of its shipbuilding business on the block.
A source has said that the supervisory board could decide on a divestment at its forthcoming meeting.
Hiesinger pushed back against investor criticism that he has been slow to overhaul the company, which employs 160,000 workers, since taking the helm in 2011.
""We have brought about a comprehensive change of culture,"" he said. ""We have substantially reduced the company's debts and significantly improved its earnings situation,"" he said.

744,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Allows ZTE to Resume Some Business Activity Temporarily,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is letting ZTE Corp (HK:0763). resume some business activities while the U.S. weighs ending a seven-year ban on the Chinese telecommunications company, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News.
The ZTE authorization by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security is valid from July 2 until Aug. 1. While it wasn’t immediately clear when a permanent order will follow, a person familiar with the matter said ZTE is expected to be in compliance with U.S. demands by Aug. 1.
ZTE’s stock surged its 10 percent daily limit in Shenzhen on Tuesday, the biggest jump in more than a year. Its shares in Hong Kong rose 7.6 percent.
The authorization permits China’s No. 2 maker of telecoms gear to support existing networks or equipment under contracts signed on or before April 15, when the U.S. blocked companies from selling components to ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The ban had forced ZTE to announce it was shutting down.
President Donald Trump reversed course in May, saying he was reconsidering penalties on ZTE as personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Later that month, the Trump administration announced it would allow the company to stay in business after paying a $1.3 billion fine, changing its management and providing “high-level security guarantees.”
The about-face sparked concerns of ZTE being used as a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade negotiations to avert a tariffs dispute. Those talks have stalled and the U.S. is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods Friday, and another $16 billion may follow. China has said it will retaliate dollar-for-dollar on U.S. imports.
ZTE took a major step forward in meeting the White House’s conditions by sacking its entire board and appointing a new chairman last week. A U.S. Commerce official said on June 22 that ZTE was close to clearing the final hurdle, by paying $400 million in escrow.
ZTE’s new management now faces the challenge of rebuilding trust with phone companies and corporate customers. The company is said to be facing at least $3 billion in total losses from the months-long moratorium, which cut off the flow of chips and other components it needed to make its networking gear and smartphones.
In Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers remains concerned about ZTE’s threat to U.S. national security and is pushing for legislation aimed at restoring harsher penalties. Lawmakers are set to resume negotiations on legislation that will try to balance concerns that ZTE presents a security risk with efforts to get the company back into business.
This week’s authorization lets ZTE give support, including software updates, for ZTE phone models that were available to the public on or before April 15, and it allows parties to make and receive payments for permissible ZTE transactions. The order also authorizes “the disclosure to ZTE of information regarding security vulnerabilities in items owned, possessed or controlled by ZTE” to protect communication networks and equipment, it said.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Dow Chemical settles SEC charges for failing to report ex-CEO's perks,"By Joshua Schneyer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A three-year U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation found that  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) failed to properly disclose around $3 million in perks for former Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, ranging from personal use of company aircraft to sporting events and dues Dow paid to a charity Liveris chaired. 
In a statement issued Monday, the SEC said it settled charges with Dow related to improper disclosure of the perks. The company agreed to pay $1.75 million and is required to hire a consultant to review its compliance with SEC disclosure rules related to executive perquisites for a one-year period. 
Dow neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings, according to the settlement.
Liveris, who led Dow for nearly 15 years, stepped down in April from the role of executive chairman at the newly combined chemicals giant DowDuPont Inc. He retired as chairman and CEO of Dow effective Saturday, when he also left DowDuPont’s board.
In its proxy statements, Midland, Michigan-based Dow understated by 59 percent perks its CEO received between 2011 and 2015, the SEC investigation found.  
Over that period, Liveris, one of the world’s best-known CEOs, earned around $20 million a year at the helm of Dow. However, the amount of additional, or “other compensation” Dow was required to disclose for Liveris – for perks he received – was “misstated in Dow’s 2013-2016 proxy statements,” the SEC found. 
The settlement comes after the SEC began investigating the matter in 2015, as Reuters first reported.
That year, Reuters published stories detailing how Dow internal investigators conducted a series of internal audits, from 2008 to 2013, into Dow spending involving Liveris and whether it had been properly disclosed to shareholders. 
Among the items they had flagged: Personal vacations Liveris took with family using Dow aircraft, parties Liveris threw at sporting events including the Super Bowl, allegedly with few Dow customers in attendance, and Dow’s financial support for the Hellenic Initiative, a Greek charity Liveris had co-founded. 
A former Dow fraud investigator, Kimberly Wood, filed a whistleblower lawsuit in 2014 alleging she was fired after questioning perks that Dow had provided to Liveris, and whether they were properly accounted for. Several other Dow officials, including former internal audit executive Douglas Anderson, had also raised questions about the CEO’s spending of Dow funds, Reuters found. 
It is not uncommon, and perfectly legal, for large U.S. companies like Dow to provide extraordinary perquisites – or company expenditures that personally benefit an executive, regardless of whether they also serve a business purpose – to top executives. However, SEC rules often require detailed annual disclosure of the perks an executive has received to the company’s shareholders.  These items can include personal travel for executives, friends and family in company aircraft, among other things. 
“The expenses at issue were legitimate business expenses authorized by Dow and within the scope of executive job duties,” said Dow spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley in an email to Reuters on Tuesday. Dow decided to settle the SEC case “to achieve finality and bring clarity to future disclosure decisions,” Bentley added. 
The company has begun implementing changes to improve its disclosure of executive perks, Bentley said. 

Liveris, an Australian national, retired from Dow after helping to shepherd through its mega-merger with former U.S. competitor DuPont (NYSE:DWDP). This week, ahead of the SEC’s announcement, Liveris, who could not immediately be reached for comment, was appointed to various corporate boards, including that of Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil giant Aramco.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Cuban flagship airline's woes deepen after crash,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta
HAVANA (Reuters) - In the busy summer travel period in Cuba, a long line of people wait for hours in the sweltering heat outside the Havana office of state-owned airline Cubana, many of them eager to visit families in the provinces.
But they are not waiting to book flights. Instead, they hope to get their money back on plane tickets or exchange them for bus tickets across the island.
Cubana, which has a virtual monopoly on domestic flights, has suspended nearly all of them due to a lack of working aircraft, plunging travel on the Caribbean's largest island into chaos and highlighting problems at what was once a vanguard of Latin American aviation.
The flight suspensions were made a month after a Cubana flight crashed after takeoff from Havana airport in May, killing 112 people. They come at a time when Communist-run Cuba is trying to stimulate tourism, one of the few bright spots in its economy, by promoting beach resorts and colonial towns hundreds of kilometers (miles) from the capital.
""Now I will have to take a 16-hour bus-ride to Guantanamo but what other options do I have?,"" said kindergarten teacher Marlene Mendoza, who was bathed in sweat and got a bus ticket to eastern Cuba after queuing for more than seven hours.
Analysts say Cubana's troubles stem largely from dual ills that afflict the whole state-run economy: the U.S. trade embargo and a problematic business model.
Cubana did not reply to requests for comment for this story.Founded in 1929 as one of Latin America's first airlines, Cubana was nationalized after Fidel Castro's leftist 1959 revolution. In its heyday, it flew Cuban troops to Africa and passengers to allied socialist countries around the globe. 
For decades it got around U.S. sanctions that restricted it from buying planes with a certain share of U.S. components - including European Airbus (PA:AIR) and Brazilian Embraers (SA:EMBR3) - by acquiring first Soviet and then Russian aircraft.
The carrier maintained a decent safety record but its reputation for mediocre service and delays prompted many foreign tourists to use mostly land transport. Then, over the past year, it started canceling more flights than usual, often putting passengers up in hotels for days, without commenting publicly on the disarray.After the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 crashed on May 18, Cubana said it had leased the plane from Mexican company Damojh due to a lack of its own aircraft. A second Damojh plane has been grounded pending a safety audit of its fleet by Mexican authorities, data from Flightradar24 shows, aggravating the shortage.
Cuban, Mexican and U.S. authorities are still investigating the crash and have not commented on possible causes. Damojh has said in a press release that is fully cooperating with those investigations into the ""lamentable accident.""
Just four of Cubana's own 16 planes are flying, according to a Reuters examination of data on Flightradar24 and Planespotters.net. 
NOT FLYING HIGH
Over the past month, the airline announced it was axing several routes mainly used by Cubans and reducing the frequency of flights to Santiago, Holguin and Baracoa, all popular tourist destinations. In a statement, it said it was working to resolve the situation and apologized for the disruption.
Cubana also suspended all international routes except to Buenos Aires and Madrid, several staff told Reuters. The company did not comment publicly, leaving would-be travelers sharing their confusion on online forums.
""It has lost a lot of prestige. It's already not the famous Cubana that used to fly to all parts of the world,"" said one former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, who retired 6-1/2 years ago after working for Cubana for 40 years.""Anywhere else in the world, a company like Cubana would have folded.""
Cubana said in mid-June it did not have enough aircraft largely because of maintenance issues and lack of parts, which aviation experts say can cost millions of dollars.
The airline sells tickets to Cuban citizens at heavily subsidized prices. Its budget is also stretched by ferrying official delegations around sometimes at a financial loss, a former Cuban diplomat familiar with Cubana operations said.
Cash-strapped Cuba points the finger at the 56-year-old U.S. trade embargo, saying it has cost its flagship carrier millions of dollars. 
The coup de grace was possibly the purchase of six An-158 regional jets from Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov since 2013.
Cubana has said those planes have had technical problems and getting parts for the joint Russian-Ukrainian project has proven difficult since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
An Antonov representative told Reuters Cubana had not been paying for the necessary work but it had signed a deal in April with the airline to cooperate ""to resume the use of AN-158 planes before the end of the current year.""Typically, airlines lease planes when theirs are undergoing maintenance or there is a spike in demand, but the U.S. embargo and financial constraints likely complicate this for Cuba, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of U.S. aviation consulting company the Teal Group.In May, Lithuanian lessor Avion Express and Italian lessor Blue Panorama both ended their contracts with Cubana, the companies told Reuters, without explaining why. Data from Flightradar24 shows they withdrew respectively four Airbus A320s and one Boeing 737. That is around the time when Cubana turned to the little-known Damojh, leasing the 39-year-old Boeing 737. 
Damojh has faced safety concerns in other countries in the region. Guyana's aviation authority told Reuters it had revoked Damojh's permit to fly there last year due to issues such as overloading planes. The airline declined to comment on the matter.

The crash in May has undermined trust in Cubana.""I like to travel by plane.It's faster and more comfortable,"" said Maylín López, 48, waiting at Havana's bus station for her 15-hour ride to eastern Cuba. ""But I can't even imagine doing that now.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's top food companies and farmers of crops such as beet sugar are pitted against each other as they lobby the U.S. government over plans to label genetically engineered ingredients.
At the heart of the issue is transparency over ingredients used in food. Packaged foods makers are facing flagging consumer trust and stagnating demand for some core products as consumers opt for foods with simpler ingredient lists. 
Many food companies want the government to require manufacturers to include on labels all ingredients that have been genetically modified, known as GMO. 
But farmers want the labels to exclude ingredients that have been so refined and processed that they no longer contain any trace of the transformed genes when they are used for food.
GMO crops have had their genes altered using biotechnology.
Nestle (S:NESN), the world's largest food maker, and rivals including  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) and  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) want the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include on the label ingredients from crops that were genetically modified such as canola and soybean oils and sugar from beets.
The USDA has asked for feedback on a proposal for required labeling of genetically engineered ingredients after a battle over the issue in states including Vermont sparked the U.S. Congress to pass legislation. The USDA has proposed a plan for applying the law. The deadline for public comment is July 3.
For farmers, facing a GMO backlash from consumers, the fact that the ingredients no longer contain transformed genes by the time they make their way into chocolates, pasta sauce and cereal should mean they are excluded from the labeling.
""The law has been very clear that the required disclosure is going to be for those crops or ingredients that contain the genetic material,"" said Luther Markwart, head of the American Sugar Beets Association in Washington. 
The entire U.S. sugar-beet crops is genetically engineered.
""For things like sugar and other refined products that don't contain the genetic material, the law does not apply to us,"" Markwart said.
But Nestle, which makes Stouffer's frozen prepared foods and Lean Cuisine frozen entrees, and Hershey, whose confections include Reese's Peanut Butter cups, disagree.
""Consumers want to know what is in their food and beverages and we believe that they deserve transparency. It's at the core of our business,"" Nestle spokeswoman Kate Shaw said in an emailed statement, noting the company believes those highly refined ingredients should fall under the requirements.
Hershey's global head of scientific and regulatory affairs, Martin Slayne, said labeling these ingredients is both important for consistency as well as for ""meeting consumer expectations on transparency.""
The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which helped lead many of the food company efforts to prevent state labeling initiatives, said in prepared comments on Tuesday that excluding refined ingredients would result in 78 percent fewer products being disclosed under the federal law.
About 90 percent of U.S. corn, soybean and beet sugar crops are bioengineered, the trade group noted. Unlike other regions, the United States has embraced the technology.
For farmers of sugar beet in states such as Michigan, North Dakota and Idaho, the herbicide-tolerant seeds have boosted yields and profits, and curbed some of the uncertainty of farming. 
But many Americans have said they want to know more about what is in their food, including whether bioengineered seeds have been used.
Should the USDA not require those ingredients be labeled as genetically engineered, the onus would be on food companies to decide how to label them. That could heighten tension between the companies and their ingredient suppliers.
How a food manufacturer chooses to label bioengineered ingredients that do not fall under the scope of the government requirements could be susceptible to challenge.
""We don't have any problem with transparency, but there’s been a lot of misinformation out there,"" Markwart said. ""The challenge is there's not a lot of space"" on a label.
GMO labeling has caused rifts between farmers and foodmakers in the past. 
In late 2016, a coalition of farmers criticized Dannon Co for marketing non-GMO products after the U.S. subsidiary of  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) made moves to overhaul its supply chain to reduce the use of the biotechnology in its yogurt products. The farmers said Dannon's advertising misled consumers.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, agrees with the farmers that their finished ingredients are no different scientifically from their non-GMO counterparts, but said the products should still require labeling.
""USDA should read the statute broadly and provide consumers with as much information as possible, but it should be scientifically accurate,"" said Gregory Jaffe, director of the center's Project on Biotechnology. ""They need a different disclosure for those highly refined ingredients.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>","After Harley spat, Trump says other motorcycle firms may come to U.S.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his administration is working to bring other motorcycle companies to the United States, following Harley-Davidson Inc's decision to shift some production for European customers overseas. 
Trump gave no details about what steps his administration is taking. Asked about the tweet, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had no comment.
""Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S,"" Trump said on Twitter, adding ""The U.S. is where the Action is!"" 
Harley-Davidson declined to comment on the tweet. 
Trump has threatened to impose higher taxes on the Milwaukee-based manufacturer in retaliation after it said on June 25 it was shifting some production for European-bound motorcycles from U.S. facilities to avoid tariffs being imposed by the European Union to counter U.S. duties imposed by Trump. 
Motorcycle companies based outside the United States include Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd and Yamaha Corp, Europe's BMW and Ducati as well as India's Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd, among others.
The company's announcement shook Trump's relationship with the iconic American brand. Executives had been feted at the White House during a visit with the president last year shortly after he took office.
In the face of waning U.S. demand for motorcycles, Harley has turned its focus on overseas sales, opening assembly plants in Thailand, India and Brazil. 
""Harley’s primary issue is U.S.-related due to shifts in demographics, which began well before any talks of tariffs and trade wars. Trump's reaction seems emotionally charged. Harley is simply playing the hand Trump dealt them,"" Bernstein analyst David Beckel said.
Shares of Harley were up 1.5 percent at $42.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Its shares took a hit after Trump tweeted that the company would be ""taxed like never before"" after its production announcement, although he gave no further information. 

Trump on Tuesday also appeared to incorrectly tie Harley's June announcement to its sales last year, saying Harley customers were unhappy with the move and that sales had fallen 7 percent in 2017.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>","Tesla shares skid further on concern over Model 3, report on brake test","(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares closed sharply lower on Tuesday amid analyst skepticism about its Model 3 cars and a news report that said the company had stopped running a brake test on its cars.
Tesla started the day in the red following Wall Street analyst reports pointing to lower-than-expected second-quarter deliveries, and uncertainty over the quality of Model 3 cars and its ability to meet weekly production targets profitably.
The share price tumbled further later in the session after Business Insider reported that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk ordered workers to stop putting Model 3 cars through a brake and roll test before leaving the factory. 
The test in question was stopped because it test drives every single Model 3 on its test track, which includes ""rigorous quality checks, including brake tests,"" the company said.
“To be extremely clear, we drive every Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle. There are no exceptions,” Tesla said.
Tesla closed down 7.2 percent at $310.86, and was on track for the stock's biggest one-day percentage decline since March 28. Trading volume was 1.3 times the 10-day moving average, during a session that ended three hours earlier than usual ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4. 
Shares had shed 2.3 percent on Monday after the company said it had met a long-elusive weekly production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars. It also reaffirmed its financial guidance and committed to boosting output to 6,000 cars per week by late August, but issued second-quarter vehicle deliveries that missed expectations.
Citing Tesla's lower than expected second-quarter delivery numbers and higher costs, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Ryan Brinkman said he now expects a second-quarter loss per share of $2.80, compared with his previous estimate for a $2.45 loss per share.
The achievement of the production milestone suggests ""higher costs, given the seemingly inefficient methods in which Tesla is reported to have achieved its production target"" including the construction of a temporary assembly line in a tent next to its main factory, Brinkman said.
Brinkman rates Tesla 'underweight' with a $180 price target.
Now that Tesla has met its weekly production milestone for the Model 3, the investor debate will shift to profitability, according to a research note from Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. 
He questioned ""whether Tesla can really evaluate customer satisfaction yet"" given that 11,166 of its Model 3 cars, likely including those manufactured in its tent, were still in transit. 
Sacconaghi has a market perform rating on the stock and a price target of $265.
Still, despite the risks, some investors sounded bullish. 
Joseph Fath, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price - the biggest investor in Tesla besides Musk, according to the latest public data - said Tesla was going through ""growing pains."" 
He described Tesla's announcement of 420,000 Model 3 reservations as an ""insane"" number that no other car maker can boast. 

""Are there risks? Absolutely. We factor those in when we size our position,"" Fath said.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Carrefour, Tesco deal to squeeze suppliers, big and small","By Dominique Vidalon and James Davey
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - A deal between  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) to team up on global purchasing will help them not only cut prices but also expand their own-label ranges, tightening a squeeze on major brand producers such as Nestle and Kraft Heinz.
The Carrefour-Tesco alliance will reset relationships with global suppliers like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), at a time when they are already battling sluggish demand and start-up rivals.
In a further blow to major consumer goods firms, the pair will also jointly source own-brand products, sales of which are growing rapidly in Europe due to the expansion of discounters like Aldi and Lidl which mostly stock private-label goods.
""Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain,"" said Mella Frewen, director general of FoodDrinkEurope, an industry lobby group.
However, the alliance could also allow smaller suppliers that only supply one of the retailers to double their business:
""They could be into a massive opportunity for which they might very well drop their prices and compete,"" said David Sables, CEO of Sentinel Management Consultants, which coaches suppliers on how to negotiate with big supermarket groups.
Sales growth at Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Unilever has been driven almost entirely by shifting more goods this year, rather than price rises given a tough retail environment.
In the latest salvo from an activist investor seeking to shake up the sector, Third Point on Sunday recommended a series of steps to boost earnings at Nestle, whose brands include KitKat chocolates and Thomy sauces.
Faced with consumers shifting towards healthier food and independent brands, manufacturers like Nestle are responding by trying to sell more premium, higher-priced items.
But retailers are reluctant to put up prices as they face their own battle with discount groups and online players like internet giant Amazon (O:AMZN). 
Top brands have long taken a hard line in negotiations with retailers, assuming that stores are loathe to remove consumers' favourite products from their shelves. 
That approach backfired for Nestle earlier this year when a buying group representing six European retailers flexed its muscles with the Swiss group, pulling some of its products for months during a pricing row that was only settled in May.
The Carrefour-Tesco alliance is just the latest purchasing agreement struck by major European retailers in recent years. German retailer Metro (DE:B4B) agreed a similar partnership with Auchan, Casino and Schiever of France last week.
The deals compound pressure on suppliers after Britain's second-ranked Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) agreed to buy Wal-Mart owned (N:WMT) Asda, the number three player.
PRIVATE-LABEL SALES RISING FAST
Tesco CEO Dave Lewis, a former Unilever executive, said branded giants were being outflanked by start-ups and retailers when it comes to developing new products.
""For a lot of branded manufacturers ... agility is not always there and so they are getting out innovated by a lot of small players,"" Lewis said last week.
While about half of Tesco's sales already comes from private label goods, which tend to be more profitable for retailers than branded ones, the figure is only about a quarter at Carrefour. The French firm aims to raise that to a third by 2022, while it is expected to cut the branded goods it offers by 20 percent.
Retailers creating their own products is seen as a major challenge by a quarter of top executives at consumer goods firms, according to a recent survey by consultants KPMG.
Private-label goods grew to account for more than 31 percent of sales in the European Union in 2016, and are set to keep growing, according to Nielsen, eroding demand for big brands.
As Lewis has sought to rebuild trust in the British retailer since an accounting scandal in 2014, Tesco has operated in a more collaborative way with suppliers, in contrast to a confrontational approach at Carrefour, Sables said.
""Suppliers to Carrefour might think if any of Tesco’s attitude in dealing with suppliers rubs off on Carrefour – that’s a positive thing,"" he said, adding Tesco could recommend its private-label suppliers to Carrefour and vice versa.
The alliance could impact companies like Biscuit International, a leading producer of own-label sweet biscuits owned by private equity firm Qualium Investissement, according to Yves Marin, an associate at Bartle Business Consulting.
The deal could take time to take effect as private-label contracts run for one to two years and suppliers will have to cross check prices of products sold by Tesco and Carrefour, Marin added.
POWER SHIFT 
In another sign of the shifting balance of power towards retailers, British supermarkets are taking longer to pay their suppliers, according to Duncan Swift, who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens.
""The swelling ‘piggy-bank’ of supplier monies held by supermarkets exacerbates the risk of them making unwarranted deductions which causes suppliers financial distress,"" he said.
Swift said retailers had to be careful about how they implement purchasing alliances so they do not ring alarm bells with competition authorities, adding they do this by not sharing too much information.
Ian Wright, chief executive of Britain's Food and Drink Federation, said the Tesco-Carrefour deal would increase concerns about buyer power stoked by the Sainsbury-Asda merger and the risks they impose on suppliers, mostly smaller firms.
""It is imperative that these important changes to retailer/supplier market dynamics are properly examined by the competition authorities – in the round,"" he said. 
Britain's Competition and Markets Authorities is already examining the merger of  Sainsbury  and Asda, which are expected to argue their deal is justified given the shake-up of the market due to the rise of the discounters and Amazon.
Discounters now account for 22 percent of sales of fast moving consumer goods in Europe, up from 17 percent a decade ago, according to data analytics firm Nielsen.
Analysts at Fitch Ratings do not expect the Tesco-Carrefour partnership to be subject to competition scrutiny as they have hardly any geographic overlap, although regulators could start paying more attention if more alliances emerge.
David McCarthy, HSBC head of consumer retail research, said buying alliances have not worked well in the past as retailers have failed to secure standardised prices. But he said Tesco and Carrefour now have a strong incentive to succeed.

""New ways of doing business are needed to deal with exogenous threats such as Amazon and discounter expansion,"" he said. ""What is different this time is both the desire and need for the deal to work.""

762,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>",U.S. drivers value fuel economy over brand as pump prices rise: poll,"By Joseph White and Chris Kahn
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. consumers put a high value on fuel economy when buying a new vehicle, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, as automakers lobby the administration of President Donald Trump for relief from mileage requirements enacted by his predecessor. 
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken May 31 to June 15, 41 percent of respondents said mileage was most important to them when buying a new vehicle, after cost and safety but before warranty, brand, design and high-tech features like navigation. 
This is roughly the same set of priorities that U.S. adults set in a similar poll taken in July 2017. 
Among respondents who identified as Trump voters, 34 percent said they wanted automakers to focus on improving fuel efficiency - a higher share than respondents who identified as Democrats or Hillary Clinton voters.
The Trump administration has signaled it could act soon to freeze emissions standards from 2020 through 2026. The state of California and other states have said they will fight such an action, leaving automakers to confront two separate emissions standards within the U.S. market.
Gasoline prices have risen about 30 percent since Trump took office, mainly due to a pact by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to curtail oil output to help reduce an oversupply of crude. They agreed last month to boost output.
But Trump, who has accused OPEC of manipulating oil prices, wants group leader Saudi Arabia to pump even more crude.
Gasoline prices, which could create a political headache for Trump ahead of November elections, are a visible cost of living indicator, especially during the summer vacation season. A record 47 million people in the U.S. are expected to travel more than 50 miles for the 4th of July holiday weekend. 
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.86 on July 3, the highest level for the July 4 period in four years, according to AAA, the motoring and travel group.
But fuel economy is a challenging issue for automakers. Trade groups representing major automakers competing in the United States have asked the Trump administration for more leeway to meet Obama administration vehicle fuel economy targets, arguing the rules are costly and not in sync with consumer demand. 
Those rules require automakers to slash the carbon emissions and roughly double the average fuel efficiency of their U.S. light vehicles by 2025 compared with 2011. 
Automakers are also worried that state mandates to sell more electric and hybrid vehicles will hurt profits, because those vehicles are money-losers in a U.S. market that is shifting toward sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks.
One reason is that 2018 sport utility vehicles on average are 24.7 percent more fuel efficient than SUVs of a decade ago, and are now close to the fuel economy levels of a 2008 sedan, according to an analysis by Cox Automotive, which tracks market data and purchase trends. A new 2018 SUV averages 23.7 miles per gallon. A new 2008 car averaged 24.8 miles per gallon.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",New U.S. Medicare cards prompt warnings about phone scams,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) 
Navigating Medicare can be complicated, but one big change recently introduced requires that you do absolutely nothing beyond opening an envelope. In fact, doing just about anything else could open the door to a damaging identity-fraud scam.
Medicare is mailing out new identification cards to 59 million Americans this year and in early 2019. The old Medicare cards use Social Security numbers as identifiers; the new cards use a unique, randomly assigned number. The changeover is part of a sweeping federal initiative to bolster defenses against fraud by reducing the widespread use of Social Security numbers as identifiers throughout the government.
Trouble is, phone scammers are taking the card replacement program as an opportunity to target seniors. The most common trick is to call Medicare enrollees and tell them they must pay for their new cards, then request their bank account information or Social Security numbers.
That opens the door to identity theft.
“We are hearing from people who have been told their Social Security payments will stop coming unless they give the caller their personal information, or that they can’t send the new Medicare card unless they get a payment,” said Amy Nofziger, a fraud expert with AARP.
In fact, the new card is free, and you do not need to do anything to get it. The new card does not change your Medicare coverage in any way. And Medicare will not be calling you about this. Just keep an eye out for an envelope containing the new card, and then give the new number to your healthcare providers. Then stash the card away for safekeeping, since carrying it around creates yet another theft risk. Finally, destroy the old card.
Simple, right?
Unfortunately, we've got a failure to communicate, to paraphrase the 1967 film classic “Cool Hand Luke.”
An AARP survey conducted in March found that 76 percent of adults aged 65 and older had not seen, read or heard ""much of anything at all"" about the new Medicare cards, or were not sure if they had. Three-quarters could not correctly identify the key change coming with the new Medicare identification numbers.
Nearly two-thirds were unsure or incorrect in thinking that Medicare would be charging beneficiaries a $25 processing fee for the new cards. And 56 percent were unsure or incorrect in thinking that Medicare would be calling to verify their Social Security number before they could receive their new card.
THE ROLLOUT SCHEDULE
Anyone signing up for Medicare now automatically receives the new card. Mailing of replacement cards already is complete in some eastern states (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia). The cards are in the mail now for most Midwestern states, plus California and Oregon. All new cards will be sent by next April. Details on the status of every state can be found on the Medicare website (https:// Most of the fraud schemes are being conducted by phone, Nofziger said. So understanding Medicare phone protocols is key. As a general matter, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) does not contact enrollees for Medicare numbers or other personal information, unless they have granted permission in advance. The only time you might receive a legitimate phone call from Medicare is if you have given CMS permission to call in advance; also, Medicare Advantage or prescription drug plans may call if you already are a member of that plan.  You also might get a call from Medicare if you have left a message requesting a call-back. More information on preventing Medicare fraud can be found at the CMS website: The Social Security Administration does sometimes call beneficiaries for customer service purposes, but representatives never ask for personal information. If you are not certain that a call from Medicare or Social Security is legitimate, hang up and call the agency back on the customer service lines: 1-800-633-4227 or 1-800-772-1213 for Social Security. If you have been victimized by a Medicare fraud scam, put a freeze or fraud alert on your credit with one of the three major credit reporting companies (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax (NYSE:EFX)). Nofziger notes you need call only one of these companies, which will in turn alert the others. Also notify your bank and credit card providers. AARP maintains a fraud hotline that can provide help: 1-877-908-3360.

(Reuters) - In a World Cup brimming with upsets,  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) looks on track to defeat soccer juggernaut and archrival Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn) in the closely watched jersey sponsorship battle.
The two brands both have three teams playing in their jerseys in the quarter-finals, with one game yet to be played to establish the final eight. But the Nike swoosh decorates the outfits of Brazil and France, the sides most favored by betting websites to win the World Cup, plus Croatia. 
Top German sports brand Adidas has Belgium, Russia and Sweden in the quarter-finals, and Tuesday's match between Adidas-sponsored Colombia and Nike-backed England will decide the final participant in the last eight. Puma SE (DE:PUMG) rounds out the group as the sponsor of the Uruguay team. 
""While Adidas dominates the European leagues and the U.S. professional league, certainly any market share that Nike can pick up in a non-traditional U.S. sport can only bode well for the stock price and brand,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Sports apparel makers typically sell the bulk of their fan merchandise ahead of the start of the World Cup, but a team's success on the field can generate extra demand for gear emblazoned with its emblems and colors.
U.S.-based Nike kitted out more teams than Adidas for the first time in Brazil in 2014. Adidas fought back this year sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams, including strong early contenders Germany and Spain, along with hosts Russia.
Nike supplied shirts for 10 countries this year.
(For a graphic on 'Jersey sponsors battle at World Cup' click https://reut.rs/2NkLUY5)
The tournament took a disastrous turn for Adidas last Wednesday, with 2014 champion Germany's unexpected elimination. Shares of Adidas, Germany's team sponsor, fell 2.7 percent in the following session.
In 2014, Germany accounted for a third of Adidas' roughly 9 million team jersey sales, Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia wrote in a recent client note, with an incremental 10 percent of those sales resulting from Germany's tournament victory. 
At the weekend, high-profile Adidas-sponsored teams Argentina and Spain were eliminated. Likewise, Mexico lost to Nike-sponsored Brazil on Monday.
Heading into this year's World Cup, Adidas downplayed its potential effect on sales, pointing to Russia's tepid economy.
But the World Cup remains a major marketing opportunity for Adidas, which is one of seven FIFA partners and the supplier of World Cup match ball since 1970. 
As well as team jerseys, sponsorship of top individual players is critical for the promotion of soccer shoes. Ahead of the World Cup, Nike expected 60 percent of players heading to Russia to use its footwear.

Since the start of the World Cup on June 14, Nike's stock is up over 3 percent, helped mostly by a strong quarterly report and sales outlook last Thursday. Adidas has lost about 5 percent.

767,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 01:11PM ET</span>",Hedge Fund Veteran Gives Up on Chinese Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- John Foo, who has managed long-only and hedge funds in Asia for 20 years, has sold out of Chinese stocks for the first time in his career as a money manager.
Foo’s Kingsmead Asset Management ended all bullish and bearish bets on China stocks about two months ago, as trade tensions and domestic credit tightening intensified, he said in an interview. Singapore-based Kingsmead manages about $60 million in an Asia-focused hedge fund and also oversees client money in separate accounts.
Foo’s decision to exit Chinese stocks has proven prescient as a $2 trillion rout deepened in the past week on concern a trade dispute with the U.S. will damage an economy already struggling with the effects of a deleveraging drive. China’s benchmark stock gauge on Tuesday approached levels last seen during a bout of panic selling in January 2016.
China stocks, mainly those listed in Hong Kong and the U.S., previously accounted for 40 percent of the fund’s net exposure, a gauge of risk measuring the difference between bullish and bearish bets.
It will take the yuan weakening beyond 7.5 to the dollar, “some meaningful deleveraging” and a 30 percent drop in valuations to entice him back, said Foo, who previously managed money at Frontpoint Partners. The yuan touched an 11-month low Tuesday after suffering its biggest decline in 14 years last quarter, and the Shanghai Composite Index closed little changed after falling as much as 1.9 percent.
Kingsmead joins firms such as FengHe Fund Management and Pinpoint Asset Management in cutting allocations to China stocks.
Kingsmead’s hedge fund has fallen 7 percent this year because it doesn’t hedge currency risks, Foo said, and most Asian currencies have weakened against the dollar. The Asia fund gained 22 percent last year, compared with a 20 percent return for similar strategies tracked by Eurekahedge Pte.
Among the stocks Foo sold were auto-dealers, which are likely to suffer when China slaps a retaliatory 25 percent on U.S.-made vehicles. Tighter credit in China as the government tackles ballooning household debt could also erode auto-dealers earnings growth, he said.
He has also sold Chinese financial stocks and export-related companies, he said, declining to name them.
With China out of favor, Kingsmead is increasing investments in Vietnam, such as Dat Xanh Group, the country’s largest real-estate broker, and Hoa Phat Group, the nation’s biggest listed steel maker, which are benefiting from rising property and infrastructure demand.
Foo says a prolonged trade war will give companies more incentive to move factories to Southeast Asia.
“The beauty of these stocks is they all have single-digit price-earnings with over 20 percent growth in the next two years or more,” he said.
Kingsmead also likes Thai companies investing in the growing Mekong River region spanning Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, which is less vulnerable to the trade spat, Foo said."
768,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",China Turmoil Leaves Hong Kong Equity Bulls With Taste of Regret,"(Bloomberg) -- Valuations have cratered, earnings estimates are down and forecasters are slashing their targets on Hong Kong’s stock market, which has gone from darling to pariah in under half a year.
While investors the world over worry about a tumbling yuan and the Federal Reserve’s plans to lift borrowing costs, the brunt of the impact is increasingly felt in a city that is entwined with both. The Hang Seng Index lost 1.4 percent when markets reopened Tuesday following a long weekend, as another sign that China’s economy may be slowing faster than expected added fuel to the selloff and took multiples back to two-year lows.
The Hang Seng Index’s best quarterly winning streak since 1996 has ground to a painful halt, punished by companies’ reliance on China for profits, Hong Kong’s ties to U.S. monetary policy and a loss of love for favorites like Tencent Holdings Ltd. After five quarters of gains and hitting a record high in January, the benchmark posted a loss in the three months through June.
“It’s getting ugly,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. in Singapore, who was bullish on Hong Kong stocks until March. “China data just continues to sour and the yuan is bringing up memories of 2015. Whether we could see capital outflows is a question nobody thought they’d be asking. Hiding in cash is the only way to go now.”
Bulls are losing faith in a market that treated them with some of the world’s best returns in January, when even the pessimists were calling for only a temporary pullback. International investors, who piled into funds tracking Hong Kong and offshore-listed China stocks for 17 straight weeks, have withdrawn almost $4 billion since early June, according to China International Corp.’s Hanfeng Wang and Yingqi Lin.
A glut of large initial public offerings is also threatening to undermine existing shares, as billions of dollars in new stocks may draw more liquidity from the market. Xiaomi Corp., which raised $4.7 billion after pricing its initial public offering at the low end, expects to begin trading on July 9. Meituan Dianping is targeting an IPO in Hong Kong that may raise as much as $6 billion, while China Tower Corp.’s listing could match the city’s biggest since 2010.
Stocks in Hong Kong have still held up far better than those on the mainland, remaining in the green throughout most of 2018 until the yuan’s descent accelerated in mid June. Strategists still see a rebound in the second half, though many have tempered their projections for the city’s benchmarks, including Nomura Holdings Inc. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“I wish I had been more negative in January, when it was clear that Hong Kong markets were getting frothy,” said Wendy Liu, head of China equity research at Nomura. “The question we’re getting is whether China economy is about to collapse or not -- we need more data to gauge that.”
Investors are paying less than 11 times projected earnings for the Hang Seng Index -- a multiple that’s about 5 percent lower than its 10-year average. Earnings expectations have started to falter, after their resilience in February acted as a support against further losses in a global selloff. Morgan Stanley says members of the index generate an average 60 percent of their earnings in yuan, which is one of the world’s worst performing currencies over the past month.
Adding to the pressure is a buyer’s strike from Shanghai, where investors have been net sellers of Hong Kong stocks for three consecutive months through exchange links with the city. Also, a currency peg with the U.S. is driving up the cost of borrowing: Hong Kong’s one-month interbank rate is topping 2 percent for the first time since 2008.
With a June 2019 target of 27,200 points for the Hang Seng Index, or 4.7 percent below Tuesday’s close, Morgan Stanley believes the selloff in Hong Kong has room to run.
“It’s a combination of multiple factors: yuan weakness, trade uncertainty, expectations for four Fed rate hikes and the tightening liquidity situation in China,” Morgan Stanley equity strategist Laura Wang said by phone from Hong Kong. “We’re not expecting any immediate change to any of those. Even southbound flows have turned.”"

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Ex-Intel executive departs Google as chipmaker searches for CEO,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Diane Bryant, a former  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) executive who headed the chipmaker's data center unit, is leaving Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) cloud computing unit less than a year after joining and just as her old employer searches for a new chief executive.
Google Cloud, the unit of Alphabet that competes against Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) to sell computing services to businesses, confirmed on Tuesday that Bryant had departed. Bryant left Intel in 2017 and joined Google's cloud unit as chief operating officer later that year.
In a statement, Google said of Bryant that it was ""grateful for the contributions she made while at Google and we wish her the best in her next pursuit."" Business Insider earlier reported the news of Bryant's departure.
Intel has launched a search involving both internal and external candidates for a new CEO. Former Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich resigned last month after a probe of a relationship he had with another Intel employee that violated a company anti-fraternization policy.
Analysts widely expect that Intel's interim CEO, finance chief Bob Swan, will not seek to fill the top job permanently. Intel, which was founded 50 years ago this month, has never appointed an outsider as CEO, instead drawing on longtime top executives.
An Intel spokesman declined to comment on the company's CEO search or whether Bryant was under consideration for the job.

Before she departed Intel, Bryant oversaw the company's data center group, selling chips to large customers like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google and Microsoft. Such ""data centric"" chip sales have grown to account for half of Intel's revenue.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 12:07PM ET</span>","Firing fake pineapples, Pernod uses 'influencers' to drive sales","By Martinne Geller and Kate Holton
LONDON/CANNES, France (Reuters) - This spring, Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Malibu Rum paid American singer Nick Jonas to host a competition in Vietnam that began with 33 Instagram stars battling to catch fake pineapples while flying off a giant waterslide into the sea. 
In one month alone, videos and pictures from the ""Malibu Games"" were viewed 2.4 billion times online, showing the potential for so-called ""influencer marketing"" to reach social media-mad consumers that may overlook older, traditional brands.
This kind of advertising, where celebrities and popular bloggers earn money by posting about products, has developed over the past five years on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter (N:TWTR), Facebook (O:FB) and YouTube.
Influencer marketing found early popularity with beauty, fast fashion and fitness brands but has now spread across the spectrum, even though some analysts question whether it actually works. 
It accounted for about $1 billion a year of advertising spend on Instagram alone last year, according to influencer marketing agency Mediakix, which predicts the entire market could reach $10 billion by 2020; still tiny in the near $600 billion ad realm, but growing fast. 
Thibaut Portal, leader of Pernod's global media hub, said influencer marketing was playing a ""growing and key role"" in the French spirit maker's campaigns and was in use on all its major brands.
Influencers give Pernod more options for spending marketing dollars online, an important destination for liquor companies which have restrictions on television advertising in some places, such as France.
Sometimes brands use social media stars with millions of followers to drive awareness of a brand, but other times pick ""micro-influencers"" with thousands of followers who, as experts in their industry, can impact choices. 
""We are not interested in working with big, massive influencers with four or five million followers (when) the week after, the same influencer is going to post a picture of a washing machine,"" Portal said.
The rapid growth of influencer marketing shows how the broader ad industry is changing, as brands struggle to reach consumers in a world of fragmented content on the internet, now the biggest platform ahead of TV. 
Brands will pay anywhere from $10,000 to more than $100,000 for a single social media post, experts say, depending on the size, engagement and loyalty of the person's followers. This can buy online content more cheaply than traditional advertising. 
Pernod is far from alone in using the technique, with fellow consumer giants like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mars all testing the waters. Pernod declined to say how much of its 1.7 billion euro marketing budget it spent on influencers, but Unilever said it accounted for ""tens of millions"" of its 7.7 billion euro marketing last year. 
However some analysts question whether a viral video clip seen millions of times actually lifts sales. 
Influencers can also artificially enhance their audience numbers - which often dictate their fees - by purchasing fake followers, machine-generated profiles fueled by ""bots"". This was highlighted last month when Unilever said it would cut ties with influencers that buy followers.
""If it was a child before, it's a teenager now, and it's got to grow up quickly,"" Neil Waller, co-founder of influencer marketing platform Whalar, said about the fledgling advertising area. 
CUT OUT MIDDLEMAN
Pernod credits Malibu's social media presence for helping to invigorate the brand, whose sales volume grew in each of the past three years, according to researchers IWSR, after falling the previous two.
The Malibu Games mostly featured people whose notoriety centers on social media. Besides singer Jonas (15.4 million followers on Instagram), participants included Sierra Dallas (1.2 million), Alba Paul Ferrer (878,000) and Rory Kramer (483,000). 
The influencers posted about their experiences of the three-day event, including enough short video clips to make up over four hours of footage. A teaser video was watched 10 million times, the company said.
Getting creative content directly from influencers also allows brands to skirt the middleman, traditional ad agencies owned by the likes of WPP (L:WPP), Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG). 
Nonetheless, agencies are using the tactic too. 
""We're deeply involved in it, when creative agencies launch campaigns there will be an influencer element in it,"" Jonathan Nelson, digital boss of the world's second largest ad company Omnicom said. ""These are tailored experiences for you.""
Research by Accenture found that 53 percent of consumers aged 18 to 34 were loyal to brands that partnered with social influencers, compared with just 8 percent for those over 55. 
According to e-commerce analytics firm L2, 72 percent of Instagram users report making purchase decisions based on something that they saw on the site.   
Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed said he expected influencers to take a growing part of his budget. 
""We see it as a very powerful vehicle ... creating very authentic real-time content at a much lower price,"" Weed told Reuters. ""The way it penetrates the culture, I really do think it's going to be a big and vibrant market."" 
Mars, another major advertiser, is also a fan. It divides its ad budget, with 80 percent going on proven campaigns and media, 15 percent in areas that are unproven but where there is a method of measurement, and 5 percent on total experimentation. 
Influencer marketing falls into both the biggest and the second-biggest categories depending on the type of campaign. 
Goat, a nearly three-year old agency that works with around 40,000 influencers, helped recruit members for the Malibu Games, opting for stars with a broad, young appeal. 
""The key is can they influence their audience,"" co-founder Arron Shepherd said. ""With Malibu we're looking to make it the number one drink that people think of in the summer.""

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",New 3M CEO seeks to develop or buy way to higher growth,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The new chief executive of 3M Co (N:MMM) is looking at both buying companies and selling underperforming units while investing in developing the next blockbuster product in a bid to drive faster growth at the industrials group that makes products ranging from adhesive tape to air filters.
""We're looking at acquisitions in attractive parts of our portfolio… and how they can leverage our fundamental strengths,"" Mike Roman told Reuters just before taking up his role on July 1. ""In some cases that might also lead to divestitures.""
3M's sales were $31.7 billion in 2017, and business is growing during an economic upturn. But investors are not satisfied with the rate of growth, and the company's shares fell 7 percent in April after 3M cut its organic sales growth forecast for 2018 to a range of 3 percent to 4 percent from a range of 4 percent to 5 percent.
Shares were up 1.5 percent on Tuesday morning at $198.34, still well below the year high of $259.77.
""The knock against 3M is that they are so big it's hard for them to maintain a higher growth rate,"" said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar. 3M needs a significant new product it can sell across different groups in its portfolio, he said. 
One promising 3M product is Novec, a non-flammable, non-conductive liquid fluorochemical that could be used to cool servers at data centers and which 3M also is testing for use in electric vehicles. 
3M CEO Roman highlighted that the conglomerate has increased research and development spending to 6 percent of revenue from 5.5 percent.
3M has also beefed up its safety business - which sells products such as masks, protective clothing and harnesses - with the acquisition of Capital Safety for $2.5 billion in 2015 and Scott Safety for $2 billion last October. 
The company has already shed underperforming businesses. Most recently, 3M said in December it would sell most of its telecoms business to  Corning Inc  (N:GLW) for $900 million. 
William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said growth through acquisition makes sense for 3M, but cautioned valuations have risen a lot in the last couple of years, making it more difficult for newly purchased businesses to drive quick gains in profit.
Steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have not hurt 3M directly, Roman said. But higher raw materials costs could cause 3M customers to move their factories.

""We haven't seen our customers shifting production yet,"" he said. ""But depending on where trade negotiations go, they could shift production. But we would follow them.""

788,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Top U.S. automakers report higher vehicle sales in June,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Top U.S. automakers reported stronger June sales, as consumers continued to snap up sport utility vehicles and trucks in larger numbers, parking for now worries about rising fuel prices, higher interest rates and trade tensions. 
Investors have sold off shares in Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM) ,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) during the past month. Rising tensions between the United States and its trade partners and threats of tit-for-tat auto tariffs have rattled the auto sector, adding to worries that the U.S. auto industry's nine-year recovery from the 2008 financial crisis must soon end.
Still, June was a solid month for vehicle demand in the United States, and especially for the SUVs and large pickups that generate the bulk of global profits for the Detroit Three.
A poll of economists by Reuters showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.0 million vehicles for the U.S. auto industry in June. U.S. vehicle demand hit a record 17.5 million vehicles in 2016. 
No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors (N:GM), which stopped reporting monthly numbers beginning April, said its sales rose 4.6 percent to 758,376 for the quarter ended June 30, helped by strong truck sales and a wave of all-new crossovers.
""Customers are buying with confidence because the economy is strong and they expect it to remain strong,"" said Kurt McNeil, GM U.S. vice president, sales operations. 
Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said it sold 230,635 vehicles in June, compared with 227,979, a year earlier. Sales of Ford-brand SUVs grew 8.1 percent to 77,453 vehicles, and were a record for the month, the company said.
Ford said its F-series large pickup trucks, the best-selling model line in the U.S. market, were on track to top the previous annual record of 939,511 vehicles sold set in 2004. 
Fiat Chrysler said June U.S. sales rose about 8 percent to 202,264 vehicles, led by the Jeep brand, which notched its best June ever with a 19 percent increase.
A positive sign for automakers is that U.S. jobless rates are at the lowest levels since 2000, and average incomes are starting to grow more robustly. Still many analysts are forecasting weaker sales for the second half of 2018 and further declines in U.S. vehicle demand next year.
Rising interest rates are increasing monthly payments for cars and home mortgages, and bankers are tightening terms for vehicle loans, Cox Automotive economist Charlie Chesbrough said during a recent briefing on the industry outlook. ""Affordability is getting tighter,"" he said.
Cox forecasts U.S. car and light truck sales will decline to 16.8 million vehicles this year, and slide to 16.5 million vehicles in 2020. 

General Motors and other automakers have warned sales could drop dramatically if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes steep tariffs on foreign vehicles and imported auto parts, raising prices to consumers and costs to manufacturers.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Ryanair Irish pilots vote to strike for the first time,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) pilots who are members of its Irish trade union will go on strike for the first time on July 12 after the union said on Tuesday the airline had failed to meet demands over new working practices.
Europe's biggest budget carrier averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by deciding to recognize trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries.
Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, has so far signed agreements with pilots in Italy and Britain, two of its largest markets, but also experienced minor disruption in Germany and Portugal.
Ryanair pilots eligible to vote in a ballot called by the Forsa/IALPA trade union, which does not include contractors, backed the call to engage in industrial action and will strike for 24 hours next week.
The union, which said 94 of the 95 ballots returned were in favor of industrial action, has advised Ryanair that it will notify it of additional strike days in due course but also remains available and willing to engage on the issues.
A spokesman for Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.
While Ryanair has also had success in Britain and Italy signing recognition agreements with cabin crew, some of its crew will gather in Dublin on Wednesday to demand better conditions in their first pan-European summit.

Facebook shares were down 2 percent at $193.36 in early trading on the Nasdaq, erasing nearly $12 billion from the company's market valuation.
The stock lost about 18 percent of its value in the seven trading days after the data scandal broke, but has since gained about 27 percent to date.
Facebook has faced intense scrutiny around the Cambridge scandal, which saw millions of users' data improperly accessed by the political consultancy. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have joined the Department of Justice in its inquiries about the two companies and the sharing of personal information of 71 million Americans, the Washington Post reported citing five people. 
A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters late on Monday that it is cooperating with officials in the U.S., UK and beyond.
""We've provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues,"" the spokesperson said. The questioning from federal investigators centers on what Facebook knew three years ago and why the company did not reveal it at the time to its users or investors, the Washington Post said.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>",AirAsia heaps pressure on Airbus over A330neo order,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - AirAsia X Bhd (KL:AIRA) needs to ensure the price, performance, engines and payment terms for the Airbus (PA:AIR) A330neo are right before it will ""finally confirm"" its order for 66 of the jets, its co-group chief executive said on Tuesday.
AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA), is the largest customer for the A330neo, which is struggling for sales relative to the rival Boeing 787 (N:BA).
AirAsia X has a firm order for the fuel-efficient A330neo widebody jets to replace its older first-generation A330s but it has been pushing back the delivery dates.
It has been talking to Boeing about buying the 787-10 jet as an alternative and is likely to make a decision later this year, a person familiar with the discussions previously told Reuters.
The airline's co-group CEO, Tony Fernandes, said on Twitter on Tuesday that he was visiting Airbus at its Toulouse headquarters to discuss the A330neo and the smaller A321neo.
""We have ordered the 330 but to finally confirm it we must make sure price is right. Performance is right. Engine is right. PDP (pre-delivery payments) is right."" he said. ""And performance of the 330 251-tonne is right. If right, (it is) the plane we dreamt of and fought for and then we can order more. Or else.""
Pre-delivery payments are made to manufacturers in the run-up to production and are sometimes financed using loans. It remains unclear to what extent AirAsia has yet paid advances.
The remark is the latest in a series of teasing comments from Fernandes apparently designed to heighten competition between Boeing and Airbus and to take advantage of AirAsia's position as an anchor customer for the A330neo.
After a series of losses to Boeing's 787, several analysts have said the future of the A330neo will be under mounting scrutiny if AirAsia abandons its order. 
However, with this month's Farnborough Airshow approaching, Airbus is expected to do its utmost to try to bag at least one alternative order to restore some momentum to the program.
With only 214 A330neos on order - including 66 for AirAsia X and another 28 for IranAir that are unlikely to be delivered due to U.S. sanctions - the program is in need of a fresh boost to mop up more than 15 unsold production slots next year.
The 251-tonne version, which could fly non-stop from Kuala Lumpur to London, is designed to provide more range by improving fuel capacity but will not be available for delivery until 2020.

Fernandes also said on Tuesday he believed the A321neo, a large narrowbody jet, was a ""great plane"" and raised the prospect of ordering more. He is also the CEO of AirAsia, which has 100 A321neos on order.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) (PNB) is closing nearly all its operations in a Mumbai branch that was at the heart of a $2 billion fraud, according to four sources with knowledge of the decision.
The move to downsize the Brady House branch, which has come to symbolize the biggest banking scandal in the country's history, comes as India's second-largest state lender seeks to tighten controls and restore its reputation.
The 123-year-old bank has lost more than half its market value since the fraud came to light in late January.
PNB will move all big client accounts out of the branch in downtown Mumbai that according to an internal investigation saw ""exceptional growth"" in the past few years largely because of its controversial dealings with firms owned by two related jewelers.
PNB has alleged that a handful of staff at the branch issued fake bank guarantees between 2011 and 2017 to help the firms of Indian diamond magnate Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi raise billions of dollars in foreign credit. The duo have denied wrongdoing and are currently abroad.
Fronted by an imposing colonial facade, the branch has a foreign exchange department and handles mainly mid-sized corporate accounts. It also has a small retail operation, which will stay open after the restructuring, said the sources who declined to be named as the discussions were not public.
One of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that PNB was transferring some employees and big accounts - each involving annual transactions of more than 500 million rupees ($7.28 million) - to large corporate branches for ""better monitoring"".
""The bank has already started moving accounts to neighboring branches,"" said one of the sources. ""Only a small retail banking operation will remain at the branch for the time being.""
The bank will consider similar steps for some other branches too so that risks are minimized, said one of the sources.
The transfer of accounts was part of a regular restructuring, a PNB spokesman told Reuters.
""Reallocation of some of the accounts is part of the regular restructuring process at PNB to strengthen internal systems and processes and centralize certain critical functions,"" the spokesman said in a statement.
""Retail operations for PNB customers continue to operate from the branch.""
Three of the sources said that more than two-dozen employees were informed this week about the decision to cut back the Brady House operations. The sources said the branch could eventually be shut down.
However, the spokesman said PNB had no plans to close operations there.
Business at the branch's foreign exchange operations has come down ""substantially"" since the fraud came to light, said one of the sources.
PNB has mainly blamed a couple of Brady House employees for executing the fraud, but Reuters reported last month that a 162-page investigation report by the bank has found widespread risk control and monitoring lapses by 54 staff, many outside the branch.
On Friday, Chief Executive Sunil Mehta said PNB was on track to ""bounce back within six months"".

LONDON (Reuters) - The tiny but ultra-rich Gulf state of Qatar has agreed to buy one of New York's most iconic buildings, the Plaza Hotel, for around $600 million, adding a development that was once owned by U.S. President Donald Trump to its luxury property portfolio.
Qatar's state-owned Katara Holding is buying full ownership of the hotel, including a 75 percent stake from Indian business group Sahara India Pariwar, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. 
Katara and Sahara were not immediately available to comment. 
The source declined to be identified because the deal was not public.
Qatar has been buying top hotels and luxury properties in the West over the past decade as part of a drive by its $300 billion-plus sovereign wealth fund to diversify the wealth it accumulates from gas and oil exports.
Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, already owns landmark hotels such as The Savoy and The Connaught in London. 
Its wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has also invested in large Western companies such as carmarker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and mining giant  Glencore  (L:GLEN).
The pace of Qatar's overseas investment had been expected to slow down amid a crisis in the Gulf after its neighbors - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain - imposed economic sanctions on Doha for allegedly supporting terrorism.
Qatar denies the allegations and says the economic boycott is an attempt to undermine its sovereignty.
Qatar has had to inject dozens of billions of dollars into its economy, but in recent months has said the impact of the boycott has been mitigated, allowing it to resume large scale investments abroad, including buying a stake in Russian oil major Rosneft.
The Plaza Hotel deal is the largest investment in the Western property market by Qatar since the start of the blockade in June last year.
Trump bought the Plaza in 1988, but had to sell it to a group of investors including Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal more than two decades ago as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.
Prince Alwaleed had remained a minority shareholder in the hotel prior to the Qatari transaction. Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sahara has been trying to sell its stake for several years amid financial difficulties for its chairman, Subrata Roy.
The Plaza has hosted guests including the Beatles and Marlene Dietrich, who performed there. It was also the site of Trump's marriage to Marla Maples in 1993.

The hotel has featured in movies including the 1959 American thriller by Alfred Hitchcock, ""North by Northwest""; the 1991 drama ""Scent of a Woman"" starring Al Pacino; and the 1990 gangster drama ""The King of New York"" with Christopher Walken.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>","Shouting CEO, changing rules: inside Tesla's Model 3-building sprint","By Alexandria Sage and Salvador Rodriguez
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A tense and short-tempered Chief Executive Elon Musk barked at engineers on the Fremont, California assembly line. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc pulled workers from other departments to keep pumping out the Model 3 electric sedans, disrupting production of the Model S and X lines. And weekend shifts were mandatory.
Tesla pulled out all the stops in the final week of June to meet its goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to employees who spoke to Reuters. 
Whether Tesla can do it week in and week out - and without relying on overtime and extra hands - is another question, and one that weighed on investors Monday, as shares slumped 2.3 percent. 
Leading up to Sunday morning's production milestone, Musk paced the Model 3 line, snapping at his engineers when the around-the-clock production slowed or stopped due to problems with robots, one worker said. Tesla built a new line in just two weeks in a huge tent outside the main factory, an unprecedented move in an industry that takes years to plan out its assembly lines, and said the tented production area accounted for 20 percent of the Model 3s produced last week.
""They were borrowing people from our line all day to cover their (Model 3) breaks so the line would continue to move,"" said a Model S worker on Sunday. 
Because of the focus on the Model 3, the S line is about 800 cars behind, the worker said.
""They've been throwing Model 3s ahead of the S to get painted to try to assure that they make their goal of 5,000,"" the worker said. ""The paint department can't handle the volume.""
Disruption of the Model S and X lines could threaten Tesla's target of building 100,000 of those vehicles in 2018. Tesla built 49,489 of those cars in the first half of this year.
Asked about the potential S and X impact, Tesla said it also produced 1,913 of those vehicles during the last week of the quarter along with its Model 3s.
Tesla said it built a total of 28,578 Model 3s in the second quarter, and 40,989 since production began last July. 
Last week's big push also brought a rewrite of the employee attendance policy. After mandatory weekend shifts were assigned, two workers said, Tesla rescinded a policy promising workers at least one week's notice before weekend work. 
""The manager and supervisor are verbally going around and saying: 'If you don't come in, you'll be written up',"" one of the workers told Reuters last week.
Some employees are worried the frenetic pace plus long hours could burn out workers. One employee said they were told to keep working until they met their daily production mark, not when their shifts ended. 
“They said starting tomorrow be prepared to work up to 12 hours,"" said the Model S employee on Monday. ""It's gonna be basically 12 hours from now on and I’ve got a feeling it’s gonna be six days a week.”
To make its number, Tesla was willing to ""spend any kind of money,"" a Gigafactory worker said, pointing to the new battery assembly-line flown in from Europe via cargo planes to the Gigafactory in May. 
In the morning of Sunday, July 1, about five hours after the self-imposed second-quarter deadline had passed, the number 5,000 flashed on a countdown screen viewed by Tesla's Model 3 assembly-line workers. The Model 3 itself bore a ""5,000"" sign in its front window. 
Tesla said on Monday that some of its Model 3 production would be on break as part of the July 4 holiday, with production to resume on Thursday. Tesla plans to build 6,000 Model 3s per week by August.
But the worker told to expect longer shifts warned that pushing assembly-line workers too hard could backfire.
""He (Musk) is gonna go through an awful lot of people because people are gonna start getting hurt left and right,"" by the fast-moving assembly line, the worker said. 
""There's only so fast a person can move.""

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 06:37AM ET</span>",Trump moves to block China Mobile's U.S. entry on security concerns,"By Brenda Goh and Sijia Jiang
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. government has moved to block China Mobile (HK:0941) from offering services to the country's telecommunications market, recommending its application be rejected because the firm posed national security risks.
The move by President Donald Trump's administration comes amid growing trade frictions between Washington and Beijing. The United States is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from China on July 6, which Beijing is expected to respond to with tariffs of its own.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should deny the state-owned Chinese firm's 2011 application to offer telecommunication services between the United States and other countries, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) said in a statement posted on its website. 
""After significant engagement with China Mobile, concerns about increased risks to U.S. law enforcement and national security interests were unable to be resolved,"" said the statement, quoting David Redl, assistant secretary for communications and information at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which NTIA is part of. 
China Mobile, the world's largest telecom carrier with 899 million subscribers, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on Tuesday.
However, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, in response to a question about China Mobile at a daily briefing, said: ""We urge the relevant side in the United States to abandon Cold War thinking and zero sum games."" 
China always encourages its companies to operate in accordance with market rules and to respect the laws of the countries it operates in, he said, adding the United States should stop putting ""unreasonable pressure"" on Chinese firms.
Another Chinese firm that has been caught in the crosshairs of the trade spat is ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) (HK:0763).
China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker was forced to cease major operations in April after the United States slapped it with a supplier ban saying it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
ZTE is in the process of getting the ban lifted and recently announced a new board, but its settlement deal with the United States is facing opposition from some lawmakers in Washington. 
IMPACT ON CHINA MOBILE ""VERY TINY""
While ZTE has been hit hard by the ban as almost a third of the components used in its equipment come from U.S. suppliers, China Mobile, according to an analyst, will not be hurt much if blocked since it derives most of its income from home.
The impact of the ruling on China Mobile's business is ""very tiny"", said Ramakrishna Maruvada, a Singapore-based analyst with Daiwa Securities. ""This doesn't move the needle."" 
China Mobile Communications Corp, a state-controlled firm, owned almost 73 percent of China Mobile as of December, according to Thomson Reuters data.
China Mobile shares closed down 2 percent on Tuesday, their lowest close in more than four years, after news of the NTIA recommendation to block the firm's U.S. entry. 
The NTIA said its assessment rested ""in large part on China's record of intelligence activities and economic espionage targeting the U.S., along with China Mobile's size and technical and financial resources.""
It said the company was ""subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government"" and that its application posed ""substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks in the current national security environment"". 
U.S. senators and spy chiefs warned in February that China was trying, via means such as telecommunications firms, to gain access to sensitive U.S. technologies and intellectual properties.

Such concerns, however, are not deterring China's  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) which is set to press ahead with plans to enter the United States next year, saying its U.S. connections should help it skirt political resistance.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 06:13AM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor's union votes to strike after wage talks fail,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) unionized workers in South Korea voted on Tuesday to strike over stalled wage talks, adding to the woes of the automaker that is bracing for potential new U.S. tariffs amid falling profits.
Its shares slid to eight-year lows after the union, which has voted to strike every year for the past six years, said on Monday that nearly three-fourths of its 44,782 voters voted in favor of the strike action.
""We have not been able to narrow differences in key issues, making it difficult to reach a preliminary (wage) deal easily,"" the union said in a statement.
Union negotiators later on Tuesday decided to hold off on starting the strike until July 10, when they will discuss a strike plan again, a union spokesman said. 
The union walked out of the wage negotiations in late June, after  Hyundai Motor  proposed wage increases and bonuses which the union said fell short of expectations.
This year, the union is demanding a 5.3 percent increase in basic monthly wage, lower than the 7 percent it asked for last year and compared to South Korea's annual inflation rate of 1.9 percent for 2017. It also wants performance pay totaling 30 percent of the automaker’s 2017 net profit.
The demands come at a time when South Korea's automobile industry is experiencing rough weather. The country's vehicle production fell 3 percent 41.15 million in 2017, its lowest level since the 2009 global economic downturn.
The union at General Motors' (N:GM) domestic unit, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy about two months ago, has agreed to freeze base wages and skip bonuses for this year as well as trim benefits.
Hyundai Motor's net profit halved to an almost six-year low in January-March, hit by bleak U.S. and China sales. Although China sales are modestly recovering, its U.S. sales will remain weak, weighing on earnings, analysts have said. 
""Business conditions are tough as net profit continues to decrease,"" Ha Eon-tae, an executive, said during the talks, according to the union's internal note seen by Reuters.
""We have taken into account the U.S.-China trade war and U.S. protectionist tariff policy (when proposing the wages),"" he said, according to the note.
PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS?
Hyundai Motor declined to comment.
Its shares fell as much as 3.2 percent on Tuesday to their lowest level since April 2010, before ending down 1.2 percent in a flat wider market. (KS11)
""While the strike will help reduce inventory for some low-selling cars, it will disrupt production of higher-demand SUVs,"" said Cho Soo-hong, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. 
""It is difficult for the company to give generous bonuses when profits are deteriorating. Potential U.S. tariffs may also force Hyundai to boost U.S. production, which will lead to reduced local output,"" he said.
The United States in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs. 
Hyundai Motor said over the weekend that the U.S. tariffs of up to 25 percent ""would be devastating to Hyundai Motor"", adding to its U.S. production costs by about 10 percent.
Hyundai Motor, the world’s fifth-biggest automaker together with affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270), has been hit by strikes in all but four years since the union was formed in 1987. In most of the years, striking workers and management have struck compromise wage deals to restore normalcy to operations. 

The union spokesman said on Tuesday talks with the company will resume on Wednesday, with a goal to reach a compromise deal before summer holidays start on July 30.

It said it now expected Germany's passenger car market to grow by 1 percent to around 3.5 million vehicles this year, compared with a previous guidance for 3.4 million.
""Despite economic and political uncertainty, the German automotive industry remains strong,"" VDA President Bernhard Mattes told journalists at a news conference on Tuesday, according to a prepared speech text.
In June, new car registrations were 4 percent higher than in the year-earlier period.
Germany's autos sector is being rattled by a threat by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports of cars assembled in the European Union.
VDA's Mattes called on politicians to seek a transatlantic compromise that would see both the U.S. and Europe take a step back from tariffs and would comply with the rules set out by the World Trade Organization.

""But if the U.S. should nonetheless unilaterally increase tariffs there will have to be a response,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.) 
You have no doubt heard the name Zuckerberg. But what you may not know is that the family has more than one media mogul around the holiday dinner table.
Mark's sister Randi, 36, was formerly at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) but left more than a decade ago. She now authors books, produces TV shows, invests in start-ups and raises two kids at the same time.
Her busy to-do list is the subject of her new book, “Pick Three,"" about how she does all that without pulling her hair out. Randi spoke with Reuters for the latest in our “Life Lessons” series.
Q: What was an early job that you took a lesson from?
A: I was a hostess and waitress in a restaurant, the Central Square (NYSE:SQ) Café in Scarsdale, New York. To this day, it completely changed the way I view anyone in a service role. I always treat waiters and waitresses with respect, because I have been in those shoes. Everyone should have a job like that at some point in their life, because it gives you a lot of empathy.
Q: What was the best career advice you got?
A: I was told, ‘Randi, be careful what you get good at.’ I didn’t understand what that meant at the time. I was an eager beaver right out of college, and if I was told to fax something I wanted to be the best faxer in the world. But the point of that advice was, if people just see you as one thing, then it becomes very hard to think of you as something else.
Q: As a woman, have you found the start-up world particularly difficult?
A: We definitely still live in a world where it is harder for women to raise money. That is our unfortunate reality, which I would like to see change. I think a lot of people would have taken my ideas more seriously if I was not a woman, which was one reason why I brought on a male business partner. Now I do a lot of investing in other women.
Q: A lot of your efforts have focused on entertainment - Why?
A: Entertainment is definitely the Wild West when it comes to media. There’s so much content out there, in so many different forms, that it is hard for people to discover something that’s really good. My most recent show is called Dot, an animated cartoon about a techie girl, in collaboration with the Jim Henson Company.
Q: For your investment portfolio, what are you looking for in budding start-ups?
A: For me it is all about the person. I get pitched five or 10 things every single week. But all businesses change, and nothing ever looks the same in five years. One thing that doesn’t change is the person I’m backing, so that is almost 100 percent of what I’m looking for.
Q: What is the philosophy behind your new book?
A: I am always asked how I balance it all, being a mom and an entrepreneur. And honestly, I really don’t. Life is a game of ruthless prioritization, and you can’t have it all every single day. So if there are five categories – work, sleep, friends, family, fitness – pick three for any given day, and you can do those well. Don’t waste your time feeling guilty about the other two. And then tomorrow, pick a different three.
Q: How do you focus your charity efforts?
A: I am passionate about the arts – I have always been into singing, theater, musicals. I even got to perform on Broadway a few years ago, which was a bucket-list item. 
Q: What lessons do you pass along to your two boys?

A: They are seven and three, so basically we are just in survival mode right now. One of the reasons I love living in New York City is that you can walk out the door and see every kind of person, of every socioeconomic status, speaking every language. So I want my boys to feel empathy and kindness for everyone, to see the world’s problems and try to make it a better place. I would consider that a success.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets (O:CBOE) will open a European Union stock trading venue in Amsterdam as Britain leaves the bloc, adding to the Dutch city's Brexit spoils.
Success in attracting Cboe Europe, the largest pan-Europe stock exchange by market share, is a major win for Amsterdam and helps counter a trend for banks and funds to pick rival centers such as Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg.
Amsterdam has already won business from venues including Tradeweb and MarketAxess, wooed in part by the city's connectivity speeds. Others, such as the London Stock Exchange's  Turquoise, have yet to set out their plans.
""We believe that the Netherlands is supportive of competitive and open financial market infrastructure and we feel Amsterdam is a fantastic location to establish our EU venue,"" Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said in a statement.
It also said it had ""longstanding and good relations"" with the Dutch regulator and central bank, ""which have a deep understanding of the equities and derivatives markets"".
Cboe, which already has a stake in Amsterdam-based pan-European clearing house EuroCCP, said it had filed an application with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets to establish an equities trading venue.
Cboe said it needed to set up the new venue to ensure continued access to European clients after Brexit, but would still operate its existing Registered Investment Exchange in Britain and look to offer similar services on both venues.
The Amsterdam exchange would be staffed by a mix of local hires and staff moved from other locations, a spokeswoman said, without giving further details.
Cboe has around 80 staff in London, Hemsley told Reuters, adding that the exchange picked Amsterdam over Dublin.

The announcement comes as senior British politicians meet on Friday to agree their position on the shape of Britain's future relations with the bloc, and as many financial services firms continue to plan for a collapse in talks.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives settled a row over migration and gave some respite to investors facing a rage of political worries including trade tensions with the United States.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.6 percent by 0833 GMT with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) posting the best performance with a 0.9 percent rise.
The dispute over immigration had threatened to topple Merkel's fragile governing coalition but in a breakthrough late on Monday evening, her rebellious interior minister dropped his threat to resign after five hours of talks.
Asian shares, which had sustained heavy falls overnight, particularly in China, recouped some of their losses before European bourses opened, helping restore sentiment. 
Chinese financial markets have been jittery ahead of a July 6 deadline, when the U.S. is set to slap tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products.
""Calls for a positive start are helped by a positive close on Wall Street and only mild losses in Asia overnight,"" wrote Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. 
Miner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) fell more than 10 percent after it said a subsidiary had received a U.S. Department of Justice subpoena requesting documents and records on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. money-laundering statutes. 
The documents requested from subsidiary Glencore Ltd relate to the group's business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Venezuela from 2007 to present, Glencore said, adding it was reviewing the subpoena.
Another big faller was BE Semiconductor, the Dutch equipment maker (AS:BESI) lost over 8 percent after cutting revenue forecast. 

 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) rose 1.3 percent and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) up 2.1 percent after the latter agreed to sell its equity markets and commodities business (EMC (NYSE:EMC)) to the French bank.

Mason Capital's claim follows a similar action by U.S. activist fund Elliott Management which in May sought $670 million in compensation from South Korea over its role in the Samsung affiliates' merger.
An official at South Korea's justice ministry said on Tuesday that Mason Capital filed a notice of intent seeking a resolution through the Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism.
The June 7 dated notice, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argued that the South Korean government's influence over the decision of the country's largest pension fund, the National Pension Service (NPS), which approved the $8 billion merger of Samsung affiliates Samsung C&T (KS:028260) and Cheil Industries in 2015, caused damages to Mason Capital Management's investors. 
""Korean government officials, from the highest level, through to the NPS, an organ of the State, acted to manipulate the vote motivated by bribery, favoritism to the Lee Family, and open hostility toward non-Korean investors,"" the notice said.
The merger deal was at the center of the corruption scandal involving South Korean politicians and business leaders, leading to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye and arrest of Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee. 
""Mason Capital Management's claim is similar to that of Elliott's and the ministry is putting our utmost effort to resolve the issue,"" the justice ministry official added.

Mason Capital could not be reached immediately for a comment.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>","China seeks to soothe markets as trade angst rattles stocks, yuan","By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank moved to calm jittery financial markets on Tuesday after the yuan dropped through the psychologically significant 6.7 to the dollar mark, hitting its lowest in almost a year as anxieties over U.S. trade frictions deepened.
Stocks also sank in morning trade as Beijing and Washington hurtled toward an end-of-week tariff deadline that has kept investors in China nervous, although they recouped their losses and ended the day in positive territory.
Chinese currency  and equity markets have been on edge ahead of July 6, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods kick in. Beijing has said it would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. products.
The sustained fall in stocks and the yuan appeared to be rattling the authorities.
In a statement posted on the website of the People's Bank of China, Governor Yi Gang said the central bank was closely watching fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and would seek to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level. Cross-border capital flows were under control, Yi said.
State-controlled media earlier called the fall in stocks an ""irrational overreaction"" and urged investors not to panic over the growing trade frictions.
After the morning drop, market participants suspected the central bank of intervening in the currency market to support the yuan.
The yuan fell to 6.7204 per dollar, its weakest since Aug. 7, 2017 and the first time it dropped below 6.7 since Aug. 9, 2017, before crossing back and forth over the line. 
By 0803 GMT, it had recovered to 6.6858 though the currency has lost more than 4 percent of its value against the dollar since mid-June.
""It's a crucial day for the yuan today given it weakened past 6.7 per dollar,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.
""Let's see what level the yuan closes today, and see whether the central bank would take out some measures to stabilize the exchange rate.""
In August last year, 6.7 was the level around which China's authorities relaxed restrictions on the yuan, a move that was followed by a gradual appreciation over the next 8 months.
Four traders told Reuters that major state-owned banks were seen swapping yuan for dollars in the forwards market on Tuesday and immediately selling some of them into spot market, which helped support the Chinese currency.
Traders and economists say major state-owned banks sometimes act on behalf of the central bank in the foreign exchange interbank market.
The central bank did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the yuan's moves.
""It feels like the state-owned banks are stocking up on bullets to prevent the yuan from falling too much,"" said one trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.
The central bank earlier set the midpoint  at 6.6497 yuan per dollar, its weakest fixing in about 10 months.
Speaking in the morning at an event to mark the one-year anniversary of a scheme that links Hong Kong and mainland bond markets, PBOC deputy governor and head of the foreign exchange regulator Pan Gongsheng said China was confident it could keep the yuan basically stable and at a ""reasonable"" level.
Traders said statements from the PBOC officials went some way toward calming the market.
TRADE CONDITIONS
State-run media also sought to reassure investors with the Economic Daily describing U.S.-China trade frictions as ""a test"" the economy had to undergo during its rise.
""We have long anticipated and prepared for this...The impact on the Chinese economy is within a controllable range,"" the newspaper said.However, the outlook for Sino-U.S. trade relations was further clouded on Tuesday by Washington's moves to block China Mobile (HK:0941) from offering services in the U.S. and news that growth in China's exports to the United States has slowed significantly this year.
Analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note on Tuesday that while concerns about the trade conflict were creating a drag on the yuan, they did not expect the government to use the exchange rate as a weapon in the trade dispute.
""The uncertainty related to the trade conflict, the weak growth outlook and the easing bias in Chinese monetary policy suggest a weaker renminbi in the coming quarters,"" they wrote.
In equities, the blue chip CSI300 Index (CSI300) slumped by more than 2 percent in the morning trading session, and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) was down more than 1 percent before staging an afternoon comeback. By the end of the day, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.39 percent while the CSI300 had risen 0.03 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) was hammered after a one-day hiatus on Monday to mark the day that the former British colony was returned to China. It was down by around 3 percent before clawing back some losses in the afternoon to close 1.4 percent lower.
Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities, said the recovery in China stocks was a ""technical rally"" that followed the recent selloff.

""There is still downside potential for the blue-chip stocks amid trade war and economic worries,"" Yan said.

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",China's Stocks Stabilize With Yuan Amid Signs of Intervention,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s stocks clawed back losses in afternoon trading and the yuan pared its drop after sinking through a key level, stoking speculation that authorities taking steps to halt a rout. 
The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4 percent at the close after earlier plunging as much as 1.9 percent. The yuan pared declines after sliding through 6.7 per dollar, where traders and analysts had expected intervention from the central bank. Banks and insurers led the equity rebound in Shanghai, which came after shares plumbed a new two-year low to approach levels last seen during panic selling in early 2016.
“It looks like national team buying,"" said Steven Leung, Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. executive director in Hong Kong. “Also, the declines were too much, so there should be some bargain hunting.""
The national team, as China’s state funds are called, have previously stepped in to stabilize the market during routs, or to lift sentiment ahead of important political events. They had appeared absent as the Shanghai gauge fell into a bear market last month.
Worries that a trade dispute with the U.S. will damage an economy already struggling with the effects of a government deleveraging campaign have sent Chinese markets into a tailspin, helping erase $2 trillion from the value of stocks since a January peak. The yuan’s weakness since mid-June, a period in which it’s been the world’s worst-performing major currency, has intensified the selloff.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang also helped to soothe rattled nerves on Tuesday, reiterating that China will keep the currency stable at an equilibrium level. That, and comments by another PBOC official earlier in the day, are the first clear statement on the currency by the central bank since the yuan slump intensified in mid-June.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.7 percent as of 3:27 p.m. in the city as markets reopened after a holiday. The yuan traded at 6.6811 per dollar after earlier falling to 6.7204. Some Chinese major banks sold the dollar in the swaps market, according to four traders. China’s currency has retreated more than 4 percent against the greenback since June 14, the most among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The trade dispute will move up a notch on Friday when the U.S. is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $16 billion potentially following. The size could increase to another $200 billion of imports if China retaliates.
“Today is only part of a wider market rebound which may or may not be sustainable,"" said Liao Zhiming, analyst with Tianfeng Securities Co. “The real test is the Friday, when investors are waiting for the shoe to drop with Trump’s tariffs.""

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 03:22AM ET</span>",Honda's China vehicle sales drop for fifth straight month,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co’s China vehicle sales fell 6 percent in June from a year earlier to 107,985 units as the company continues to reel under the impact of a quality issue earlier this year.
Sales fell for a fifth straight month in June, the Tokyo-based carmaker said on Tuesday.
Honda's sales took a hit after a quality issue surfaced in its popular CR-V sport-utility vehicle earlier this year. Though the company resolved the issue in May, sales for that month were down 15.3 percent.
During the first half of 2018, Honda's sales volume in the world's biggest auto market fell 6.4 percent from the same period a year earlier to 609,100 vehicles.
The quality issue stemmed mainly from excess un-combusted petrol accumulating in the CR-V engine’s lubricant oil pan.
In early March, Honda decided to halt sales of CR-V and noted it may have to do the same with Civic after a Chinese quality watchdog rejected the automaker’s plan to recall 350,000 cars to fix the problem.
The issue was resolved after the watchdog in May allowed Honda to recall both the vehicles. However, Honda was not able to resume sales of the CR-V until late May.
The pace of drop in CR-V sales has since then slowed, signaling an imminent reversal. June sales stood at 7,135 vehicles, down 1.8 percent from a year ago.
Honda sales are down across products, in part because the company's image was hit by the CR-V issue, analysts said. 

Sales of some of the company's models such as the XR-V subcompact SUV were also under pressure from competition, they added.

It was not immediately clear why the shares rose.

China's No.2 telecom equipment maker was forced to cease major operations in April after the U.S. slapped it with a supplier ban saying it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE is in the process of getting the ban lifted and announced a new board last week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Chinese stocks went into a tail spin on Tuesday as turbulence gripped equity markets in Asia, which sank to nine-month lows amid heightened anxiety a bitter trade dispute between the United States and major economies could derail global growth. 
Speculation was rife China's central bank was intervening in the currency market to staunch losses and prevent a potentially destabilizing sell-off in the yuan, while stocks came off a searing sell-off in the morning. 
Chinese financial markets have been jittery ahead of a July 6 deadline, when the U.S. is set to slap tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. 
The trade row between the United States and major economies has rattled financial markets over several weeks, with no sign U.S. President Donald Trump is about to back down from his 'America First' protectionism policies that many fear will harm the global economy. 
The European stock futures point to gains of 0.3 percent in France's CAC and Britain's FTSE and 0.5 percent in Germany's DAX.
The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan tumbled as much as 1.4 percent to its lowest since September 29, before cutting some of the losses to be down 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei average also recovered from a 0.9 percent fall and was last off 0.1 percent to a near three-month closing low.
Chinese stocks were hit the hardest, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index diving as much as 3.3 percent to its lowest level in ten months, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed as much as 1.9 percent to hit a fresh 28 month low. The Hong Kong market remained choppy and was last down 1.9 percent, while the Shanghai bourse edged up 0.05 percent.
""It's not clear yet if the trade row will derail the global economy as a whole but it's already clear that it will harm Chinese companies at least,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. 
""That is why we've seen Chinese yuan and Chinese stocks have suffered selloffs. I think this will continue at least until the July 6 deadline.""
The Chinese yuan, on a downward spiral since mid-June, slipped past 6.7 per dollar in early trading on Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 9, 2017 before paring losses on talk of intervention by the Chinese central bank. 
Four traders told Reuters that major state-owned banks were seen swapping yuan for dollars in the forwards market and immediately selling some of them into spot market, which helped support the Chinese currency. Traders and economists say major state-owned banks sometimes act on behalf of the central bank in the foreign exchange interbank market.
The central bank put the midpoint roughly in line with market expectations at 6.6497 yuan per dollar, its weakest level in about 10 months, setting the stage for the day's drop.
The yuan was last traded at 6.6960 per dollar. 
""I detected increasing alarm over trade tensions and a lot of nervousness about a full blown trade war, which comes at a bad time for China where the economy is undergoing a downdraft at the same time the United States is seeing a sharp upturn,"" Aninda Mitra, Singapore-based senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management, who visited Shanghai last week, said in an emailed note to media.
Trump told the World Trade Organization on Monday that ""we'll be doing something"" if the United States is not treated properly, just hours after the European Union said that U.S. automotive tariffs would hurt its own vehicle industry and prompt retaliation.
Also on Monday, Washington moved to block China Mobile from offering services to the U.S. telecommunications market, recommending its application be rejected because the government-owned firm posed national security risks.
Officials in China, the epicenter of the international trade row, have warned the United States that the tit-for-tat tariffs on each others' goods will ultimately prove detrimental for American businesses and jobs. [L4N1TN1RH]
Elsewhere in currency markets, the euro, which had been pressured by political uncertainty in Germany, pared losses after Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives settled a row over migration that threatened to topple her governing coalition after interior minister Horst Seehofer dropped his threat to quit. 
The euro last traded at $1.1650, after shedding 0.45 percent overnight.
The dollar last stood at 110.97 yen, giving up gains following sharp falls in Chinese shares.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at record lows of 1.5 percent, as widely expected, at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and showed no hint of hiking anytime soon.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe said ""one uncertainty regarding the global outlook stems from the direction of international trade policy in the United States,"" cautioning that the recent U.S.-China trade tensions may pose a risk.
China is Australia's major export market and its currency, the Australia dollar, is considered a liquid proxy for China-related risk.
The Aussie dollar came off a 1-1/2-year low of $0.7311 plumbed overnight, fetching $0.7368. 
On commodity markets, copper edged higher on Tuesday but was still near a seven-month low reached in the previous session as the trade tensions raised concerns about demand.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>","Australia regulator calls for overdraft ban, fee-free banking for indigenous clients","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate watchdog called for a ban on debit card overdraft services for low-income indigenous customers, saying their poor understanding of fees left them paying unreasonably high amounts for basic banking services.
Banks should provide ""fee-free accounts"" to such clients and increase efforts to manage cultural challenges, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said at an ongoing misconduct inquiry into the financial services sector - the largest contributor to the country's GDP.
Halfway through a year of scheduled hearings, the inquiry has already led to damaging revelations of careless and at times fraudulent lending practices, wiping out tens of billions of dollars from Australian bank valuations, spurring major asset sales and leading to executive departures.
The inquiry is now turning its focus to the financial exclusion of indigenous customers who are ending up with unsuitable products amid predatory sales practices.
Low financial literacy is among the major challenges faced by financial institutions when servicing these communities, said Nathan Boyle, who investigates indigenous issues for ASIC.
""People tend not to understand ... what an informal overdraft is. If they use the ATM card to withdraw money and the money comes out, then people tend to think that they did have money in their account which is where people are getting caught out,"" Boyle told the inquiry on Tuesday.
Sometimes a A$20 ($14.67) fee is 10 percent of the person's fortnightly income, Boyle said, adding that free accounts would give people access to only the funds they have in their bank, helping them avoid expensive overdraft fees.
Boyle also pointed out that some financial companies were taking advantage of cultural differences, such as the importance of funeral services in Aboriginal culture, to sell funeral and life insurance plans.
About half of funeral insurance policies in remote indigenous communities have been sold to people 20 years old or younger, lawyers assisting the inquiry said, citing ASIC data.
Boyle said an ASIC review found a unit of Clearview Wealth (AX:CVW) had used the tendency of indigenous people to express agreement to questions they did not understand to sell insurances.
For instance, when a telephone representative asked for bank details, the indigenous client obliged and ended up paying for funeral and insurance policies they never wanted, Boyle added.
""People will provide details that they're asked for by someone they see in a position of authority ... to the point they've provided enough information to have entered into a contract even though they never intended to,"" he said.
A Clearview Wealth spokeswoman said the company had unreservedly apologized to any customers affected, noting the unit had been closed in 2017.
Clearview Wealth is working with ASIC to remediate any customers who were adversely affected, she added.

In dispensing with commissions for staff who sell the company's own wealth products to customers, Macquarie joins the country's No. 2 and No. 3 banks, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), which have said they would stop the practice.
Australia's financial services industry is experiencing heightened scrutiny as a public inquiry called a Royal Commission airs almost daily allegations of questionable conduct from board-level deception of a regulator to predatory lending to vulnerable consumers.
Though Macquarie has not faced questioning, the inquiry has heard concerns that private wealth advisers are selling products without disclosing they are receiving commissions for the sales, prompting analysts to speculate so-called ""conflicted"" advice will be banned as a result.
Macquarie said about 17,000 customers of its private wealth and private bank would benefit from the decision to axe the commissions from April 1, 2019.
""This is an important step to provide our clients with a transparent product and service offering in line with changing stakeholder and client expectations and our commitment to industry best practice,"" Macquarie said in a statement.
Laws introduced in July 2013 let banks reward their financial advisers with commissions for recommending their own investment and insurance products, provided the clients hired the adviser before that date.
But the Royal Commission has revealed banks have relied heavily on the so-called grandfathered provision to charge ongoing fees to clients, thousands of whom have not received the advisory services they paid for.

Last month, Westpac said it would stop paying commissions for conflicted advice for more than 140,000 customers from Oct. 1. In May, ANZ, which has sold most of its advisory network to IOOF (AX:IFL), said it would stop paying bonuses to financial planners for selling its products.

Toys ""R"" Us stores across the United States marked their final day in business on Friday.
The store closings impacted the quarter's statistics ""more than any other retailer has in any quarter over the last nine years"", Reis said.
The report said 55 of 77 metros reported a rise in vacancy compared with the second quarter last year, when U.S. retail real estate vacancies were at 10 percent.
""After withstanding the hundreds if not thousands of store closings over the last 18 months, the neighborhood and community shopping center industry suffered its worst quarter in nine years,"" the Reis report said.
Net absorption was a negative of 3.8 million square feet, compared with 909,000 square feet in the year-ago quarter.
Reis said it does not expect the vacancy rate to improve in the near future.
The retail statistics somewhat mirror the retail employment numbers, with the sector experiencing positive job growth every month in 2018, and adding 125,100 jobs over the last 12 months, the report said.
The national average asking rents edged 0.2 percent higher, as did the effective rent for the quarter, Reis said.
Only 780,000 square feet of new construction was completed in the quarter, a 79.7 percent drop from a year earlier, according to the report.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>",Tesla's all-nighter to hit production goal fails to convince Wall Street,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) burning the midnight oil to hit a long-elusive target of making 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week failed to convince Wall Street that the electric carmaker could sustain that production pace, sending shares down 2.3 percent on Monday.
Tesla met the target by running around the clock and pulling workers from other projects, workers said. The company also took the unprecedented step of setting up a new production line inside a tent on the campus of its Fremont factory, details of which Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted last month.
Tesla's heavily-shorted shares rose as much as 6.4 percent to $364.78 in early trading, but sank after several analysts questioned whether Tesla would be able to sustain the Model 3 production momentum, which is crucial for the long-term financial health of the company.
""In the interim, we do not see this production rate as operationally or financially sustainable,"" said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy. ""However, over time, we expect the manufacturing rate to become sustainable and even rise.""
Levy cut CFRA's rating on Tesla stock to ""sell"" from ""hold."" 
Tesla, which Chief Executive Elon Musk hailed on Sunday as having become a ""real car company,"" said it now expects to boost production to 6,000 Model 3s per week by late August, signaling confidence about resolving technical and assembly issues that have plagued the company for months.
Tesla also reaffirmed a positive cash flow and profit forecast for the year and announced that Doug Field, senior vice president of engineering, was stepping down after five years with the company.
Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3. Problems with an over-reliance on automation, battery issues and other bottlenecks have potentially compromised Tesla's position in the electric car market as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.
While UBS analyst Colin Langan said there was some relief the company hit the Model 3 production target, he noted that second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 40,740 missed his expectation for 51,000 and the consensus estimate of 49,000. 
He also questioned whether the company could keep up the faster production and its profit outlook. 
""We're very worried about quality and if you read the reports online there's significant quality issues. They still haven't proven they can produce these profitably. The math is very challenging in getting to a sustained profit,"" said Langan.
Model 3 production tripled to 28,578 in the company's second quarter from the previous quarter, Tesla said. 
The company said 11,166 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter, and would be delivered early next quarter.
Reservations at the end of the second quarter stood at roughly 420,000. Tesla has delivered 28,386 Model 3 cars to date. Model 3 reservations totaled 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.
The company said it expects orders to grow faster than the production rate after it starts allowing potential customers to see and test drive Model 3s at local stores.
Despite originally touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced model as it tries to come out of ""production hell."" 
The prices of Tesla's three convertible bonds were little moved by hitting the production goal, suggesting that share price volatility discouraged bondholders from converting their securities into equity despite the positive production news.
As of Friday’s close, 34.83 million Tesla shares or 27.5 percent of the shares available for trading were sold short and investors did not appear to be covering their positions ahead of Monday's announcement, according Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners a financial analytics firm. 
""You wonder are traders maxed out on risk on Tesla. At a certain point you're gorged. You can't take another bite,"" he said.
Tesla's milestone achievement did not alter a recommendation to short Tesla stock from David Kudla, founder and chief executive of Mainstay Capital Management in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Selling shares short is a bet the price will fall.
""The push to meet these self-imposed targets makes one question what cost was incurred to build these cars and how was quality adversely impacted,"" said Kudla, who is personally short Tesla stock.

""Whether somebody is short at $361 or $300 they're going to be fine.""

“There is a bottom,” Ramakrishna Maruvada, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., said in an interview. He upgraded the shares to hold from sell last week, citing the plunge this year as evidence that the challenges from rival carriers and from entertainment platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). have been adequately discounted.
Kaliaropoulos, who built a reputation as a turnaround executive by leading Zain Saudi Arabia, takes over July 9 and will have plenty to work on at the company. The entrance of a fourth player, TPG Telecom Ltd., in Singapore’s mobile phone market is intensifying competition for subscribers, just as StarHub’s bundling model in which it offers access to film, television and broadband services, is being challenged by streaming powerhouses like Netflix. The stock was moved from the MSCI Singapore Index in May to the small cap gauge.
There are “deep-rooted issues plaguing the company,” said Maruvada. “Its failure to adapt to changes in the external environment, and ineffective execution of its business plan” have contributed to the tumbling stock price.
Earnings per share probably slumped 38 percent to $S0.03 in the quarter ended June, according to the average analyst estimate, an eighth straight quarter of decline.
StarHub “has always been and will continue to be committed to driving the business and delivering shareholder value,” Jeannie Ong, the company’s chief strategic partnership officer said in an emailed response. “For example, we are boosting network and customer service quality to drive cost efficiencies and accelerating organic and inorganic growth in our enterprise business.”
The company declined to comment on the incoming CEO’s plans for the company ahead of his start date.
Still, at least four brokerages have upgraded the stock over the past month. The carrier is trading at an enterprise value about 6.2 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with the about 13 times average for companies in the Straits Times Index.
Rival Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. has also faced rising competition, with its shares slumping 15 percent this year, while M1 Ltd., the other established wireless carrier in the city state has slumped 11 percent.
To spark a rally, Kaliaropoulos will have to address the consumer segment including the Pay-TV and mobile service that “cast a shadow on the whole business,” said Sachin Mittal, an analyst at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. based in Singapore.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Loeb's Third Point takes new approach in battle with Nestle,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - For a year, billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has watched quietly from afar as Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) tries to energize its business. But his patience has worn thin and he has been telling associates and his own investors that time is now up for the world's No. 1 food company.
On Sunday, Loeb fired off a letter and 34-page presentation to Nestle's chief executive officer and board chairman urging them to sell more of the businesses that do not fit and untangle its corporate structure.
Loeb criticized the company's ""muddled strategic approach"" and called for the company to split internally into three units: beverages, nutrition and grocery. Loeb wants the company to focus on ""nutrition, health and wellness"" and sell pieces that do not fit, including its stake in French personal care company L'Oreal SA.
Nestle said on Monday, in response to Loeb's public critiques, that its ""board and management take all shareholders' perspectives seriously and welcome their continued input."" The company declined to elaborate.
With Nestle's share price down 8 percent over the last year, Loeb underlined that he is not happy with the company's effort to buy back shares and that the sale of the U.S. confectionery business to a rival has not gone far enough.
He also launched a website, www.Nestlenow.com, to push his case publicly, marking only the third time his $18 billion firm Third Point LLC has taken such a step in its 23-year history. It was roughly a year ago that Third Point made its roughly $3 billion investment in Nestle.
To some, the moves suggest an aggressive U.S.-based hedge fund manager taking his playbook to Europe where shareholders have been appeased with slower progress for longer. To Loeb's own clients and some friends, the campaign illustrates how much the 56-year old manager has transformed not only his business but himself since the 2008-2009 financial crisis when Third Point came close to going out of business. 
""A decade ago Dan Loeb would have been writing a scathing critique of the CEO and possibly calling him names and threatening his job,"" said one investor, who asked not to be identified because the funds are private.
Six years ago Loeb took aim at Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) CEO Scott Thompson's record at Stonehill College, uncovering discrepancies on his resume that ultimately cost him his job. A decade earlier, Loeb wrote to Potlatch Corp CEO Pendleton Siegel referencing his ""atrocious management record and inexplicable insouciance.""
Now the message to Nestle's Swiss headquarters and its German CEO, Mark Schneider, were far more measured, with plenty of suggestions on how get the share price moving higher again and no personal attacks or embarrassing anecdotes.
KINDER, GENTLER?
Investors agree that Loeb is trying a different tack these days, understanding the need to galvanize other investors to back his calls for change and to get management to cooperate with him. Ultimately, several investors said, Nestle is owned by its shareholders and if they are unhappy with management's progress, something needs to be done.
""Dan is about the power of the argument,"" said Ken Squire, who tracks activists at research firm 13D Monitor. ""And here he is offering an alternative argument to shareholders.""
With some, the message is already resonating.
Another investor who owns 8 million Nestle shares but asked not to be identified publicly said on Monday that his firm is sending a letter to Schneider and his team to throw their support behind Loeb.
""The board should be asking whether Loeb's analysis is correct and not be concerned about his tactics and whether he is ratcheting up the pressure or not,"" the investor said.
To be sure, there are critics who say Loeb may be pushing Nestle publicly now because his $3 billion position has not delivered the kind of payday Loeb or his investors want.
In the first six months of 2018, Loeb's Third Point Partners fund returned 1 percent, an investor said. The average hedge fund lost roughly 1 percent during that time, Hedge Fund Research data shows.
But Loeb's average annualized returns are still some of the best in the industry, averaging around 18 percent a year at the Third Point Partners fund. Institutional Investor just named Third Point hedge fund manager of the year. And Squire said his data shows Third Point returning roughly 21 percent on average on positions where it has taken a 5 percent or higher stake.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries that a broadening trade war between the United States and China will upend the global supply chain are prompting some U.S. fund managers to buy shares of companies they believe will shield them from such disruptions. 
Managers from Baron Funds, Thornburg Investment Management, and James Advantage Funds are among those that are buying or adding to positions in companies ranging from cloud-based companies like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to London-based online food delivery company Just Eat Plc that get most of their revenues in their domestic markets, all in an effort to sidestep possible disruptions caused by trade tariffs. 
""We've positioned the portfolio to minimize the risk of exposure to companies that might be more directly impacted,"" said Brad Slingerlend, a portfolio manager of the $2.8 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology fund. 
Slingerlend has been reducing his weight in semiconductor companies overall, he said, while adding to Chinese internet companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings Ltd on declines. At the same time, Salesforce.com is now the second-largest position in his portfolio, helped in part by the 31.4 percent gain in the company's shares for the year-to-date. 
""The trend to more and more cloud computing is going to march on despite whether a trade war will happen with China,"" he said.
The U.S. is targeting $34 billion of Chinese goods for tariffs to take effect on July 6, and has threatened tens of billions of dollars more for similar duties. That has helped sink the shares of chipmakers and other industries that rely heavily on a Chinese supply chain. The $1.8-billion iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF has dropped 5.2 percent over the last week, more than double the 2-percent drop in the broad S&P 500 index. 
Yet there are also signs that some investors are picking up stocks that they think have been unduly hit by the tariff worries. 
Fund flows into the PHLX Semiconductor ETF, for instance, rose 5 percent in the week ending June 27 from the week before, even as its shares fell 6.9 percent over the same period, according to Lipper data. That positive inflow was more than 5 times larger than the 0.7-percent flow into the broad SPDR XLT ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector as a whole. 
Michael Lippert, portfolio manager of the $395 million Baron Opportunity fund, said that he is waiting for deeper declines in the stock market from trade concerns before adding to his positions. 
""If we have another few days of pullback, I absolutely have my list of companies that are hitting the price targets I want,"" he said. 
Among his new positions is a stake in $395 million integrated circuit maker Aquantia Corp, which makes chips used in data centers and automated driving. Shares of the company are up 4 percent for the year, and are down 25 percent over the last 3 months in part due to trade worries.
""In a hot market like this, you want to find a company that's been overlooked,"" Lippert said. 
Sean Koung Sun, a co-portfolio manager of the $1.8 billion Thornburg International Growth fund, said that his fund is focusing on technology companies that rely on domestic demand more than trade. 
He has been adding to his position in companies such as TAL Education Group, which operates online and in-person after-school tutoring centers in China. Shares of the company are up 22 percent for the year to date, including a 12.5 decline in the last month. 
""This is a way to reach the lower-tier cities in China, and technology makes it frictionless,"" Sun said. 
He is also increasing his position in Just Eat, an online food delivery application which operates in markets including the UK, France, Italy and Mexico. Shares of the company are now down 1.3 percent year-to-date after its shares fell sharply Wednesday following cautious guidance from the company's capital markets day. 

""The trade tensions have escalated and de-escalated and we're trying to find high quality companies that will do well in any environment,"" Sun said. ""We're trying to be tactical and focused more on the long-term potential.""

The companies said in April they were in talks to set up a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense division and possibly its business jet unit. The tricky work of divvying up the three business segments of Embraer had been delaying the deal.

845,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Mexico Investors Wait for More Lopez Obrador Words With Caution,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico investors used to watching asset prices swing on the words of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are in for five more months of much the same.
The nation’s unusually long period between elections and the transition of power mean traders will be obsessing about the next president’s often contradictory speeches, without the ability to see what actual policies he pursues until his Dec. 1 inauguration.
That dynamic will add to volatility in Mexican markets -- which posted moderate declines after Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory Sunday that will also bring many of his allies to Congress. Investors need to understand if the leftist firebrand will proceed with the market- unfriendly measures featured in his campaign -- like halting a $13 billion airport project and pursuing aggressive social spending -- or if he will pursue a more balanced approach. The latter would would provide relief for Mexican assets that sold off in recent months.
“The bias will be for the peso to move back toward 21 per dollar,” said Alvise Marino, a strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York, adding that his forecast assumes the global backdrop will remain unsupportive for emerging markets. He says the market response will be “less comfortable” if his Morena party and its allies win a majority in the congress.
Lopez Obrador’s coalition looks poised to control both houses of Congress, according to one projection. With half the votes counted, he’s on track to win more than three-fifths of seats in the lower house and 70 of 128 in the Senate, though final tallies in some of those races could still be days away.
Investors in Mexico should remain wary, as risks abound, Esteban Polidura, a multi-asset strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a note.
“Our medium-term outlook remains cautious,” Polidura said. “Most of AMLO’s potential cabinet members have limited public sector experience and might have a longer-than-usual learning curve that could weigh on economic growth.”
For now, traders see either a strong selloff or quick rebound as unlikely. Stocks stumbled in the second quarter and the peso dropped as polls showed Lopez Obrador was bound for victory, so his election has already been priced in. While optimists have suggested that the next president’s actual policymaking won’t be as radical as his speeches, in which he often rails against the abuses of capitalism, it’s all conjecture until he actually takes office.
The main areas of concern are Lopez Obrador’s pledges to boost social spending, whether he will seek to foster foreign investment in the energy industry and his stance toward trade with the U.S. Some investors fear that energy privatization will be rolled back and spending to help the poor will push the country into debt.
Mexican assets fell Monday as emerging markets slid. The peso declined 0.7 percent to 20.0567 per dollar, while the Mexbol equity index sank 1.8 percent.
""During the transition period, financial markets might become unusually volatile and skittish,"" Jaime Reusche, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service wrote in a note. A key risk is the chance that ""uncertainty surrounding the incoming administration’s economic policy agenda will undermine business sentiment, hurting investment and growth prospects.""
In a victory speech following the vote, the 64-year-old struck a unifying tone while saying his government will give preference to the poor. Carlos Urzua, who was picked for finance minister, said the new administration will be fiscally responsible and will respect the autonomy of the central bank and allow the peso to trade freely.
“The early indications from AMLO are fairly encouraging,” London-based Capital Economics economist Edward Glossop wrote in a report. “Beyond the very near term, though, it’s worth cautioning that we still have little clarity on AMLO’s economic policies.""
Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE, wrote in a column that investors were right to respond relatively calmly -- but they shouldn’t become complacent.
Mexican assets “will remain sensitive to uncertainties about its trading relations with the U.S., to the receding of global liquidity, and to the limited effectiveness of multilateral institutions in influencing economic policy,” El-Erian wrote.
For some, the relief of having the election completed and a calm market reaction are enough to create a buying opportunity. Bulltick is recommending investors go long on the peso at 20 per dollar.
Others are in wait-and-see mode.
“AMLO has had statements that run the gamut from pragmatic to incendiary, so it will be interesting to see which facet of his personality prevails when in power,” said Dirk Schnitker, the head of Latin American equity sales at Auerbach Grayson.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Monday after a choppy session, with gains in Apple and other technology stocks offsetting worries about an escalating trade war between Washington and its trading partners. 
Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) each rose 1 percent or more, pushing the S&P 500 information technology index (SPLRCT) up 0.99 percent, bringing gains for the year-to-date to 11 percent as investors bet on strong earnings from Silicon Valley in the approaching quarterly reporting season.
""It doesn't look like tech is going to slow down this year,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""The tech play is here to say.""
Traders were also eyeing the July 6 deadline for U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods to kick in, which pose the danger of a strong response from Beijing.
The European Union has warned the United States that imposing import tariffs on cars and car parts would likely lead to counter-measures on $294 billion of U.S. exports, while Canada has vowed to take punitive measures in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
""These tit-for-tat trade tariffs will ultimately raise prices for consumers and will likely dampen demand for products,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. 
Ablin said he expected strong U.S. corporate earnings for the quarter ended in June, but that profits for the rest of 2018 were in danger of being hurt by an escalating trade war.
Only three of the 11 main S&P 500 sectors ended lower on Monday, with energy (SPNY) down 1.55 percent on the back of a 2 percent drop in Brent crude (LCOc1).
Wall Street suffered steep losses at the start of the session, but reversed course later.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.15 percent to end at 24,307.18 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.31 percent to 2,726.71. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.76 percent to 7,567.69.
On Tuesday, U.S. stock exchanges will close at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, when the exchanges will also be closed. With some investors already taking time off on Monday, volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.2 billion shares, compared with the 7.3 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
Also helping the market was Commerce Department data that showed U.S. construction spending increased 0.4 percent in May, more than estimated, amid gains in investment in private and public construction projects.
The Institute for Supply Management said national factory activity surged last month, likely as steel and aluminum tariffs disrupted supply chains, resulting in factories taking longer to deliver goods.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) fell 2.3 percent after the electric car maker said it hit its target of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week. Many investors were skeptical about the financial impact of ramping up production and the quality of the cars being built. In addition, just before the market close, Tesla said its chief engineer was leaving the company.
Shares of casino companies fell as gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau rose less than expected in June.
Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN) sank 7.89 percent, while  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS) fell 6.67 percent after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the stock. MGM Resorts (N:MGM) dropped 3 percent.
Dell Technologies took a step closer to becoming a public company again with a deal to buy the tracking stock of its majority-owned VMware unit. The VMware tracking stock (N:DVMT) jumped 9 percent, while VMware (N:VMW) gained 10.24 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>","Dell moves to go public, spurns IPO","By Carl O'Donnell and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc said on Monday it would pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back shares tied to its interest in software company VMware Inc (N:VMW), returning the computer maker to the stock market without an initial public offering.
Dell said the agreement values its equity at between $61.1 billion and $70.1 billion, more than twice the value of the $24.9 billion deal that founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell and buyout firm Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013. 
The transaction will allow Dell to bypass the traditional IPO process, which would likely have involved grilling by stock market investors over Dell's $52.7 billion debt pile. 
It also means Dell will not have to raise any new money, because it will pay for the deal by issuing new shares and with a $9 billion dividend it will receive from VMware. 
Going public gives Michael Dell and Silver Lake the option to eventually sell down their stakes, even as they affirmed on Monday that they had no plans to do so. Following the deal, Michael Dell will own 47 percent to 54 percent of the combined company, while Silver Lake will own between 16 percent and 18 percent.
A new public security will give Dell currency it can use to pay for acquisitions beyond cash. The security that Dell is buying back is a so-called tracking stock tied to its 81 percent economic stake in VMware. VMware specializes in virtualisation, which allows multiple systems and applications to run at the same time on the same server, something can cut companies' IT costs. 
Dell hopes the deal will allow investors to value it more easily, because it will remove the complexity of the tracking stock, according to sources familiar with the company's thinking. 
Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC Corp (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion, because it could not pay for the deal in cash. EMC owned the majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited. 
Such a security ""tracks,"" or depends, on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company rather than the operations of a company as a whole.
Dell will exchange each share of VMware tracking stock (N:DVMT) for 1.3665 shares of its Class C common stock, or $109 per share in cash, for a total cash consideration of not more than $9 billion.
Dell said it will list its Class C shares on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of the deal that will eliminate its tracking stock. Following the deal, investors who owned the tracking stock will collectively account for between 20.8 percent and 31 percent of Dell's ownership.
The transaction represents a premium of 28.9 percent to the closing price of the tracking stock on Friday. The stock ended 9 percent higher at $92.20 on Monday. VMware shares rose 10.2 percent to $162.02.
""We believe that this development is positive for VMware shares not only because it avoids the reverse merger scenario, but also because there is the possibility of VMware being taken out by Dell in the future as a 'second step' following this transaction,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a note.
A STRING OF DEALS
Michael Dell has turned to dealmaking to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services to businesses, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security.
The strategy is in sharp contrast to that of rival HP Inc (N:HPQ), which separated in 2016 from  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (N:HPE), based on the reasoning that two technology companies focused separately on hardware and services would be more nimble.
Dell's strategy is beginning to pay off, as companies look to one-stop shops to help them manage their IT infrastructure on the cloud. Dell reported consolidated adjusted cash flow of $2.4 billion in its latest quarter, up by a third year-on-year. Its total debt has gone down by $4.6 billion since the EMC deal. 

""Dell is a very different company than it was five years or so years ago. And we're seeing tremendous momentum inside the business,"" Michael Dell told analysts on a conference call.

1. Factory Orders on Tap
Trading volumes are expected a touch lighter this week amid the July 4 Independence Day holiday but a few U.S. economic data will be closely monitored for signs of ongoing U.S. economic strength.
Factory orders for May are forecast to show a 0.1% increase, rebounding from a 0.8% decline the prior month.
U.S. markets made a positive start to the second half of year despite the threat of an increase in trade-tariff rhetoric as the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imported goods are slated to come into effect on July 6.

The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 9.228 million barrels for the week ended June 22. The Energy Information Administration reported a similar draw in crude stockpiles of 9.891 million for the same period.
Crude oil futures fell 21 cents to settle at $73.94 weighed down by a rise in output from Saudi and Russia.
3. Tesla Reversal in Focus
Tesla shares closed lower Monday despite rising more than 5% in early trade as traders questioned whether the electric automaker would be able to sustain the pace of production that saw it reach its target of producing 5,000 model 3 vehicles a week. 
Tesla said Monday it produced 5,031 Model 3 cars in the last seven days of the second quarter and reaffirmed its positive cash flow and profit outlook for the year. The company, however, delivered 40,740 vehicles delivered in the second quarter compared with the Wall Street consensus of approximately 51,000.
“There’s a big difference between making 5K Model 3 units for 1 week vs. sustaining 5K per week,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.

U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled after a non-jury trial on damages held in March. She had ruled in December that PwC was liable, without setting damages.
Colonial and Taylor Bean both failed in August 2009.
PwC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FDIC spokeswoman declined to comment.
Colonial, based in Montgomery, Alabama, had been among the 25 largest U.S. banks, while Ocala, Florida-based Taylor Bean was the nation's 12th largest mortgage lender.
The FDIC, which was Colonial's receiver, said Colonial reported owning significant stakes in mortgages, including some bought from Taylor Bean, when they had been sold to other investors or had other problems, including defaults.
It said the fraud began in 2002 when Taylor Bean began overdrawing its accounts and Colonial, at the urging of Taylor Bean Chairman Lee Farkas, began manipulating those accounts to conceal the overdrafts.
The FDIC accused PwC of negligently auditing Colonial from 2003 to 2005 and in 2008.
In Monday's decision, Rothstein found it more likely than not that PwC's negligence was the proximate cause of the FDIC's damages, and that the auditor ""is responsible for the full measure of damages resulting from its negligence.""
Farkas is serving a 30-year prison term following his 2011 conviction on 14 fraud and conspiracy charges.

The panel of bankers was formed last month as lenders, already burdened by a near-record 9.5 trillion rupees of soured loans as of last year, reported a further rise in bad loans in the quarter to March after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules.
""This is a completely bank-led resolution process and there is no immediate role for the government in this,"" minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in a late-night news conference, adding that banks can transfer bad assets to the AMC or an alternate investment fund depending on market conditions.
Goyal, who is standing in for regular Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, also said that for small and medium sized industries with loans of up to 500 million rupees, a template will be made so that bank officials can decide within 90 days of a loan going sour how to resolve them.
India's 21 state banks majority-owned by the government account for two-thirds of banking assets in the country and hold close to 90 percent of soured loans. The top banks include  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) and  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK).
The bad loans problem, driven largely by infrastructure sectors including power, has stifled banks' ability to lend to new businesses to boost growth critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election by May.
In an interview published on Monday, Modi said that he identified the problem of bad loans soon after taking office in 2014 and has been working to resolve it.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Japan's MUFG calls on Morgan Stanley expertise in wealth management drive,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) is drawing on the expertise of U.S. peer  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to help expand in the wealth management business, the head of the pair's Japanese joint venture told Reuters.
Japan's biggest bank is ""consulting with Morgan Stanley's wealth management people about various aspects including product lineup,"" Saburo Araki, chief executive officer of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co Ltd (MUMSS), said in an interview.
MUMSS is a brokerage and investment bank, a product of MUFG's $9 billion investment into Morgan Stanley at the height of a financial crisis in 2008. The Japanese bank now owns just under a quarter of its Wall Street peer.
Faced with ultra-thin profit margins in Japan's traditional lending business, MUFG has made wealth management a key growth driver, targeting clients with at least 300 million yen ($2.74 million) in assets.
It aims to increase such assets under management to 16.3 trillion yen in the year through March 2024, from 12 trillion yen in the last financial year.
MUFG hopes to replicate the success of Morgan Stanley which, under CEO James Gorman has turned wealth management into a growth pillar through reducing risk, exiting problematic fields and emphasizing steadier businesses generating reliable revenue.
""It helps us greatly that we can use their expertise and experience,"" said Araki, CEO of the joint venture since April.
Araki, previously second-in-command at MUFG's core commercial bank, also said the venture has not yet fully taken advantage of the bank's vast client base, which includes 1.2 million individuals classed as wealthy.
As such, it will step up efforts to attract commercial bank customers to higher-return products like mutual funds, he said.
SOLUTIONS
MUMSS was created by combining the Japanese investment banking operations of MUFG and Morgan Stanley in 2010. Its immediate parent, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co Ltd [MTFMS.UL], is now Japan's third-largest brokerage and investment bank in terms of net operating revenue after Nomura Holdings Inc and Daiwa Securities Group Inc.
""We are really happy to have made that investment and to have teamed up with a global investment bank,"" Araki said, referring to the $9 billion deal. ""The reason we can keep top positions in league tables is none other than Morgan Stanley.""
He said MUFG has no intention of building its own investment banking franchise that would make it unnecessary to rely on Morgan Stanley.
""It's impossible. We cannot match their global network with investors and issuers,"" Araki said.
Asked to describe their respective roles in the venture, he said, ""To put it very simply, we provide our client base and they provide solutions.""
The interview took place before the securities watchdog on Friday recommended the Financial Services Agency fine MUMSS around $2 million, citing one instance of a dealer at the brokerage manipulating the bond market.

Ryanair last year agreed to recognize unions for the first time to try to avert strikes and resolve a staffing crunch, but is struggling to reach agreements in some countries.
VC was the first union to carry out a threat to strike at Ryanair last year, although the disruption was limited. The German pilots have until the end of July to cast their votes on whether to stage further walkouts.
VC said in a statement on Monday that while Ryanair's management had signaled it could make some concessions on the structure of its labor agreements, these should not lead to an increase in staff costs.
""That is in essence a clear rejection for VC. That will not allow for a reduction of the pressure on pilots by adding more staff nor for an increase in wages. We do not need a collective agreement just to keep the status quo,"" VC negotiator Ingolf Schumacher said.
Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.
The airline, which operates in 37 countries and last year carried 130 million passengers, has reached pilot union recognition agreements in Britain and Italy, but talks have stuttered in Spain and Ireland, two of its biggest markets.

A vote by pilots in Ireland on whether to take industrial action is due to end on Tuesday.

878,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",GM WARNS: Trump's tariffs 'undermine our ability to compete'," General Motors fell as much as 2% Friday after warning that US tariffs on imported vehicles, currently being considered by The White House, could ""undermine"" its ability to compete globally. 
In a filing with the US Commerce Department, the country's largest automaker said any new taxes could lead to a shrinking of the company and increased costs for consumers
""Increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less — not more — U.S. jobs,"" the company said.
""The threat of steep tariffs on vehicle and auto component imports risks undermining GM’s competitiveness against foreign auto producers by erecting broad brush trade barriers that increase our global costs, remove a key means of competing with manufacturers in lower - wage countries, and promote a trade environment in which we could be retaliated against in other markets.""
Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said earlier this week that new tariffs imposed by Europe on certain manufactured goods  will cause a ""tremendous cost increase"" that the company will have to shoulder. It also said it would seek to move manufacturing of European-bound bikes outside of the US. 
The  new EU tariffs came in retaliation to  US taxes on imported steel and aluminum, enacted earlier this year.  China has also responded by taxing imports from the US. Experts have warned that an all-out trade war  could kill hundreds of thousands of American jobs while increasing the prices consumers pay for goods across the board.
Roughly 2,500 public comments had been received by the Commerce Department ahead of the Friday deadline, the agency said in an email to Business Insider, those comments will help the agency make an ""informed recommendation"" to the President regarding new tariffs. 
Still, GM's tone is dire about outcomes if new taxes are enacted. 
""Combined with the other trade actions currently being pursued by the U.S. Government—namely the 232 Steel and Aluminum tariffs and the Section 301 tariffs against Chinese imports—the threat of additional tariffs on automobile imports could be detrimental to our company,"" GM said. ""At some point, this tariff impact will be felt by customers.""

879,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",Tesla spikes after hitting Model 3 production goal hours after self-imposed deadline," Tesla spiked as much as 6% in early trading Monday after the electric-car maker reached its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week, just hours after its self-imposed deadline. 
The production milestone was hit at around 5 a.m. local time on July 1,  Reuters reported. Tesla confirmed the milestone in a  regulatory filing Monday morning, which said it built 5,031 Model 3's in the last week of the quarter, though skeptics warn the burst of production in a  giant tent next to Tesla's Fremont, California assembly plant may not be sustainable.
""7000 cars, 7 days,"" Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric automaker said on Twitter to mark the Model 3 milestone as well as its other goal of 7,000 Model S and X cars. ""<3 Tesla Team <3.""
He also announced the news to employees in an email,  which Bloomberg published in its entirety. 
Workers had been alternating two, 12-hour shifts per day to ramp up production, according to recent reports. The company even built a massive tent structure outside its main assembly line, building a supplementary line completely from salvaged parts, Musk said.
The Model 3 — heralded as Tesla's first ""mass market"" car — has plagued the company since its launch. Tesla has struggled to meet its self-imposed goal of producing 5,000 of the vehicles per week since the beginning of the year. Amid a cash crunch, Tesla has focused on Model 3 options with sticker prices in the $65,000+ range, as opposed to the more affordable $35,000 base model, which it has yet to begin building.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst David Tamberrino  warned in June that Tesla would likely miss its Model 3 targets, echoing the  skepticism of many of his peers. Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg have an average price target of $314 for the stock, which is currently trading near $359 a share. 
Musk has acknowledged the production struggles on Twitter, where he discussed sleeping at the factory while also blasting out photos of the tented assembly line, as well as armies of seats and other car supplies destined for Tesla cars.
Monday's stock surge also makes true on Musk's recent warning of the ""short burn of the century,"" another show of his  disdain for short sellers, or those investors betting against Tesla's stock price.
""We did it!!"" Musk said in his email to Tesla employees Sunday evening,  obtained by Bloomberg. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team. Couldn’t be more proud to work with you. It is an honor.""
He continued: ""The level of dedication and creativity was mind-blowing. We either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible. Intense in tents. Transporting entire production lines across the world in massive cargo planes. Whatever. It worked. Not only did we factory gate over 5000 Model 3’s, but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7000 vehicle week!"""

At 9:33AM ET (13:33GMT), the Dow Jones fell 188 points, or 0.77%, the S&P 500 lost 19 points, or 0.68%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 60 points, or 0.77%.
The European Union has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to impose levies on imported vehicles, telling the U.S. Commerce Department that tariffs on cars and car parts were unjustifiable and did not make economic sense.
The EU warned that the U.S. tariffs would actually hurt the American economy by imposing higher costs on U.S. manufacturers and said a 25% tariff would have an initial $13 to $14 billion negative impact on U.S. gross domestic product.
In addition to that negative impact, the EU further warned that it would likely lead to counter-measures by its trading partners on $294 billion of U.S. exports.
Trump said last week that the government was completing its study and suggested the U.S. would take action soon.
The latest European retaliatory threat came as the U.S. prepares to impose $34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports on Friday. Beijing is expected to respond tit-for-tat.
Additionally, Canadian tariffs on about $13 billion worth of American goods went into effect on Sunday in a response to Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum.
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declared that Trump would not change his mind on trade policies even if the stock market continued to decline.
“You can't deal with day-to-day stock market fluctuations,"" he said, adding that the focus needed to be on what's fundamentally good for the economy.
Outside of trade tensions, investors will keep an eye on Monday’s economic data. The ISM's manufacturing survey for June, as well as a report on construction spending for May will both be released at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
While waiting for the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, gained 0.65% at 94.84 by 9:34AM ET (13:34GMT). The dollar got a boost from weakness seen in the euro after Germany's interior minister offered to resign amid an escalating row over immigration policy, throwing into doubt the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government.
In company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw shares jump 5.8% on Monday after it reported a 55% increase in production to 53,339 vehicles during the second quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) faces greater pressure to speed up change after activist investor Third Point stepped up its criticism of the world's largest food company.
The New York-based hedge fund sent a letter to Nestle's board and published a presentation online on Sunday calling for more urgent action and recommending steps it says could result in Nestle doubling its earnings per share by 2022.
The letter and presentation, published on a new Third Point website, come a year after the firm, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, took a roughly $3 billion stake in the maker of KitKat bars and Perrier water.
Nestle responded on Monday afternoon, saying it was implementing an ""accelerated long-term value creation strategy"" and was delivering results.
The Swiss company also declined to comment on a newspaper report that it was in talks to buy control of pet food maker Champion Petfoods for $2 billion.
The back-and-forth had little immediate impact on Nestle shares, which were up 0.2 percent at 1250 GMT, outperforming the broader European stock market, which was down 0.7 percent. 
Analysts said they shared many of Loeb's concerns about Nestle and agreed with some of his prescriptions.
His ideas include Nestle selling its 23 percent stake in L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and using the proceeds for M&A or share buybacks; reorganizing into three internal units; and divesting businesses that make up to 15 percent of sales. 
They questioned, however, whether the New York investor's confrontational style would win points with one of Europe's biggest companies, with a reputation for conservatism.
""While we think that in aggregate Third Point's proposals make sense, and are probably helpful from a share price perspective, we're not convinced that much is going to change as a result,"" said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, citing what they called ""practical obstacles"". 
They cited the fact Nestle has a relatively new CEO, Mark Schneider, and his need to keep its workforce motivated; Third Point's modest stake of only 1.3 percent; and Nestle's long-term approach to business.
VALUE INVESTORS
Thomson Reuters data show that just over 11 percent of Nestle shares are owned by ""value"" investors, who typically target companies they perceive to be unfairly undervalued by the broader market. They often work behind closed doors with a readiness to hold their positions for a long time.
Third Point said Nestle should be able to reach a 20 percent profit margin by 2022, up from 16.5 percent in 2017.
Nestle announced a margin target last year of 17.5 to 18.5 percent by 2020 after Loeb's first letter.
Loeb said Nestle should be able to double its earnings to 7 Swiss francs per share by 2022, up from 3.55 francs in 2017. 
""We share much of the analysis but question whether the confrontational style is likely to secure the change that Third Point is seeking,"" wrote Jefferies analysts in a note. 
They pointed out that since Schneider took the corner office 18 months ago, after joining from German healthcare company Fresenius (DE:FMEG), Nestle has taken steps which are radical for the company.
Besides recruiting its first external CEO in nearly a century, Nestle set its first margin target; set a goal to buy and divest brands accounting for as much as 10 percent of sales; signaled possible flexibility on the L'Oreal stake by not renewing a shareholders agreement; and brought on new board members with relevant external expertise.
Loeb argues Nestle should divest as much as 15 percent of sales either through sales, spin-offs or other methods to help align its business with higher-growth categories.
Nestle has recently sold its struggling U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero and agreed to take control of selling Starbucks (O:SBUX) packaged coffees around the world.
It has also invested in small, faster-growing brands including Freshly, Sweet Earth, Blue Bottle Coffee and Chameleon Cold-Brew. 

Still, the company's shares are down 6 percent from the day before Loeb revealed his stake in June 2017, as food companies continue to struggle against increased competition from start-up brands seen as healthier or more authentic.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>",Solar trade row with China forces REC Silicon to cut U.S. jobs,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's REC Silicon (OL:REC), a supplier of silicon materials to the solar industry, will cut around 100 U.S. jobs and take further asset impairments due to a U.S.-China trade war over solar panels, it said on Monday. 
The company has been unable to sell its goods in China since 2014 as a result of the dispute between the world's two largest economies, leading to several rounds of redundancies at its two U.S. plants.
The Oslo-listed firm said on Monday it would lay off around 40 percent of the 250 employees at its Moses Lake plant in the U.S. state of Washington and cut production there to about 25 percent of capacity.
Its shares were down 14 percent at 1115 GMT, lagging an Oslo benchmark index (OSEBX) down 0.5 percent, having already fallen 68 percent over the past five years. 
China has imposed tariffs on U.S. imports of polysilicon, a key element to make solar panels that REC Silicon produces, while the United States slapped tariffs on solar panel imports starting in 2012 and with a latest round in January. 
The company has another U.S. plant in Montana, which is unaffected by the latest job cuts. Some 70 workers at that plant were laid off in September and 70 were laid off at the Moses Lake plant in 2016.
""It is really sad. We can't access the market. We don't want subsidies. We just want fair access,"" CEO Tore Torvund told a conference call.
REC Silicon also said it expected to report additional impairments when it publishes second-quarter results on July 19. Second-quarter revenue was expected at $58 million, it said, adding it had about $42 million in cash. 
""Current market conditions will negatively impact the company's profitability and credit risk exposure,"" it said. REC Silicon did not say how much the impairments would be.
""We make a strong demand to the present (U.S.) administration to find a solution so that we can continue to operate out of the U.S.,"" said Torvund, reiterating calls the firm made in January, after Washington introduced 30-percent tariffs on imports of solar panels.

""We are very dependent on the U.S. administration going to the administration in China so that we can continue to operate polysilicon out of the United States,"" he said, adding the company was cost-competitive because it held technology others did not have.

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 157 points, or 0.65%, by 6:49AM ET (10:49GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 15 points, or 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 50 points, or 0.50%.
The European Union has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to impose levies on imported vehicles, telling the U.S. Commerce Department that tariffs on cars and car parts were unjustifiable and did not make economic sense.
The EU warned that the U.S. tariffs would actually hurt the American economy by imposing higher costs on U.S. manufactures and said a 25% tariff would have an initial $13 to $14 billion negative impact on U.S. gross domestic product.
In addition to that negative impact, the EU further warned that it would likely lead to counter-measures by its trading partners on $294 billion of U.S. exports.
Trump said last week that the government was completing its study and suggested the U.S. would take action soon.
The latest European retaliatory threat came as the U.S. prepares to impose $34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports on Friday. Beijing is expected to respond tit-for-tat.
Additionally, Canadian tariffs on about $13 billion worth of American goods went into effect on Sunday in a response to Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Outside of trade tensions, investors will keep an eye on Monday’s economic data. The ISM's manufacturing survey for June, as well as a report on construction spending for May will both be released at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
While waiting for the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.31% to trade at 94.52 by 6:50AM ET (10:50GMT). The dollar got a boost from weakness seen in the euro after Germany's interior minister offered to resign amid an escalating row over immigration policy, throwing into doubt the future of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government.
In company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw shares jump 6% in pre-market trade on Monday after a report that the company had met a production goal of producing 5,000 Tesla Model 3 vehicles in a week.

Neovia is majority owned by French cooperative group Invivo. Investment group Eurazeo (PA:EURA) also has a 17 percent stake in the company.
ADM and its rivals such as  Bunge  (N:BG), Cargill (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Company [AKIRAU.UL] have been forced to review their approach in recent years as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing, and selling soy, corn and wheat.
Chicago-based ADM had said in March it was shifting its business segments into four new units - carbohydrate solutions, nutrition, oilseeds and origination - to differentiate its offerings to customers.
""We were happy with our animal feed activities but it was too local, mainly based in North America and with a little in Mexico and China. We decided that if we wanted to expand we needed a more global approach,"" ADM President Europe, Middle East and Africa Pierre-Christophe Duprat told Reuters.
""The opportunity came with Neovia. There are not many actors on the market and...their product and geographical mix suited us.""
Invivo is France's largest cooperative group, gathering 206 cooperatives and 300,000 farmers, and employing 10,200 people in 34 countries. Sales stood at 5.5 billion euros in 2016/17.
Of this, Neovia had sales of 1.7 billion in 2017 and employs 8,200 staff.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 05:34AM ET</span>",Goldman to review bookbuilding after Australia regulator blasts block trade,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has agreed to review how it sells shares to investors in Australia, after the country's corporate regulator penalized its local arm for failing to notify the market about dwindling interest in a block trade it conducted in 2015.
This is the second enforcement action in Australia against a global investment bank in a month. In early June, the country's antitrust watchdog filed ""criminal cartel"" charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) over another troubled stock issue.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said Goldman Sachs Australia may not have complied with its legal obligations to ensure it operates ""efficiently, honestly and fairly"" when it failed to tell investors that interest for the A$853 million ($628.66 million) block trade in shares of  Healthscope  Ltd (AX:HSO) had waned.
The shares of the health operator were owned by TPG Capital Management LP and  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), the private equity giants which sold down Healthscope in an IPO in 2014.
""As the block trade progressed, the level of expected demand ... was not materializing as strongly as had been anticipated,"" a court document signed on Monday by ASIC representatives and heads of GS Australia showed.
""Some GS Australia representatives who were unaware that the demand was not materializing as expected continued to make statements"", suggesting the bank had five main investors who were prepared to buy A$500 million of stock, the document added.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened lower on Monday as worries about U.S. trade policies and concerns about German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government weighed on sentiment.
Economic data also failed to reassure investors with euro zone factory growth slowing to an 18-month low in June amid widespread concerns about new trade barriers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down about 0.8 percent by 0830 GMT with losses across the continent and sectors. 
""As has become the pattern of late, the markets sank on Monday morning following the latest weekend tariff talk from (U.S. President) Donald Trump, presumably to leave investors scrabbling about for any signs of trade war-avoidance across the rest of the week,"" commented Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
The European Union has warned the United States that imposing import tariffs on cars and car parts would harm its own automotive industry and likely lead to counter-measures. 
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) was down 0.6 percent. Merkel is to make a last-ditch effort to end a migration row with her conservative CSU allies by holding talks with her interior minister, whose offer to resign cast doubt over whether her fragile government can survive.
""The risk that the CSU may walk out of the government in Berlin, turning Merkel into the leader of a minority government, remains serious"", said Holger Schmieding from Berenberg.

French supermarket retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and British peer  Tesco  (L:TSCO) lost 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively after they announced plans to form a global long-term purchasing alliance, as they seek to cut costs. 
""An entente cordiale between the two giants of British and French retailing is yet another sign that squeezing the cost base is the biggest priority for supermarkets as they seek to contain the discounters and protect margins"", said Neil Wilson chief market analyst at Markets.com.
In London, the FTSE 100 was down 0.9 percent as tensions over Brexit continue within Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet and a new poll showed a record 75 percent of major British companies were now pessimistic about leaving the EU.
British gambling technology company Playtech (L:PTEC) posted the worst performance, losing over 20 percent after it disappointed investors with a trading update.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co Ltd had been co-lead manager for a total of 130 billion yen ($1.17 billion) worth of bond issuances by Toray Industries Inc (T:3402) and KDDI Corp (T:9433). It was also managing the issuance of around 30 billion yen worth of bonds for Tokyo Gas Co (T:9531).
A person with direct knowledge of one of the issuances said liaison banks on Monday told potential investors that the brokerage was no longer involved with the issuance following a reprimand by Japan's securities regulator, DealWatch reported.
A spokesman at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley said the brokerage had no comment on clients' actions.
""We accept client decisions and will make every effort to regain trust,"" the spokesman said.
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission on Friday recommended the Financial Services Agency fine the brokerage around $2 million, saying one of its dealers placed both buy and sell orders in August for a 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract without intention to execute.
The dealer aimed to create the impression of strong interest for the contract and the brokerage gained 1.58 million yen from related transactions, the watchdog said.
The Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley spokesman said the brokerage acknowledged the findings.
Toray, KDDI and Tokyo Gas told Reuters Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley was no longer managing their bond issuances. They declined to comment on reasons.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 04:48AM ET</span>",Investors seek cover as trade battles rattle world markets,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have sharply increased their use of hedging strategies, signaling concerns that the intensifying trade battle between the United States and China might hit economies from Germany to South Korea.
Money managers say that mounting barriers to trade between the United States and trading partners -- Washington's latest proposal for tariffs on $675 billion of Chinese goods is expected to elicit a response from Beijing -- is prompting them to look for ways to protect profits in the event equity markets take a dive after years of growth.
That includes bets against declines in equity indexes and currencies as well as dividends and bonds.
""Only now have trade war concerns grabbed the spotlight for investors after bubbling away in the background for most of this year, prompting the rush for such hedging trades,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, London-based chief investment officer for Europe Middle East and Africa at Russell Investments, which has nearly $300 billion of assets under management.
Trade isn't the only issue weighing on investors' minds. European growth has lost steam, oil prices are near $80 a barrel while the U.S., European and many emerging central banks are tightening monetary policy.
And politics could exacerbate any downturn, with Germany's coalition in uproar over migration, and Italy's new government flirting with a big-spending, possibly eurosceptic, agenda. 
Hedging strategies also carry risk, however, namely that an anticipated market fall does not materialize.
Despite rising concerns among investors, the world economy is on a strong footing, with the global economy expected to grow 3.9 percent this year and next, according to the International Monetary Fund.
While many investors are reducing their exposure to equities, most remain reluctant to completely move away from stocks. As a result, demand has risen for investment positions aimed at offsetting potential losses, according to money managers, market indicators and data.
That includes trades such as ""put"" options on certain indexes - allowing them to sell at a preset price if the index falls below a certain level in exchange for paying a premium - or short selling the bonds of highly indebted companies.
Short selling is when hedge funds and other investors borrow securities and sell them, betting the price will fall so they can buy them back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Investors also appear to be seeking more options market protection against currency losses, especially on trade-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar or the Chinese yuan, via purchasing put options on these currencies in the $5.1 trillion a day foreign exchange markets.
""Some of these trades are an extension to what we have been seeing from earlier this year but there is no doubt that there is increased nervousness now reflected in markets,"" said Eugene Philalithis, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International, which manages $2.4 trillion assets under management globally.
""CRASH INSURANCE""
Shifts in the costs of derivatives indicate hedging demand has picked up since trade concerns intensified.
For instance, the cost of hedging against falls in Germany's DAX index (GDAXI), highly exposed to exports to the United States and China, has increased sharply in the past week, according to Mathilde Richardot, a derivatives strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) based in London.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Volatility Index skew - a measure that derivatives markets look at to gauge demand for protection against volatility spikes - hit an all-time high as investors bought protection against sharp drops in equity prices for July and August. Similar moves were seen in U.S. stocks. (SKEWX)
Some market specialists say out-of-the-money put options are increasingly popular; they are typically cheaper and provide protection in the event of larger price drops.
Investors have also purchased options that hedge against a drop of 10 percent or more in U.S. indexes, according to UBS strategists.
Open interest - or the value of such options outstanding and a gauge of demand from investors - on put options on the S&P 500 index (SPX) falling around 10 percent from current levels maturing in the next two weeks is far greater than on other options, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Such is the demand for such ""crash insurance"" that James Purcell, head of alternative and sustainable investments at UBS Global Wealth Management said they are advising clients to look at other markets such as Hong Kong and South Korea to hedge equity market downside risks.
Edmund Shing, head of global equity derivatives at BNP Paribas says ""the whole point of insurance is you should buy it if it's cheap.""
Such trades are attractively priced because volatility, despite the souring environment, remains low, a phenomenon some put down to central bank liquidity supporting asset prices. 
A gauge of expected S&P500 volatility is half the level of highs hit in February (VIX).

Interest by investors in dividend hedging is also on the rise. While bumper shareholder payouts alongside buybacks have driven much of the equity bonanza in recent years, logic dictates that any glitch in the corporate cycle will cause dividends to be cut.
Investors often buy dividend futures, or contracts that allow them to bet on companies' future payouts.
But ""puts"" on Eurostoxx 50 dividend futures are drawing more interest, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and BNP Paribas, banks that dominate Europe's equity derivatives business.
When the global economy is doing well, companies are comfortable paying out dividends to their investors but at the first sign of market stress, companies want to conserve precious cash flow so ""dividends suffer a lot more,"" said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation strategy at Societe Generale.
Once the preserve of hedge funds, mainstream asset managers and pension funds increasingly use dividend futures, he added.
The Euro Stoxx 50 dividend futures index (SX5EDFT), which aggregates dividend futures contracts, is down 2.1 percent year-to-date, after six consecutive years of gains, suggesting investors expect dividends to decline.
Away from derivatives, outright short interest in emerging market equities has picked up on concerns that this sector would be worst hit should a trade war break out. Short interest measures the number of short positions not yet closed out.
Short bets in emerging market equities scaled a post-crisis high of $110 billion in early June, with China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand among the most shorted markets, according to data from IHS Markit.
BOND MARKETS
Bond markets have not been spared. Investors have built a notional $55 billion of short positions in U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate debt, according to IHS Markit. Short positions are up $8 billion this year and rose more than $2.3 billion since the end of April, IHS Markit data shows.
High-grade bonds have performed poorly this year; this and the short bets are down to companies' high debt levels -- almost all U.S. sectors' leverage ratios were above their 20-year average as of end-2017, Societe Generale estimates.
This makes companies vulnerable to rising borrowing costs as well as higher tariffs.

A trade war would darken the overall outlook but some currencies, including the Australian dollar or from emerging markets, are expected to suffer more than others.
Investors went long the dollar the week of June 18 against emerging currencies for the first time in eight months . Australia's dollar  is near 1-1/2 year lows as the country boasts China as its biggest trading partner.
Derivative markets suggest investors are increasingly risk averse.
Three-month risk reversals on the Australian dollar , a ratio of calls to puts, is near 2018 lows. A similar gauge on the Swiss franc , a perceived safe-haven in the currency markets, indicates bullish positions on the franc at near two-month highs.

900,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>","BMW, Ford and Tesla Brace for ‘Nightmare’ Tariff Whiplash","(Bloomberg) -- For BMW AG, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and other global automakers whose future is ever-more dependent on China’s burgeoning market, any gains from lower import tariffs this week will likely be short-lived -- thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war.
After decades of pleading for easier access to the world’s biggest car market, manufacturers finally saw duties on overseas imports almost halved to 15 percent on Sunday. But the reprieve for producers of those models -- if they are built in the U.S. -- is set to end in five days, when a retaliatory 25 percent levy makes them more expensive.
Trump’s tit-for-tat trade squabble with China threatens to undo years of lobbying by carmakers and drag Europe’s leading luxury brands into the fray because of decisions that were made when global manufacturing and exporting were buzzwords. Now, the uncertain implications of a tariff whiplash are unnerving dealers and consumers in a country where a record 24 million vehicles were sold last year.
“It is a nightmare to have the 25 percent additional duty,” said Wang Rongzhen, deputy general manager and an investor in Yan’an Jinchi Feike Auto Sales and Service Co. The Yan’an, Shaanxi-based dealership imports models such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Jeep from the U.S.
At Shanghai Aote Hung Car Sales, higher tariffs would just be another headache for sales manager Liu Yuanyuan, who says she’s struggling to shift stock as consumers anticipate the typical summer clearance discounts. Her dealership imports models including those from Mercedes Benz, Buick and Jaguar Land Rover.
""Most of the clients are waiting,"" Liu said. ""After the trade war issue, many imported vehicles like Mercedes-Benz or BMW, especially the BMW X4, X5 and X6 manufactured in U.S. are being impacted. We are advertising that clients can buy cars at promised prices before July 6, but there are no guarantees afterward.""
Unless President Trump backs down, on July 6 the U.S. will impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, many of them parts used in products such as marine engines and power turbines. China will impose countervailing levies the same day -- including on U.S.-manufactured cars. The auto tariffs will wipe out the July 1 reduction to 15 percent from 25 percent on all foreign car imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs couldn’t have come at a worse time for foreign luxury-car makers. The depreciating yuan is already making imported vehicles more expensive for local buyers. Chinese equities have entered a bear market, further eroding domestic buying power.
“U.S. carmakers may need to brace for seeing their market share encroached as consumers increasingly favor domestic brands,” said Liu Yuanchun, a professor at the National Academy of Development and Strategy at Beijing-based Renmin University of China.
The additional levies could trigger even more retaliatory measures. Trump last month instructed trade officials to identify $200 billion in Chinese imports for additional tariffs of 10 percent, and said the U.S. would impose duties on another $200 billion if Beijing retaliates. China vowed to hit back.
Amid the rising tensions, carmakers across the world are urging Trump’s administration not to impose tariffs of its own on overseas car imports. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. said duties would be “devastating.” General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., which imports vehicles from Mexico to sell in the U.S., warned it might shrink U.S. operations and cut jobs.
Of China’s $51 billion of vehicle imports in 2017, about $13.5 billion came from North America, including sales of models made there by non-U.S. manufacturers like BMW. China imported 280,208 vehicles, or 10 percent of total imported cars, from the U.S. last year, according to China’s Passenger Car Association.
Some U.S. automakers that preemptively lowered prices in China are now cornered. A day after China announced cutting auto-import tariffs in May, Tesla lowered prices by about 6 percent. That means the Model S sedan would cost between 710,000 yuan ($107,000) and 1.23 million yuan.
Andy Wu, who works at a trading company in Beijing, has been looking at buying a Tesla but now has second thoughts even after the recent discounts.
""I want to choose some accessories and customize some parts, and they don’t really have a vehicle the way I wanted that’s already cleared customs before the new tariff gets in,” said the 33-year-old. “I’m going to wait for a while and see where this is going.""
""Why would I pay 25 percent more but not get an upgrade in quality or a fancier brand?"" Wu said. ""If it’s bumped up to over 800,000 yuan, why not buy a Porsche?”
Wang, the manager at Jinchi Feike, said carmakers may be reluctant to reverse the price cuts after July 6 because they will find it more difficult to compete with European brands.
Even U.S. automakers that assemble vehicles in China, such as GM and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., could be hurt by the July 6 tariff out of concern their cars will become more expensive to repair, he said.
Ford said that it’s ""essential that governments work together to lower, not raise, barriers to trade"" and that it will maintain price cuts on imported Ford and Lincoln models announced in May. BMW said its business model relies on global free trade. The German luxury-car maker expects ""stronger"" sales momentum in the second half of the year, with the launch of locally produced X3 model. GM said it ""has the philosophy to build where we sell. Virtually all the vehicles we sell in China are built in China, and virtually all parts are sourced locally.""
Tesla and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment. Mercedes-Benz’s owner  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
Among foreign carmakers, Tesla is particularly vulnerable to an increase in Chinese tariffs. Unlike GM, Ford, BMW and Daimler, the Palo Alto, California-based company has no manufacturing plant in China. Tesla has been working with Shanghai’s government since last year to explore assembling cars in China, but has yet to reach a definitive agreement.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 04:26AM ET</span>",China completes trial of 21 over scandal-hit Fanya exchange,"By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A court in China's southwestern city of Kunming has completed a two-day trial of officials connected with the scandal-hit Fanya Nonferrous Metals Exchange, which collapsed in 2015 owing investors more than 40 billion yuan ($6.03 billion).
State news agency Xinhua ended two years of official silence on Sunday, saying Fanya's chairman, Shan Jiuliang, was among 21 suspects who faced charges of embezzlement and the illegal use of bank deposits at the trial, held on the weekend.
The indictment also accused the defendants of violating national financial management laws and regulations, and of causing ""major economic losses"". A verdict will be delivered later, Xinhua said, without elaborating.
""I don't expect the verdict to come soon, because there should be many more lawsuits,"" said an investor based in Shanghai, who said he lost millions of yuan in the scheme. 
The trial was held amid tight security, with some investors even ordered by police to leave Kunming before it began.
With police restricting access by both vehicles and pedestrians, conditions around the court building on Sunday resembled ""a state of martial law"", one investor told Reuters.
The investor, who declined to be identified because of the risk of repercussions, said that despite promises by the local government, none of the alleged victims were permitted to attend the trial. 
Investors were given only three days in which to submit applications to attend, but were unable to get through the cordon around the building, the Shanghai-based investor said. 
The Fanya exchange was launched in 2011, embarking on what it called a state-backed mission to stockpile 14 rare metals, including indium, to win greater Chinese control of global prices. It offered annual returns of 13.68 percent to those investing in a financial product it offered.
But it started freezing transactions and accounts in April 2015, amid ""liquidity"" problems, prompting protests outside the exchange in Kunming and at the offices of China's financial regulators in Beijing and Shanghai, with investors accusing Shan of running a Ponzi scheme.
Reuters was unable to reach Shan or his legal representatives on Monday to seek comment. 
Shan was arrested in 2016, after giving investigators the names of 400 companies and individuals he said had borrowed from Fanya funds. Kunming police later confirmed ""illegal activities"" had taken place at the exchange and investigations were underway.
""The local Yunnan government supported the growth of Fanya into what was the world's biggest nonferrous metals exchange until it collapsed,"" said the Shanghai-based investor, who also declined to be named because of the fear of repercussion.
""What we really want to voice out loud is the role played by the local government, which should also be on trial.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks on Monday handed back their gains from a bounce late last week as worries mount ahead of a U.S. move to impose $34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports.
The yuan , fresh off its worst month on record, continued to lose ground against the dollar, trading at around 6.6450 at 0606 GMT from a close of 6.6225 on Friday.
Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September  were down in the morning but reversed course in the afternoon, inching up about 0.1 percent.
After rising last week to a more than one-year high on trade war fears, the cost to insure exposure to Chinese debt fell on Monday. The spread of the five-year credit default swap rate on Chinese sovereign debt  fell 4.7 percent to 69.79 basis points.
Markets are jittery ahead of a July 6 deadline when the United States is due to impose the tariffs on Chinese exports. Beijing is expected to respond with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods.
Even before the tariffs kick in, a private survey showed manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy slowed slightly.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) declined to 51.0 in June from May's 51.1, with a subindex showing new export orders contracting for the third straight month and the most in two years.
On Friday, Chinese stocks and the yuan bounced with benchmark share indexes having one of their best days since mid-2016.
Still, June represented the worst month for Chinese stocks in more than two years and the yuan's biggest monthly fall on record.
By 0637 GMT on Monday, the blue chip CSI300 index (CSI300) was down 3.1 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell about 2.6 percent. Financial stocks led declines, with the CSI financial sub-index <.CSI300FS> off 4 percent.
Chen Xiaopeng, an analyst with Sealand Securities, said more pessimism was on the cards for Chinese stock investors with the country's economic outlook hurt by prospects of a full-blown trade war between Beijing and Washington.
""It could take at least several months for the major stock indexes to bottom out,"" he said.
Uncertainties will reinforce investors' inclination to ""huddle together for warmth"" in outperforming sectors such as consumers and healthcare, Chen said.
An index tracking healthcare firms <.CSI300HC> is up nearly 20 percent so far this year, while the Shanghai index is down around 15 percent.
Concerns about the world's second-largest economy heightened following more signs of slowdown in the manufacturing sector. 
Hong Kong's markets were closed on Monday for a public holiday to mark the 21st anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
The yuan fell 3.25 percent against the dollar in June and continued its slide despite a firmer-than-expected midpoint set by the central bank on Monday.
""Investors don't care and spot yuan rates continued weakening,"" a trader said.
If the yuan's decline intensifies,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists wrote in a note on Monday that the Chinese central bank, the People's Bank of China, may step up intervention.
""CNY may overshoot with shifting market expectations of policy stance amid higher trade tensions, but we don't expect policymakers to encourage material RMB depreciation. The PBOC could step up intervention if depreciation risk intensifies,"" they wrote.
On Friday, the last trading day of the month, ING lowered its yuan forecast to 7 per dollar by the end of the year from a previous forecast of 6.6, citing risks to the policy outlook.
""A weaker currency would, at most, be a shield, safeguarding wider damage from a trade war and the hurdles faced by Chinese companies' operating in the U.S.,"" it said. ING added it did not see any panic in the market.
ING's shift follows a similar move on June 24 by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which said it expected the yuan to depreciate to 6.8 per dollar by the end of this year and 7.2 by the end of 2019. It had previously forecast 6.4 yuan per dollar in each year.
The depreciation will be ""driven by an important change of policy stance from tightening to loosening"", it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A renewed slide in Chinese shares and a sobering set of factory surveys sucked Asian markets lower on Monday, while the euro and the Mexican peso were both jolted by political developments at home.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) followed with a loss of 0.5 percent and European bourses were seen opening down.
Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) resumed their slide with a fall of 2.3 percent that soured sentiment across the region. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened.
Tension is growing ahead of a July 6 deadline when the U.S. is due to impose US$34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports.
""The key risk for the market isn't that Trump actually implements his trade threats but rather that a protracted period of trade uncertainty begins to weigh on economic activity,"" said analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note.
""The evidence suggesting this is happening is far from conclusive, but ominous data points are accumulating.""
Two surveys of Chinese manufacturing out in the last few days showed a softening in activity, partly due to softness in exports.
A slew of factory readings from across the globe are due on Monday, while the U.S. ISM report is out on Tuesday. Minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting come on Thursday and the week closes with U.S. payrolls for June.
A DEAL, OR NOT?
In currency markets, the euro took an early knock on reports German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had rejected a migration deal German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiated at a European Union summit on Friday.
The currency then partly bounced on news Seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party.
The move makes the future of Merkel's government even more uncertain as her Christian Democrats party (CDU) relies on the CSU to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum.
After all that, the euro was 0.33 percent easier at $0.1642 (EUR=), having skidded as far as $1.1632 at one stage.
The U.S. dollar gained 0.18 percent on a basket of currencies to 94.808 (DXY), but was still below Friday's top of 95.324. It was flat on the yen at 110.68  having been as high as 111.06 at one stage.
The Mexican peso see-sawed after leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory for president.
Dealers said the clear win might settle one source of political uncertainty, but Obrador was also expected to sharpen Mexican divisions with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
After an initial retreat, the dollar soon rebounded to be flat at 19.9050 pesos , up from last week's trough around 19.5580.
Trump also loomed large in oil markets with crude taking a spill after he tweeted that Saudi Arabia had agreed to lift oil production by ""maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels"". 
The missive was later downplayed by the White House and Saudi Press Agency.

Brent crude (LCOc1) lost 97 cents to $78.26 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 73 cents to $73.42. The pullback was still modest given U.S. crude rallied more than 8 percent last week, while Brent gained more than 5 percent.

ATR, jointly owned by Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italian company Leonardo (MI:LDOF), said one of the drivers for its bullish long-term forecast was expectations for 2,770 new routes potentially coming on board.
ATR, whose main rival is Canadian group Bombardier (TO:BBDb), added that 30 percent of regional traffic by 2037 would come from routes which do not yet exist, while the cargo market would also contribute to rising demand for turboprops.
""The key driver for this positive outlook is traffic growth in regional connectivity,"" ATR said in a statement.
""This comes from both traditional markets where less connected locations are being connected with direct regional new routes, as well as from emerging markets where the most viable solution for connecting people and transporting goods is turboprop air links,"" added the company.
ATR said the biggest demand for turboprops in the next 20 years would come from Asia, which would account for 43 percent. Europe, Africa and the Middle East would count for 31 percent of demand, while the Americas would account for 26 percent.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 01:16AM ET</span>","Halfway through, 2018 delivers little to S&P 500 investors","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Halfway through 2018, investing in Wall Street's leading S&P 500 stock index has been nothing to shout about.
The index of about 500 of the largest U.S. corporations has risen 1.7 percent year to date, far short of its 8 percent increase in the first half of 2017, even as the technology-heavy Nasdaq and Russell 2000 index of smaller companies touch record highs. 
Including dividends, the S&P 500 has returned only about 3 percent in 2018, compared with nearly 22 percent last year.
(Graphic: S&P 500 underperforms - https://reut.rs/2NbsFjB)
While newly enacted corporate tax cuts propelled a nine-year bull market higher in January, fears of an escalating trade war between the United States and China have lately become a persistent counterweight denting investor sentiment.
Investors currently favor small-cap stocks because they are seen as benefiting more than large companies from the deepest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, with some on Wall Street also betting that smaller companies may be less at risk of trade tariffs.
The Russell 2000 index is up 7 percent year to date, while the Nasdaq has surged 9 percent, buoyed by the tech sector's popularity with investors.
(Graphic: U.S.-China trade and the S&P 500 - https://reut.rs/2ICOULJ)
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 2 percent in the past six months, weighed down by double-digit declines in 3M Co, Procter & Gamble Co,  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, which in June was evicted from the group of 30 top-shelf U.S. corporations.
Market strategists polled by Reuters last month predicted on average that the S&P 500 would post an annual gain of 7 percent in 2018, more modest than the 9 percent increase they predicted in a February survey.
After the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Jan 26, the index has fallen 5 percent, with declines in banks and consumer staples more than offsetting a recovery in technology stocks including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), both up close to 10 percent in the past six months.
(Graphic: Sectors since Jan 26 market high - https://reut.rs/2KwHviJ)
Financials, which account for about 13 percent of the S&P 500, have been badly bruised by Wall Street's stumble, falling 11 percent since the index's record high.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) have each fallen 15 percent or more during that time.
Rising short-term interest rates and falling long-term rates, a combination that makes bank lending less profitable, have contributed to weakness in bank shares.
(Graphic: Financials Since Jan 26 - https://reut.rs/2IAPlGv)
While 2018 has offered scant returns for S&P 500 investors, it has provided more than its share of volatility. Twenty-nine percent of trading sessions in the first half of 2018 saw moves greater than 1 percent in either direction, compared with just 3.2 percent of trading days in all of 2017, according to a report from Bespoke Investment Group.
Optimism around the tax cuts has Wall Street expecting S&P 500 earnings per share to surge 22 percent in 2018. Those unusually high earnings projections, and the stock market's mostly lateral movement over the past five months, have made stock valuations appear more reasonable than they had late in 2018.
The S&P 500 is now trading at just over 16 times expected earnings, down from over 18 at the market's high in January, and in line with the index's five-year average valuation, according to Thomson Reuters data.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2018 12:32AM ET</span>",Nissan scraps potential $1 billion sale of battery unit to China's GSR,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Thomas Wilson
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (T:7201) has canceled a potential $1 billion sale of its electric car battery unit to China's GSR Capital, opening the door to other likely suitors keen on a component that is vital for the booming electric vehicles industry.
Japan's second-biggest automaker said the Chinese investment firm lacked the funds to make the purchase. The deal could not be closed by the June 29 deadline, Nissan said, ending a process which had faced several delays since its announcement almost a year ago.
As tightening global emissions regulations send global automakers scrambling to develop and mass produce electric cars, battery companies and auto parts makers are seeking to expand production of lithium ion batteries, a key component of these vehicles. Investors have been buying into the battery industry. 
Battery and lithium producers have represented attractive assets for Chinese firms, amid a push by Beijing to promote electric vehicles and help domestic car makers leapfrog the combustion engine to build global auto brands.
In August, Nissan had announced its plan to sell Automotive Energy Supply Corp, which includes battery plants in the United States, England and Japan, for an undisclosed sum. A source told Reuters at the time that GSR had agreed to pay Nissan a total of $1 billion for the deal. https://reut.rs/2MDIwpN
Since then, the deal has faced a series of delays, including prolonged talks between GSR Capital and NEC Corp (T:6701), which holds a 42 percent stake in the company, over the acquisition of its subsidiary NEC Energy Devices, which holds a 7 percent stake. 
Nissan, which holds a 51 percent stake, had extended the transaction deadline three times from its original December 2017 closing date.
A Nissan spokesman said that the company still intends to sell the subsidiary, but declined to comment on whether GSR could still be a prospective buyer. 
GSR declined to comment.
Previously, Panasonic Corp (T:6752) was among the companies which had been in talks with Nissan over a sale of the batteries unit, sources have told Reuters. Along with South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), the Japanese electronics firm is a key supplier of electric car batteries, producing them for Tesla (O:TSLA).
GSR, which has previously invested in clean technology and electric cars, mainly targets foreign industrial and emerging technology companies, including electric car batteries and pharmaceuticals firms.
Recently GSR has ramped up its dealmaking in Europe, agreeing in March to invest $500 million in Swedish electric car maker National Electric Vehicle Sweden and produce EV batteries in the country, and signing a deal to set up a $4.5 billion joint venture with Turkey's Zorlu Holding to build a battery assembly plant in Turkey.

Nissan shares were down 1.2 percent on Monday afternoon, in line with the broader Tokyo stock market (N225).

The tariffs would hike production costs at Hyundai's U.S. factory by about 10 percent and ""jeopardize"" its U.S. investment plan, the top South Korean automaker said, echoing sentiments of other global carmakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG).
The United States in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs.
The tariffs ""would be devastating to Hyundai Motor"", Hyundai said in comments to the U.S. Department of Commerce late on Friday, according to a post on a U.S. government website.
Hyundai also said auto trade restrictions ""would severely weaken Korea's economy and therefore its ability to advance shared U.S.-Korea security interests in the region"". 
""Although the recent summit between the leadership of the United States and North Korea has decreased tensions in the region, it is still critical for the United States and Korea to act in unison in order to resolve the nuclear issue,"" it said.
The auto sector accounted for 13 percent of total exports by South Korea, Asia's fourth-biggest economy, in 2016.
Hyundai produces in the United States almost half of its vehicles sold in the country, while affiliate Kia (KS:000270) makes in the United States about a third of its cars sold there.
Hyundai said its products are heavily focused on sedans, meaning its imports do not pose a threat to U.S. automakers that concentrate more on large SUVs and pickups. 
It also said Seoul has agreed in principle to revise a bilateral trade deal with Washington, addressing a U.S. auto trade deficit with South Korea.

""Given these outcomes, which are unique among major automotive exporting nations, Korean automobile and auto part imports cannot be a threat to the U.S. economy or national security,"" Hyundai said in the comments.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",KKR seeks to woo investors with corporate rejig,"By Joshua Franklin and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR & Co (N:KKR) transforms into a corporation on Sunday, a change that should help the U.S. private equity firm tap a new pool of investors for its stock. 
What remains to be seen is if, given the new option, active fund managers will want to buy what KKR is selling. The firm's rivals will meanwhile be keeping an eye on investor demand to judge if they should follow suit. 
The change by KKR, which made its name through leveraged buyouts in Corporate America in the 1980s, to so-called C-Corp from a publicly traded partnership (PTP) will mean a bigger tax bill. But it also opens the door to more investors, including some of the world's biggest mutual funds. 
""How many of those people will show up on July 1? I have no idea,"" said KKR head of investor relations Craig Larson, adding that the decision was made for the long-term benefit of the firm.
HITTING THE PAVEMENT 
KKR's management has held nearly 100 investor meetings since announcing the conversion in May. Speculation about new demand for the stock starting July 1 has helped boost the shares around 20 percent, far outpacing peers. 
But fund managers say lingering complexity, the unpredictable nature of private equity performance fees and the fact that they are still founder-controlled could hold some investors back. 
""We love it, but there is a lot of ambivalence in the investment community about these names,"" said Ariel Investments vice chairman Charles Bobrinskoy, a KKR and Blackstone Group (N:BX) shareholder.
That could frustrate KKR management and employees, who own a large chuck of shares that have largely been underperforming the broader market since the firm went public. 
The new structure will make KKR eligible to be included in stock indexes, a change that can boost demand from passive investors that track those benchmarks. 
KKR is also trying to make its business easier for potential new investors to understand, simplifying earnings disclosures and no longer focusing on complicated metrics like economic net income, a hypothetical number reflecting the mark-to-market valuation of portfolio gains or losses. 
Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes said the change into a C-Corp solves some of the technical aspects of owning the stock but that ""the nature of their business still comes with complexity.""
Many mutual funds are either prohibited from investing in PTPs or opt not to because of the administrative hassle. 
CONVERSION COMFORT
As public companies, private equity firms have been able to diversify and invest in areas such as real estate, infrastructure and credit to style themselves as alternative asset managers. 
But while profits have swelled, their shares have lagged. Since KKR's 2010 initial public offering through the end of 2017 the stock gained 48 percent, trailing the Dow Jones U.S. Financials Index (DJUSFN) which more than doubled in the same period. 
Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said last year that Blackstone's stock price would be more than triple what it was at the time if it were valued the same as the average S&P 500 company based on its dividend yield.
TAX TRADEOFF 
The downside is that, as a C-Corp, KKR will now be subject to the higher corporate tax rate on the performance fees it earns on the money it manages instead of the more favorable tax treatment it enjoyed as a partnership. 
The recent U.S. federal tax cut has softened the blow but in the years ahead, KKR expects its effective tax rate eventually to rise to around 23 percent from roughly 7 percent.
The bet is that the greater tax burden will be offset by the market giving a higher valuation to its earnings. 
""It will take time to have comfort around the actual impact of the conversion,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.
If the conversion does pay off for KKR, rivals Apollo Global Management (N:APO), Blackstone and  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) could follow suit. 
 Ares Management LP  (N:ARES) made a similar change earlier this year, but KKR's $20 billion market capitalization is more than four times that of Ares and provides a better test case.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 09:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Tesla hits Model 3 manufacturing milestone, hours after deadline - factory sources","By Alexandria Sage and Salvador Rodriguez
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) nearly produced 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans in the last week of its second quarter, with the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Chief Executive Elon Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters.
The 5,000th car finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory around 5 a.m. PDT (1200 GMT), one person said. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period. 
Musk said the company hit its target of 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday afternoon and seen by Reuters. Tesla also expects to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week ""next month.""
""I think we just became a real car company,"" Musk wrote. The company hit the Model 3 mark while also achieving its production goal of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week, Musk said in the email.
Tesla confirmed the contents of the email.
After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.
Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla's first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.
Production of the Model 3, which began last July, has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems from an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.
As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.
""It was pretty hectic,"" said one worker who described the atmosphere as ""all hands on deck.""
Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a ""mass celebration.""
Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed and increase efficiency to produce the cars at a profit. 
REPEATABLE?
Tesla will have to prove to investors that it can sustain and increase its production pace, and some skeptics have bet against the company.
Short sellers lost over $2 billion in June due to Tesla's rising share price and this latest achievement could buoy the company's shares at market open on Monday. 
Shares of Tesla, which closed on Friday at $342.95, are up 40 percent since a year low in April.
In recent months, the company has engaged in so-called ""burst builds,"" temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time. 
Analyst Brian Johnson of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) warned investors in March to be wary of brief ""burst rates"" of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.
One worker told Reuters that, to meet the goal, employees from other departments were dispatched to parts of the Model 3 assembly line to keep it running constantly, and breaks were staggered ""so the line didn't stop moving.""
The worker also said some areas within the factory were shut down to divert their workers to help out on the Model 3, such as the Model S line.
That suggests that Tesla was able to generally meet its production target through manual labor, rather than the automation Musk originally promised would make Tesla a competitive force in manufacturing. Earlier this year, Musk - who has described his vision for the Fremont factory as an ""alien dreadnought"" - acknowledged error in adding too much automation, too fast, to the Model 3 assembly line.
In May, Tesla sent a new battery assembly line via cargo planes to its Gigafactory battery plant outside Reno, Nevada in order to speed production, as first reported by Reuters.
When first unveiled in March 2016, the Model 3 generated thousands of reservations from consumers in an unprecedented show of support for the new vehicle. Most recently in May, Tesla said that despite the delivery delays, its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.
Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the more premium version. 
Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla's market value is close to that of General Motors Co (N:GM). 

The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 08:53PM ET</span>","Loeb pressures Nestle for more sales, restructuring","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb on Sunday stepped up pressure on food group Nestle SA (S:NESN), in a letter that urged its board to be ""sharper,"" ""bolder"" and ""faster"" in spinning off businesses and untangling its complex management structure.
""This is a call for urgency – rather than incrementalism,"" said Loeb's letter. It came with a 34-page presentation with recommendations and critiques. Third Point, the $18 billion hedge fund which has invested more than $3 billion in Nestle, also launched website http://www.nestlenow.com to push its case.
Loeb's letter, seen by Reuters, demanded that Nestle spin off more businesses that do not fit its strategy including ice cream, frozen foods, and confectionary; divide itself internally into three divisions - beverages, nutrition and grocery; and add an outsider to the board with expertise in the food and beverage business.
Each division should have its own CEO, regional structure and marketing heads, Loeb said. This would ""simplify (Nestle's) overly complex organizational structure,"" the letter said.
Nestle had no immediate comment on the letter, which was first reported by the Financial Times.
Loeb's demands came roughly on the first anniversary of his investment in Nestle and at a time of significant merger activity in the food industry. For months, the activist investor who previously pushed for change at Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) as well as other companies watched and periodically made supportive public comments about Nestle's new chief executive officer, Mark Schneider.
But his letter made clear that Third Point is no longer willing to keep its critiques behind closed doors.
It criticized Nestle's slow sales growth, declining stock price and its failure to sell off more pieces that do not fit its ""nutrition health and wellness"" strategy.
The fund manager's biggest concern was corporate structure, with the board of directors in charge of strategic direction.
""Nestle’s insular, complacent, and bureaucratic organization is overly complex, lethargic, and misses too many trends,"" Loeb said in the letter.
In early 2017, the Swiss company hired Schneider, a German, as its first non-Swiss CEO in nearly a century. He had won praise for overhauling Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG).
But former CEO Paul Bulcke remained Nestle's board chair, which raised eyebrows among governance experts. Insiders say that after months at the helm, Schneider has yet to bring in a broad team of his own.

Industry experts say CEOs sometimes privately welcome public critiques from big shareholders, as effective cover to push through changes more aggressively. Loeb has only put together websites twice before - at Yahoo and Dow Chemical, but he has been vocal at plenty of companies and most recently pushed for United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) to break itself into three companies.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Interpublic near deal to buy Acxiom marketing solutions unit for around $2.2 billion,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Acxiom Corp (O:ACXM) is nearing a deal to sell its marketing solutions division to Interpublic Group of Companies Inc (N:IPG) for around $2.2 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
The move means that Little Rock, Arkansas-based Acxiom will part ways with a business that comprises roughly three quarters of its revenue in order to double down on its fast-growing ""LiveRamp"" unit, which helps companies more easily access and manipulate data. 
The talks are advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as next week, though there is always a chance that discussions could stall at the last minute, the person added. 
After the deal closes, Acxiom will eventually explore a potential sale of its remaining business, though its board may choose to give the Acxiom some time to trade in the public markets before they run a sale process, the person said. 
Interpublic and Acxiom were not immediately available for comment. 
For New York City-based Interpublic Group, the deal will give the advertising company access to Axciom's reams of customer data, helping it better compete in an industry where clients increasingly expect advertising companies to offer data-driven insights. 
Interpublic Group is comprised of a bundle of advertising agencies including major networks such as McCann Worldgroup and FCB as well as many smaller, more specialized businesses. 
Acxiom announced it was conducting a review for the business earlier this year as part of a broader reorganization that saw its various business lines consolidated into either the LiveRamp or marketing solutions units. 
Axciom acquired LiveRamp in 2014 for around $310 million. 
The deal highlights the value for advertising companies in owning their own customer data at a time when the companies most known for gathering data on consumers, such as social media player  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), are under political pressure to be more cautious about how they collect and share data.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 10:59AM ET</span>",Tenaris lays off Canadian workers as Trump steel tariffs bite,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Steel pipe maker  Tenaris  SA (MI:TENR) is temporarily laying off workers and adjusting production at a Canadian plant because of uncertainty in the steel market following tariffs imposed by the United States, a company official said.
The first publicly disclosed job losses in the Canadian steel industry since the Trump administration's metal tariffs were disclosed in March takes effect the same day as Canada's retaliatory trade action against the United States takes hold. The job cuts were announced on Saturday.
Canada is striking back at the United States on the tariffs, slapping punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.6 billion) worth of American goods, ranging from steel products to maple syrup to orange juice, starting on Sunday. The government also unveiled an aid package of up to C$2 billion to protect steel and aluminum sectors and related industries.
Canada joins the European Union and China is taking retaliatory trade actions in response to U.S. decisions.
The escalating trade tensions between the two neighbors has driven bilateral relations to their lowest point in decades. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said Canada was profiting from U.S. trade, and launched a blistering attack on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, describing him as ""very dishonest and weak"" at the end of the Group of Seven leaders meeting in Canada earlier this month.
Representatives for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who unveiled Canada's retaliatory measures on Friday, were not immediately available for comment on Sunday as the nation is celebrating its 151 birthday. Britain ruled Canada before 1867.
'UNSUSTAINABLE MARKET'
But for the 40 laid-off workers at Luxembourg-based Tenaris' AlgomaTubes plant in northern Ontario, July 1 brought bad news as the company adjusts output because of the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
""The implementation of a tariff has created an unsustainable market to serve our U.S. customers,"" David McHattie, a vice president for Tenaris Canada said, adding that the employees were hired in January to meet new demand for Tenaris products.
Reuters reported on June 27 that steel pipes and tubes used in drilling and transporting crude oil has flooded into Canada this spring, as Trump's steel tariffs forced producers from Asia to seek new markets, threatening jobs in the Canadian pipe-making sector.
Non-U.S. imports of drill pipe, casings and line pipe jumped 90 percent in April from a year earlier and their total value soared 80 percent to C$183 million ($137.3 million), customs data analyzed by Reuters showed. 
McHattie did not elaborate on production adjustments and 
declined to share employment levels or sale volumes for competitiveness reasons. 
Tenaris has been operating in Canada for the past 50 years and is a big supplier to the country's energy industry.
The U.S. tariffs took effect on March 23, though some U.S. allies including Canada were exempted until May 31. Canadian retaliatory tariffs took effect on Sunday.
Canadian authorities can levy special duties on unfairly subsidized steel, or temporarily restrict imports during a sudden surge with a ""safeguard action."" 
The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Canadian government is considering putting quotas or tariffs on certain steel imports from all its trading partners, citing people familiar with the matter.

Scheuer said the ministry was also monitoring cars from manufacturers outside of Germany, without specifying the brands, but could not take any action itself.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Trump sends high-level team to push exports at Farnborough Airshow: sources,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is sending a high-level delegation to this month's Farnborough Airshow to push the Trump administration's ""Buy American"" drive aimed at boosting exports of weapons and aircraft, industry sources familiar with the matter said.
The official U.S. delegation will be the highest ranking to attend the air show near London in recent memory and will be led by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, one of the main architects of the new arms export policy.
The White House's ""Buy American"" initiative, first reported by Reuters in April, aims to speed up arms deal approvals and increase the advocacy role of senior U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, in closing foreign sales, while giving greater weight to business interests in sales decisions that have long prioritized human rights.
The policy, officially named the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, also loosens U.S. export rules on equipment ranging from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery.
The ""whole of government"" approach, from Trump and his cabinet down to military attaches and diplomats, is meant to help drum up billions of dollars more in arms business. Trump himself has pushed weapons sales with foreign heads of state.
While Trump will be in Britain the weekend before the July 16 to July 22 Farnborough show - the largest commercial and military aerospace trade fair of the year - his current schedule does not show him attending. 
The State Department's Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson will attend, a U.S. Department of State official said.
In fiscal year 2017 the department authorized, licensed and provided oversight for $42 billion in government-to-government sales and $112 billion in direct commercial sales, the official said. There were more than $43.4 billion in sales to other governments in the first seven months of 2018, the official said.
The rest of the U.S. delegation will include officials from the Commerce Department, the Air Force and the Pentagon's weapons export administration, industry executives said. 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the delegation.
It will not be the first time that the Trump administration has stepped up its profile at an air show. In February, the United States sent its diplomat responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to promote U.S.-made weapons. 
Companies that stand to benefit most from the new policy include  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and the other top U.S. defense contractors,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT),  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC). 

Among the most important contracts up for grabs in the coming years are European nations seeking a new generation of fighter jet. Belgium has already been pre-approved by the U.S. government to buy 34 F-35s made by Lockheed in a sale worth more than $6 billion, but has yet to decide.

A Sinochem spokesman declined to comment on the personnel changes, or the possible merger of the companies.
A ChemChina media official did not respond to a request for comment. 
Talks to create a Chinese chemicals powerhouse were first reported in late 2016, but were dismissed by both companies as rumor. 
Reuters reported that the two companies accelerated negotiations around May last year, after regulators cleared ChemChina's $43 billion acquisition of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta. 
Beijing sees a Sinochem and ChemChina deal as a blueprint for streamlining and consolidating its sprawling, debt-heavy state-owned enterprises, leaving fewer, but more powerful, national champions.

VW has suspended Stadler, head of VW's most profitable brand, after German authorities arrested him as part of an emissions probe.
""It was a massive shock for me. The arrest of a CEO of a major car brand: that's never happened before,"" Diess told Germany newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
""The arrest is hard to comprehend. I knew Rupert Stadler as a problem solver,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. Diess said that for him, Diess was innocent until proven guilty. 
Stadler, who has not made any public comment, has not been charged and prosecutors are set to continue questioning him next week.
Asked whether he could imagine Stadler returning, Diess said it depended on what facts emerge: ""Should the accusations of the state prosecutors prove to be true, then it's a clear decision.""
He said that he did not believe Audi would suffer immediately from the departure of its CEO. 

""But if it lasts too long, then it does become a problem. However, I am convinced that we will get through this.""

930,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2018 12:44PM ET</span>",BMW says U.S. tariffs on EU cars may hit investment there,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs on imported cars could lead BMW (DE:BMWG) to reduce investment and cut jobs in the United States due to the large number of cars it exports from its South Carolina plant, the German carmaker has warned. 
President Trump's administration last month launched an investigation into whether auto imports posed a national security threat and Trump has threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports of EU-assembled cars. 
""The domestic manufacture of automobiles has no apparent correlation with U.S. national security,"" BMW wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross this week, adding that imposing duties would not increase U.S. growth and competitiveness. 
The BMW plant in South Carolina is its largest globally and ships more than 70 percent of its annual production to other export markets, the company said.
Chinese tariffs on U.S. passenger cars, imposed in retaliation for U.S. duties on Chinese goods, have already hiked up the cost of exporting to China, BMW said. Any U.S. tariffs would likely lead to further retaliatory measures from China and the European Union. 
In addition, higher tariffs on components imported to the United States would make other production locations outside the country more competitive. 
""All of these factors would substantially increase the costs of exporting passenger cars to these markets from the United States and deteriorate the market access for BMW in these jurisdictions, potentially leading to strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States,"" BMW said in the letter. 
Two major auto trade groups, one representing BMW among others, had earlier this week said that imposing up to 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars. 
""By insulating the United States from foreign competition, there is less incentive for American companies to strive to raise their productivity and look for ways and means of producing ever better goods (and services) ever more cheaply,"" BMW said.

""Just how much it's ultimately going to be will be determined when we know how debt and other things will be quantified,"" Joerg Reinhardt told the Swiss financial newspaper.
Novartis announced on Friday it is spinning off the eye care surgical equipment and contact lens unit, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The business no longer fits the drugmaker's strategy of focusing on prescription medicines, Novartis concluded.
The Basel-based company will also repurchase up to $5 billion in shares through the end of next year. 
Reinhardt said it was hard to determine whether Alcon, bought over time for $52 billion from Nestle in a deal concluded in 2011, ever really earned money for Novartis.
""Tough to say, since Alcon had to be revamped multiple times,"" he said. ""But I would say, all things considered, we didn't lose money on Alcon.""

Reinhardt also said there were no changes to Novartis's roughly $13 billion stake in Roche (S:ROG). His company has, for now, abandoned active plans to unload the package, and Reinhardt has returned to calling it ""a financial investment with a certain strategic component.""

932,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 11:12PM ET</span>",Missouri appeals court tosses $55 million J&J talc-powder verdict,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A Missouri appeals court on Friday threw out a $55 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in a lawsuit by a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using talc-based products, including J&J's baby powder, citing a U.S. Supreme court ruling on where such cases can be brought.
South Dakota resident Gloria Ristesund had been awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages in the 2016 verdict. 
She alleged that her decades-long use of J&J talc-based products for feminine hygiene caused her cancer, and that the company had failed to warn consumers about the risks.
J&J denied the allegations, saying decades of testing have shown its cosmetic talc-based products to be safe.
The healthcare conglomerate is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer and, in some cases, mesothelioma, a rare cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, amid allegations the products were contaminated with asbestos fibers. J&J has said its talc products do not contain asbestos or cause any form of cancer.
The unanimous three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals in the Eastern District, in overturning the verdict, did not rule on the merits of the allegations.
The judges instead said the verdict could not stand following a 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limits where companies can be sued for personal injuries.
The high court ruled that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state or when the alleged injuries did not occur there.
J&J is based in New Jersey and Ristesund exclusively purchased and used the company's talc products in South Dakota and Minnesota, according to court records.
J&J, in a statement, said it was extremely pleased with the court's decision to recognize that the trial should have never occurred.
Ristesund's case was one of more than 60 related talc lawsuits consolidated in Missouri state court, where juries have a reputation for issuing high-paying verdicts. But only one of those cases involved a woman from Missouri, leading many of the cases to be tossed on jurisdictional grounds.

During the appeals process, Ristesund asked the court for permission to present additional evidence tying J&J to Missouri. The judges on Friday rejected her request, saying she had ample opportunity to present such evidence over the past two years.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday found that pharmaceutical company  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) used sham litigation to illegally prevent generic versions of testosterone replacement drug AndroGel from getting to market and ordered the drugmaker and its partner to pay $448 million.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle in Philadelphia came in an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission against AbbVie and its partner Besins Healthcare Inc.
The decision followed a non-jury trial that tested the ability of the U.S. regulator to fight efforts by major pharmaceutical companies to prevent the sale of cheaper generic versions of their drugs.
""The FTC has established the actual market reality that defendants possessed monopoly power and illegally and willfully maintained that monopoly power through the filing of sham litigation,"" Bartle wrote.
Chicago-based AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment, but it denied the allegations at trial. A lawyer for privately-held Besins had no immediate comment.
The FTC has long fought against so-called ""pay for delay"" settlements, in which a brand-name drugmaker pays a generic rival to delay releasing a cheaper version of its product in exchange for resolving patent lawsuits.
In its lawsuit, the FTC accused AbbVie and Besins of filing baseless patent infringement lawsuits in 2011 against generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Perrigo Company to delay the launch of their generic versions of AndroGel.
The regulator alleged that as part of that effort, AbbVie and Besins entered into a pay-for-delay settlement with Teva, which helped delay generic drug competition.
Bartle in his ruling agreed the lawsuits were baseless and said that absent the litigation and settlement agreements stuck in the cases, Perrigo would have released a generic version of AndroGel in June 2013 rather than December 2014.
The judge ordered the companies to pay $448 million, representing their profits from June 2013 to August 2017.
He apportioned liability between AbbVie and Besins according to their agreed royalty rates. According to the ruling, Besins received 8 percent of U.S. net sales of AndroGel through March 2015, at which point the rate dropped to 5 percent.
The FTC, which had sought $1.35 billion, said the order was the largest award ever in an antitrust case that it litigated in court.

""It sends a clear signal that pharmaceutical companies can’t use baseless litigation to forestall competition from low-cost generics,"" FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As Toys ""R"" Us Inc stores across the United States marked their final day in business on Friday, the bankrupt toy retailer posted a farewell message to customers on its website next to an image of its iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot thanking them and urging them to ""Play on!""
""Thanks to each of you who shared your amazing journey to (and through) parenthood with us, and to every grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother and sister who's built a couch-cushion rocket ship, made up a hero adventure, or invented something gooey,"" the message said.
""Promise us just this one thing: Don't ever grow up. Play on!"" the message, playing on the company's famous jingle, added.
More than 700 Toys ""R"" Us stores are shuttering in the United States. The liquidation of the largest U.S. toy retailer is a blow to hundreds of toy makers that sold products at the chain, including Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT), board game company  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) and other large vendors such as Lego.
Its closure also leaves a void for small toymakers who relied on the company to showcase new products. 
Toys ""R"" Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September hoping to restructure some $5 billion in debt, much of which stemmed from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005. 
But the company changed course in March, saying it would sell its operations in Canada, Asia and Europe, and shut down in the United States.
In addition to online platforms like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), analysts have pointed to Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT), JC Penney Co Inc (N:JCP),  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (O:BBBY) as chains that could pick up market share from Toys 'R' Us. Drugstores like CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) and discount outlets like  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) or TJ Maxx (N:TJX) may also stock their shelves with more toys, they said.

In a dire retail landscape, more than 8,000 U.S. shops closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former partner at a major U.S. law firm who spent two decades as a fugitive while avoiding charges that he ran a fraudulent investment scheme pleaded guilty on Friday to having carried out a different scam while living in Massachusetts under an alias.
Scott Wolas, 69, pleaded guilty in Boston federal court to defrauding 20 investors in two real estate projects out of $1.7 million while he was using someone else's identity.
He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts that included wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 2.
The plea capped years of investigations of Wolas, who in the 1990s was a litigator in the New York office of Hunton & Williams, one of the country's largest law firms.
He disappeared amid claims he defrauded investors who had poured tens of millions of dollars into a fraudulent liquor exporting scheme, which became the basis of a 1997 indictment in New York charging him with fraud and grand larceny.
Authorities said Wolas went to Florida, where he became a broker with Securities America Inc while utilizing a college roommate's name.
In 2001, amid complaints by investors that he had stolen their money, the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a warrant for Wolas' arrest, according to court papers.
By then, Wolas had gone to Massachusetts, where he lived under various names, including that of a man he knew in Florida, Eugene Grathwohl, whose records, birth certificate and military discharge papers Wolas had stolen, prosecutors said.
Under Grathwohl's name, Wolas worked as a licensed real estate agent. In that role, prosecutors said, Wolas from 2014 to 2016 collected the $1.7 million from the investors that he largely used for personal expenses.
A week before the scheduled close on one of the properties in September 2016, Wolas disappeared, prosecutors said.
He was arrested in April 2017 at a condominium in Delray Beach, Florida, that his ex-wife helped him rent, prosecutors said.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Sandra Bower on Friday said in court that Wolas told a federal agent after he was arrested that he fled because he was ""concerned if there was a probe into his identity that it would all 'come down like a house of cards.'""

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) warned on Friday that higher tariffs on imported vehicles under consideration by the Trump administration could cost jobs and lead to a ""a smaller GM"" while isolating U.S. businesses from the global market.
The administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat, and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 20 percent vehicle import tariff. 
The largest U.S. automaker said in comments filed with the U.S. Commerce Department that overly broad tariffs could ""lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less — not more — U.S. jobs.""
Higher tariffs could also hike vehicle prices and reduce sales, GM said.
Its comments echoed those from two major U.S. auto trade groups on Wednesday, when they warned that tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.
Even if automakers opted not to pass on higher costs ""this could still lead to less investment, fewer jobs, and lower wages for our employees. The carry-on effect of less investment and a smaller workforce could delay breakthrough technologies,"" GM said.
GM operates 47 U.S. manufacturing facilities and employs about 110,000 people in the United States. It buys tens of billions of dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers every year, and has invested over $22 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2009.
Still, 30 percent of the vehicles GM sold on the U.S. market in 2017 were manufactured abroad, according to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research. Eighty-six percent of those vehicles came from Canada and Mexico, while others came from Europe and China.
Detroit automakers Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV also import many of the vehicles they sell in the United States.
""The overbroad and steep application of import tariffs on our trading partners risks isolating U.S. businesses like GM from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home,"" GM said.
Some aides have said that Trump is pursuing the national security probe to put pressure on Canada and Mexico to agree to concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
GM shares closed down about 2.8 percent on Friday at $39.40.
Toyota Motor Corp filed separate comments opposing the tariffs on Friday saying they would ""threaten U.S. manufacturing, jobs, exports, and economic prosperity.""
The company noted that Trump has repeatedly praised the Japanese automaker for investing in the United States, including a new $1.3 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with Mazda.
""These investments reflect our confidence in the U.S. economy and in the power of the administration’s tax cuts,"" Toyota said.
Toyota noted that international automakers assembling vehicles in the United States are based in countries including Japan, German and South Korea ""that are America’s closest allies."" 
The Commerce Department plans two days of public hearings next month and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week he aimed to wrap up the probe into whether imported vehicles represent a national security threat by late July or August.
“We have received approximately 2,500 comments already,"" Ross said in a statement on Friday, adding that he expected more before a midnight deadline.

""The purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for July 19th and 20th is to make sure that all stakeholders’ views are heard, both pro and con. That will enable us to make our best informed recommendation to the President,” the statement said.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled from Washington to New Jersey, Trump also said the United States has been treated very badly by the World Trade Organization but he is not considering withdrawing from it at this point.
Asked when the probe would be concluded, he said: ""Very soon. It'll be done in three, four weeks.""
Trump ordered the ""Section 232"" national security probe into autos on May 23, and his unusually fast timeline calls for it to be possibly completed in just over two months. Similar national security probes ordered last year that led to import tariffs of 25 percent steel and 10 percent on aluminum, took about 10 months to complete.
By law, the Commerce Department has 270 days to offer recommendations to the president after a Section 232 probe starts. The president then has 90 days to act upon those recommendations.

Written comments from interested parties in the autos probe were due on Friday, and the administration has scheduled a public hearing for July 19-20.

OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada struck back at the Trump administration on Friday over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, vowing to impose punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.63 billion) worth of American goods until Washington relents.
The retaliation came as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) warned that any tariffs Washington might impose on imported vehicles could cost U.S jobs, and as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin denied a report that President Donald Trump wanted to withdraw from the World Trade Organization.
Rising trade tension between Canada and the United States and a pushback from U.S. businesses on further tariffs, including on imported autos, pressured a White House that has championed an ""America First"" protectionist stance since Trump took office in January 2017.
Mnuchin lashed out against a report by the Axios news website that said Trump frequently told advisers he wanted the United States to quit the WTO, a move that could devastate global commerce. The report cited people involved in discussions with the president.
""This is an exaggeration,"" Mnuchin said. ""The president has been clear ... he has concerns about the WTO, he thinks there's aspects of it that are not fair, he thinks that China and others have used it to their own advantage, but we are focused on free trade. That's what we're focused on - breaking down barriers.""
Canada's retaliatory tariffs, effective on July 1, largely target U.S. steel and aluminum products, along with foodstuffs such as coffee, ketchup and whisky, according to a list released by Canada's Finance Department. 
""We will not escalate and we will not back down,"" Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters at a Stelco Holdings Inc plant in the steel city of Hamilton, Ontario.
The measures are designed to pressure Trump by focusing on goods from states where his Republican party is fighting to hold Congressional seats in the November miterm elections. They were announced just as America's largest automaker warned that overly broad tariffs could isolate U.S. businesses and cut jobs.
The Trump administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles posed a national security threat. Trump has repeatedly threatened a 20 percent import tariff on vehicles. 
In comments filed with the U.S. Commerce Department, GM said expansive tariffs could ""lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less — not more — U.S. jobs.""
GM, which makes many vehicles for the U.S. market in Mexico and Canada, said the tariffs could hike vehicle prices and reduce sales.
Even if automakers opted not to pass along higher costs to consumers, ""this could still lead to less investment, fewer jobs, and lower wages for our employees. The carry-on effect of less investment and a smaller workforce could delay breakthrough technologies,"" GM said. 
Canada's Freeland called the idea of auto tariffs ""absolutely absurd."" U.S. officials have linked the tariffs to slow progress in talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump says is a disaster and must be changed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major stock indexes edged higher on Friday, as a surge in  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares helped the quarter close out on an upswing while concerns over U.S. international trade relations ebbed.
For the quarter, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all posted gains. The Dow edged up 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 rose 2.94 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 6.33 percent. The small-cap Russell 2000, whose components are more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, climbed 7.4 percent.
Like the Russell, the S&P's major sectors reflected some skittishness over trade. Energy had the biggest percentage gains for the quarter as oil prices jumped, and growth sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary stocks had solid gains. But real estate and utilities, considered defensive sectors, also advanced.

On Friday, shares of Nike soared 13 percent to hit an all-time high of $81 after the world's largest footwear maker reported a return to growth in North America in the last quarter and gave an upbeat forecast for the year.
Nike shares ended the day up 11.1 percent to $79.68, their biggest one-day gain in nearly four years. Nike was the top boost to the Dow and the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 bank sector index ended the day barely changed after earlier touching a one-week high. The Federal Reserve late on Thursday reported that U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Fed's annual stress tests, though the Fed placed conditions on some, restricting  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) from increasing capital distributions.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co was a bright spot, rising 3.4 percent. 
Friday's session reflected momentary relief from trade concerns that rattled the market earlier in the week, several investors said, though the major indexes pared gains in the last hour of trading.
""There's really not a lot of headlines going on,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We're having a late-week bounce back from earlier worries.""
Investors took in stride U.S. Commerce Department data that showed consumer spending slowing as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a measure of inflation, hit the Federal Reserve's 2 percent annual target for the first time in six years. On several occasions this year, worries of rising inflation and a subsequent economic slowdown have sent stocks tumbling.
""People are squaring away positions going into the month and the quarter's end,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55.36 points, or 0.23 percent, to 24,271.41, the S&P 500 gained 2.06 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,718.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.62 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,510.30.

For the week, however, all three indexes registered losses. The Dow lost 1.26 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.33 percent, and the Nasdaq shed 2.37 percent. The Dow declined for three straight weeks for the first time in more than two years.
For the month of June, the Dow lost 0.59 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 0.49 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.92 percent.
On Friday, shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) jumped 15.2 percent, the most on the S&P 500, after rival Galapagos NV's cystic fibrosis program reported disappointing trial data.
KB Home shares climbed 7.3 percent after the homebuilder's second-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates. The strong results also boosted shares of other homebuilders, including D.R. Horton Inc and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM). 
Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) fell 5.8 percent after the Corona beer maker's quarterly profit and full-year earnings forecast missed analysts' estimates. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 52 new highs and 67 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.16 billion shares, compared to the 7.28 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This year's Federal Reserve stress test results suggested a more flexible approach, a further sign the regulator's new leadership is responding positively to a Wall Street push for pragmatic bank supervision, analysts and lawyers said. 
Banks that took a one-off capital hit due to the 2017 U.S. tax overhaul got a conditional pass, a departure from the Fed's traditional strict pass-fail approach to quantitative capital issues, while scandal-plagued  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co was able to double share buyback plans. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were dinged since their capital fell below the Fed's minimum, but the regulator's response this year sounded a more industry-friendly tone under Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, President Donald Trump appointees, analysts and lawyers said.
""They have allowed firms to pass on the basis there were special circumstances and applied a level of pragmatism in the way they haven't in the past. This is the new Fed and it signals to me an early retirement of this super-strict quantitative test,"" said Mike Alix, financial services risk leader at PwC.
The Fed on Thursday approved the capital plans of 34 lenders following the second leg of its annual tests, a process introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to assess banks' capacity to withstand a severe recession. The U.S. central bank has ramped up its worst-case scenarios each year. 
The U.S. tax code rewrite signed into law in December meant Goldman and Morgan Stanley's Thursday results were weighed, in part, by changes to the treatment of past losses on hypothetical tax bills under the Fed's scenarios.
But since the tax issue was a one-off and capital levels in the system are high, the Fed felt it was unnecessary to fail the two banks, senior Fed officials said.
Under the conditional approvals for their capital plans, the two banks can pay out capital distributions but must keep them in line with previous years. 
Some analysts pointed to the Fed's conditional approval of State Street Corp's higher dividend even though its counterparty exposures showed high losses under the scenarios.
""This reinforces how the Federal Reserve was less draconian in how it reacted to the results,"" said Cowen Washington Research Group's Jaret Seiberg in a note. 
Wells Fargo won approval for the highest payout ratio of the major U.S. banks, quashing investor concerns it would fail the part of the test measuring operational controls.
A passing grade could signal clearer skies ahead for Wells Fargo and better relations with regulators, according to analysts at Evercore Group LLC. 
Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown on Thursday criticized bank payouts to “wealthy shareholders” and warned the Fed against easing up on how it approaches the tests.
STRESS BUFFER
Lenders have long complained the stress-test process is too opaque and that the Fed has been too harsh on firms whose results fall short of models the Fed keeps secret.
Despite noting the Fed's pragmatic stance on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, industry insiders still questioned whether the regulator should have proceeded with the tough scenarios this year given the short-term adverse tax changes, and said they want further changes to make the process more transparent.
Powell and Quarles have said they believe stress-testing can be more transparent and less discretionary, but banks continue to worry that Fed rule-easing may not go far enough or could inadvertently make life tougher if changes are not finely tuned.
They point, for example, to the Fed's April proposal to introduce a ""stress capital buffer"" that would work in tandem with the stress tests to move the system away from a strict annual quantitative pass-fail. 
In a blog post published on Friday, bank trade group The Clearing House warned the proposal as written could actually exacerbate their capital planning challenges by requiring banks to capitalize themselves against stress losses year-round.

""This year’s results illustrate that capital requirements in the United States are highly volatile from year to year and that the volatility will be magnified by ... the stress buffer,"" they added.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","Mexican markets poised for leftist win, but wary of landslide","By Miguel Gutierrez and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexican markets have rallied this month into a likely win by the leftist frontrunner in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday, but local assets could sell-off if a landslide victory for his party forms a congressional majority.
Ahead of the July 1 vote, Mexico's peso  firmed to its strongest since late May in early trading Friday before reversing direction and sinking around 1 percent. Stocks (MXX) rose to their highest in more than eight weeks.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a fierce critic of the ruling elite, held a wide margin in final polls. He would become Mexico's first left-leaning leader for decades if elected on Sunday.
Analysts said Lopez Obrador's economic team has been out in force to mollify investor concerns about a possible stark departure from pro-market policies or fiscal discipline. So far, markets are betting on moderate polices in line with Peru's Ollanta Humala or Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
""His discourse has moderated and his economic advisors have been seeking a vote of confidence,"" said James Salazar, an analyst at CI Banco.
But bets in the options market suggest there could be big moves in the peso and stocks. One-month implied volatility , a gauge of expected near-term currency movement, has fallen from a spike earlier in June. But it remains at elevated levels seen back before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who many worried could rip up the NAFTA free trade deal with Mexico and Canada his first day in office.
Karl Schamotta, a strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto, said the market had largely priced in a Lopez Obrador victory and was betting on moderate economic policies.
""There is an assumption that he is campaigning from the left and will govern further to the right,"" he said.
Some analysts said the end of uncertainty could help the peso post modest gains after a victory by Lopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is known. They said the currency could rally sharply if there was a surprise victory by either of his opponents, Ricardo Anaya from the right-left coalition or the ruling party's Jose Antonio Meade. 
But they cautioned that the peso could tumble on fears of more radical policies if Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party gains a majority in Congress.
""An AMLO outperformance could lead to a sell-off of Mexican assets,"" said Nomura analyst Benito Berber.
Results of congressional races may not be clear early next week. But if Lopez Obrador wins more than 42 percent of the presidential vote, a MORENA majority looks much more likely, analysts said.
Schamotta said volatility levels suggest the peso could move between 3 percent and 5 percent, either way, if the election throws up an unexpected outcome, with a more muted move in the event of an expected Lopez Obrador victory.
Bets in the U.S. equity options market are slightly skewed toward potential losses in stocks, with more put options than calls in play, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
Open contracts on the $1.12 billion U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (P:EWW) imply a roughly 4 percent swing in the shares, in either direction, by July 6.

""Net-net looks like positioning of late has a bearish bias,"" said Jim Strugger, derivatives strategist at MKM Partners in New York.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>","Halfway through, 2018 delivers little to S&P 500 investors","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Halfway through 2018, investing in Wall Street's leading S&P 500 stock index has been nothing to shout about.
The index of about 500 of the largest U.S. corporations has risen 1.7 percent year to date, far short of its 8 percent increase in the first half of 2017, even as the technology-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) and Russell 2000 index (RUT) of smaller companies touch record highs. 
Including dividends, the S&P 500 (SPX) has returned only about 3 percent in 2018, compared with nearly 22 percent last year.

While newly enacted corporate tax cuts propelled a nine-year bull market higher in January, fears of an escalating trade war between the United States and China have lately become a persistent counterweight denting investor sentiment.
Investors currently favor small-cap stocks because they are seen as benefiting more than large companies from the deepest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, with some on Wall Street also betting that smaller companies may be less at risk of trade tariffs.
The Russell 2000 index is up 7 percent year to date, while the Nasdaq has surged 9 percent, buoyed by the tech sector's popularity with investors.
To view a graphic on U.S.-China trade and the S&P 500, click: https://reut.rs/2ICOULJ
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) has declined 2 percent in the past six months, weighed down by double-digit declines in 3M Co (N:MMM), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG),  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), and  General Electric  Co (N:GE), which in June was evicted from the group of 30 top-shelf U.S. corporations.
Market strategists polled by Reuters last month predicted on average that the S&P 500 would post an annual gain of 7 percent in 2018, more modest than the 9 percent increase they predicted in a February survey.
After the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Jan 26, the index has fallen 5 percent, with declines in banks and consumer staples more than offsetting a recovery in technology stocks including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), both up close to 10 percent in the past six months.

Financials, which account for about 13 percent of the S&P 500, have been badly bruised by Wall Street's stumble, falling 11 percent since the index's record high.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) have each fallen 15 percent or more during that time.
To view a graphic on Financials Since Jan 26, click: https://reut.rs/2IAPlGv
While 2018 has offered scant returns for S&P 500 investors, it has provided more than its share of volatility. Twenty-nine percent of trading sessions in the first half of 2018 saw moves greater than 1 percent in either direction, compared with just 3.2 percent of trading days in all of 2017, according to a report from Bespoke Investment Group.
Optimism around the tax cuts has Wall Street expecting S&P 500 earnings per share to surge 22 percent in 2018. Those unusually high earnings projections, and the stock market's mostly lateral movement over the past five months, have made stock valuations appear more reasonable than they had late in 2018.
The S&P 500 is now trading at just over 16 times expected earnings, down from over 18 at the market's high in January, and in line with the index's five-year average valuation, according to Thomson Reuters data.

944,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 04:47PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. US Stocks End Month Negative as Global Trade Tussle Heats Up 
Forays higher in U.S. stocks were met with heavy selling pressure this week as lingering trade war concerns continued to keep traders on the defensive.
Stocks appeared to be given a lifeline earlier in the week, when U.S. President Donald Trump decided against imposing a harsh measure to restrict Chinese investment in U.S. based technology.
But the euphoria proved to be short-lived as markets reversed course ahead of initial U.S. and Chinese tariffs due to take effect next week.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was back in the headlines after the e-commerce giant announced its entry into the pharmacy sector with the purchase of Pillpoint, triggering widespread panic, sending shares of brick-and-mortar drug stores sharply lower.
 Nike  , meanwhile, showed improved results – beating on both the top and bottom lines – after revealing its first positive North America sales number in over a year.
Shares of Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) closed 11.13% higher Friday at $79.68.
The S&P 500 closed 0.08% higher to close 2,718.37
2. Crude Oil Prices Settle Above $74 for First Time Since November 2014 
Crude oil prices staged a four-day rally to end the week at their highest settlement since November 2014.
The rally in crude prices – for a fourth-straight week – emerged as focus shifted to the prospect of deeper losses of Iranian crude supplies as the U.S. threatened sanctions on countries that fail to halt Iranian crude imports by Nov. 4.
Unexpected disruptions in Canada, Libya and Venezuela, meanwhile, reined in supply, further lifting sentiment on oil prices.
Oil prices were also supported by a weekly Energy Information Administration report showing U.S. crude supplies fell by 9.9 million barrels in the week ended June 22.
Crude futures settled 65 cents higher on Friday as data showed U.S. oil rigs counts fell for the second straight week, pointing to signs of tightening domestic output.
3. Dollar Suffers Wobble to Close Week Roughly Flat
The dollar was roughly unchanged for the week against its rivals as heavy selling pressure Friday eased earlier gains rivals after the euro rallied sharply as traders cheered an EU migration deal.
European Union member states Friday struck an migration deal, agreeing on several measures to tackle the migrant crises in the EU including stepping up border security and setting up holding centers to handle asylum seekers.
The deal was cheered by traders as it eased political uncertainty within the bloc, sending the EUR/USD sharply higher, to $1.1677, up 0.94%.
The dollar fell 0.82% to 94.22 against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Suffers Biggest Monthly Slump Since September 
Gold prices were on the backfoot for most of the week as dollar strength stifled demand for the yellow metal, which suffered its biggest monthly slump since September.
Gold struggled to capture the flows into safe-havens seen earlier this week as traders feared further downside beckons as inflation hit the Fed's 2% target for the first time since May 2012, raising the prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes.
The Fed has said, however, that it is comfortable with inflation running above target over the near-term.
5. Crypto Crunch Continues 
There was no respite for Bitcoin this week as traders continued to pull billions from the market, raising the risk of further losses for the popular crypto.
Bitcoin's failure to hold $6,000 has fuelled expectations that it could swing lower to levels not seen since October.
Another leg lower to below $5,000 could generate support – price levels that trigger buying – for the beleaguered crypto, according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:ALVG).
""I don't think you (Bitcoin) get all the way back to $20,000, but I do think that you need to establish a base whereby the people who really believe in the future of bitcoin consolidate and then that provides you a lift,"" El-Erian said on CNBC.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin fell 4.01% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum fell 12.95%, while Ripple XRP fell 12.55% on the Poloniex exchange."

946,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC accuses ex-Cantor Fitzgerald brokers of secret commission sharing,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators on Friday charged two former Cantor Fitzgerald & Co brokers with sharing commissions on customer transactions off the books, and announced the firm had agreed to pay $1.25 million to resolve the related claims.
In a civil complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the brokers, Adam Mattessich and Joseph Ludovico, led to ""widespread"" violations of a federal securities law that requires brokerages to keep accurate records of transactions and compensation.
Lawyers for Mattessich, 47, and Ludovico, 41, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Karen Laureano-Rikardsen, a spokeswoman for Cantor, declined to comment. The company agreed to the $1.25 million settlement without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC said.
According to the complaint, Mattessich in 2002 asked that Cantor pay him commissions on transactions on customer accounts he serviced, but his supervisor refused and ordered him to transfer the accounts to more junior traders.
Mattessich then approached two junior traders, Ludovico and another person not named in the complaint, about an agreement to circumvent his supervisor's decision, according to the SEC. Mattessich transferred accounts to Ludovico and the other trader, who were eligible to receive commissions, and had them pay him a share by personal check, the SEC said.
Ludovico also benefited financially by receiving additional customer accounts from Mattessich, the SEC said.
In 2004, Mattessich was promoted to supervise Ludovico and the other junior trader directly, the SEC said. His new role created a conflict of interest that, by ""risking compromising Mattessichs' supervision, posed a risk of harm to Cantor’s customers and counterparties,"" the complaint said.
In 2011, Mattessich arranged for another subordinate, who was not named, to begin receiving off-the-books commissions from Ludovico and the other junior sales trader, according to the complaint.
Ludovico in 2013 paid Mattessich at least $58,200 in off-the-books commissions, which Mattessich hid from both Cantor and tax authorities, the SEC said.

After legal and compliance personnel at Cantor were alerted about the arrangement, the firm's chief compliance officer sent an email to employees in January 2014 reminding them that off-the-books commission splitting was prohibited, the SEC said. Mattessich and Ludovico were allowed to resign voluntarily in February 2018, the complaint said.

Since 2009, Morgan Stanley has allowed brokers to initiate wire transfers of as much as $100,000 from a client's brokerage account into a third-party account so long as the adviser reported on an internal digital form that the client had requested the transfer over the phone or in person. 
The brokerage required some additional information and had policies in place allowing it to review some disbursement requests, the SEC said. But the regulator said the policies were insufficient in preventing one broker from misappropriating $5 million worth of clients' money without their permission between December 2015 and November 2016.
Former Morgan Stanley broker Barry Connell was arrested in February 2017 and faces criminal charges in a federal court in New York related to the alleged misappropriations. His case is pending.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 03:26PM ET</span>","After stellar run, smallcaps may see some turbulence","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a strong rally that saw the Russell 2000 notch a record in three straight sessions in June, smallcap stocks may be showing signs of slowing down, leading some market participants to question whether their recent bulletproof performance is starting to crack. 
After hitting lows on Feb. 8, the Russell 2000 (RUT) has risen more than 12 percent, far outpacing the gain of 5.2 percent in the largecap S&P 500 (SPX) index.
The smallcap index on Friday snapped an eight-week winning streak, however, posting its largest weekly decline since late March, which could indicate the start of a cooling off period. 
""We are seeing an inverse relationship between size and value, the bigger stocks are the better bargains and the smaller stocks aren’t,"" said Craig Callahan, President at ICON Funds in Denver.
""That would make me skeptical that over the next full year the smallcaps could keep leading.""
Investors have rushed into smallcaps this year, and the trend continued this past week. Lipper data on Thursday showed smallcap growth funds attracted $595 million of inflows for the week, their seventh straight week of gains.
""The big thing has been the amount of money into smallcaps in general, we have seen an awful lot of money just come pouring in,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.

Smallcaps have become attractive to investors for a number of reasons. Since they are mostly domestically focused, investors reason they are more insulated from a potential trade war than a larger company with more of a global footprint.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Friday a report by the Axios news website, which cited sources as saying President Donald Trump wanted the United States to withdraw from the World Trade Organization, was wrong.
That domestic focus is also beneficial to smallcaps in the face of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which can dent overseas profits of larger multinational companies. After declining nearly 10 percent in 2017, the greenback (DXY) has rebounded in the second quarter with a gain of more than 5 percent against a basket of major currencies. 
Smaller names are also expected to see a bigger benefit from the tax cuts announced by the Trump administration, with the effective tax rates for smallcaps changed to 21 percent from 28 percent, while large caps will only see their effective rate move down from an average of about 24 percent, according to Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivative strategist at BTIG in New York. 
""The price action is confirming the fact that everything is now in smallcaps' favor,"" said Emanuel. 
But, Emanuel cautions that the Russell 2000 has underperformed in July, relative to the S&P 500, as trades from the late June Russell rebalancing of its indexes unwind. Since 2000, the Russell has underperformed the S&P by 1.1 percent in July, according to BTIG.
And with May data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses showing its small business optimism index registering the second-highest reading in its history, a pullback is more likely, leaving not much room for further increases. 
""If you look at the small business confidence chart it is hard to make the case you are going to go higher, and if you don’t, it is hard to make the case that smallcaps stocks aren’t going to underperform, then you throw on top of it the seasonality,"" said Emanuel. 
Even with these headwinds, smallcaps may still perform better on a relative basis than larger names should trade worries persist, according to Lori Calvasina, head of u.s. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
RBC recently upgraded their neutral view on smallcaps to one of preference over largecaps.
""We are waking up in 2018 figuring out that the protectionist rhetoric from the summer of 2016 is real. It is a real underlying philosophy of this administration so I don’t think it is unwise to position accordingly,"" said Calvasina. 

""We don’t think there are any winners in a trade war, but it a question of who the relative losers are - small caps lose less.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada struck back at the Trump administration over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs on Friday, vowing to impose punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.63 billion) worth of American goods until Washington relents.
The announcement by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland marks a new low in ties between the neighbors and trading partners which have become increasingly strained since U.S. President Donald Trump took power in January 2017. 
The Canadian tariffs will come into effect on July 1 and largely target U.S. steel and aluminum products, but also foodstuffs such as coffee, ketchup and whiskies, according to a list by the Department of Finance. https://tinyurl.com/y8w5g895
""We will not escalate and we will not back down,"" Freeland told reporters at a Stelco Holdings Inc plant in the Ontario steel city of Hamilton.
Officials say the measures are designed in part to pressure Trump by focusing on goods from states where his political allies hold sway.
Canada's Liberal party government said last month it would retaliate after Trump moved against steel and aluminum imports from Canada and other nations, citing security grounds.
""We are acting very much in sorrow, not in anger,"" said Freeland, stressing the closeness of the overall relationship. Bilateral trade is worth around C$2 billion a day.
Freeland said she had already spoken to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer six times this week and was prepared to meet at any time to tackle the issue. 
Ottawa also unveiled an aid package for affected industries and workers worth up to C$2 billion, consisting mainly of up to C$1.7 billion in commercial financing and insurance for firms in the steel and aluminum sectors and related industries.
The Trump administration is studying whether to put tariffs on Canadian autos, which economists say would help plunge the economy into a recession. Freeland called the idea ""absolutely absurd"".
The U.S. embassy in Ottawa said it had no immediate comment.
While opposition parties have so far largely backed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for standing up to Trump, their support could be tested once the U.S. tariffs start to bite.
Trudeau, who usually attends celebrations in Ottawa on July 1 to mark the Canada Day holiday, will instead spend part of the weekend with families of steel workers in the western province of Saskatchewan, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said on Twitter. Goodale is from Saskatchewan, where Evraz plc has a major plant.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said earlier this month the tariffs were designed in part to stop cheap steel entering the United States via Canada and other countries.
Ottawa would take measures to stop the dumping of steel in the coming weeks once it had finished consulting stakeholders, said Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, appearing at the same event as Freeland.
In Washington, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the tariffs would hit $170 million worth of U.S. beef products.
""We believe that cooperation is a better path forward than escalation,"" said Kent Bacus, the association's director of international trade and market access. 
U.S. officials have also linked the tariffs to slow progress in talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump says is a disaster and must be changed.
Freeland said she expected the negotiations would enter an intensive phase after a Mexican presidential election on July 1.

The Treasury and Internal Revenue Service unveiled a draft of the new form, saying it would work with the tax community over the summer to finalize what they called a ""postcard-size"" document meant to be used by 150 million individual U.S. taxpayers.
""The new, postcard-size Form 1040 is designed to simplify and expedite filing tax returns, providing much-needed relief to hardworking taxpayers,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. The form is intended to replace three versions of the current 1040 form. 
Trump's deficit-financed tax overhaul, which delivered $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals over the next decade, was expected to simplify filing by reducing the number of taxpayers with returns claiming deductions for mortgages, investment income and other items. 
The law doubled to $24,000 the amount of income that a married couple can exclude from their taxes.
But Democrats warned that the new form requires taxpayers to include the same amount of tax math in a smaller space, saying individuals will have to rifle through complicated instructions and attach multiple documents.
""The administration's new tax form is a smokescreen designed to conceal paperwork, additional calculations and Trump's broken promise to simplify the tax code,"" Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. 

""It won't take long for America to realize this postcard isn't simple – it's simply complicated,"" he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co has been hit with a lawsuit by a Texas jewelry company accusing it of encouraging thousands of retailers nationwide to charge hidden fees to customers using financing programs created by the bank.
Then lawsuit, filed on Thursday in San Francisco federal court, said retailers were told to build financing fees into the price of goods and advertise that purchases could be financed interest-free. In reality, the higher purchase price amounted to a hidden, double-digit interest charge, the lawsuit said. 
It alleges violations of the U.S. Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to clearly disclose financing charges. The complaint was filed by El Paso, Texas-based J Edwards Jewelry Distributing and its president, John Silverman, as a proposed class action on behalf of over 5,000 retailers nationwide.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Hilary O'Byrne said the bank has received the lawsuit and is reviewing its claims but cannot comment further on pending litigation.
The finance programs went by such names as Wells Fargo Jewelry Advantage or Wells Fargo Home Projects. 
The fourth-biggest U.S. bank, Wells Fargo has also been grappling with a sales scandal involving unauthorized accounts. In April, it agreed to pay $1 billion to settle regulators' allegations that it forced unneeded auto insurance on consumers and charged homebuyers excessive fees. 
Thursday's lawsuit said the financing programs were advertised at retailers' stores and on their websites, but Wells Fargo controlled how merchants could describe them. Retailers were told they could not charge a fee for customers using Wells Fargo financing but could inflate a purchase price to cover the fees, the lawsuit said. 
In a typical purchase, a customer might pay $3,000 for a ring and zero interest if the full amount was paid within 60 months, the complaint said. The retailer forfeited 22.5 percent of the cost to Wells Fargo in exchange for the zero percent financing, the lawsuit said. 
Customers could buy the same ring for just $2,325 if they paid in cash, saving $675, the lawsuit said. Customers using Wells Fargo financing were thus paying $675 in undisclosed finance charges, it said. 
Wells Fargo likely collects as much as $800 million a year in hidden finance charges through the programs, the lawsuit said.
Because finance charges were built into a purchase price, the lawsuit said, retailers also had to remit more sales taxes to local governments than they otherwise would have. 
The case is Silverman et al v Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. District Court, California Northern District, No 18-3886

Minority shareholders in MAN will receive a gross annual payment of 5.50 euros per share, which is 2.20 euros more than Volkswagen has paid.
They can also, within two months, hand over their shares in return for a payment of 90.29 euros each, MAN said in a statement. That compares to 80.89 euros previously offered by Volkswagen.
The ruling by the Munich Higher Regional Court, which confirms a lower court decision and is final, resolves a dispute dating back to a domination and profit transfer agreement signed in 2013 after VW acquired just over 75 percent of MAN's shares.
Volkswagen plans to rename its VW Truck & Bus unit Traton and is considering a stock market listing for the unit, which also owns Sweden's Scania, that could raise 6 billion euros or more. 
Shares in MAN earlier closed 5 percent higher at 96.95 euros.

(Reuters) - Shares in the biggest U.S. banks rose on Friday after the Federal Reserve completed its annual stress test giving financial institutions the go-ahead for plans to return capital to investors through dividends and buybacks. 
The S&P 500 bank sector index <.SPXBK> was last up 1.9 percent after touching its highest level in a week.  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) led the pack with a 5.1 percent gain, and most of the index's other banks rose more than 1 percent. 
 Deutsche Bank  AG's (DE:DBKGn) U.S. subsidiary was the only bank to fail due to ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in its capital planning controls. 
The Fed also placed conditions on three banks that passed the test. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) cannot increase capital distributions and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) must improve its counterparty risk management and analysis, the Fed said.
Aberdeen Standard Investments equity analyst Michael Cronin said the results were a modest positive for stocks in the sector, which has been pressured recently by concerns about a flattening yield curve.
""Overall things look OK. The big winner is probably Wells Fargo because there was a little concern about them going into CCAR. They also had a good size capital return,"" said Cronin. 
The test results are ""not really huge needle movers for estimates overall. At best you're up a couple of percent in annual estimates but nothing to move the group significantly,"" he said. 
For a list of payout plans announced by banks:
Keefe Bruyette & Woods said payouts were below expectations for the majority of the 23 banks it covers, with the test tougher than it expected. The median gross payout ratio of 93 percent was up from 86 percent a year ago but below KBW's 101 percent expectation. 
Four banks had payout ratios that exceeded KBW expectations by 10 percentage points or more, while 11 fell short of its estimates by 10 percentage points or more. 
The payout ratio from M&T Bank Corp (N:MTB), last up 2.4 percent, beat KBW's expectations by 31 percentage points while Suntrust Banks Inc (N:STI), last up 1.9 percent, beat by 30 percentage points and KeyCorp (N:KEY), up 2.4 percent, beat by 25 percentage points.
However, the payout from State Street Corp (N:STT) was 36 percentage points below KBW's estimate while BB&T Corp (N:BBT) undershot by 30 percentage points and PNC Financial (N:PNC) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) both came in 28 percentage points lower.
But even most banks that missed analyst payout estimates saw a bump in their shares, with State Street up 0.9 percent, BB&T gaining 1.5 percent and Bank of America rising 0.5 percent.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley shares were flat.

The broader S&P Financial index (SPSY) was up 1.4 percent to its highest level since Monday. It had ended a record 13-day losing streak on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (N:F) long-time top lobbyist is leaving the No. 2 U.S. automaker to join Japan's Softbank Group (T:9984), which is muscling up its Washington efforts, the companies said on Friday.
Ziad Ojakli, a Ford group vice president who has led the Detroit auto maker's government relations strategy since 2004 and was a White House aide under President George W. Bush, will leave the automaker July 15. He will join SoftBank effective Aug. 1 and establish its U.S. government affairs practice.
""Ziad is one of the world’s most successful and respected government affairs executives with a proven track record managing issues for large global entities where business interests intersect with public policy,"" said Marcelo Claure, chief operating officer of Softbank Group and chairman of its Sprint Corp (N:S) unit, in a statement. 
Softbank is seeking regulatory approval in Washington for Sprint to tie-up with T Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS).
""As SoftBank delivers on its commitment to invest in the U.S. economy, our global portfolio of companies will benefit tremendously from his expertise,"" Claure said.
Ford faces numerous challenges in Washington, including ongoing trade issues, as well as the Trump administration's plan to revise fuel economy standards through 2025.
On Thursday, President Donald Trump said SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son was boosting his investment in the United States to $72 billion, significantly more than the $50 billion he had previously pledged.
""His $50 billion turned out to be $72 billion so far, he's not finished yet,"" Trump said, without providing details.
Trump's comments came at a groundbreaking ceremony in Wisconsin for a manufacturing facility for Foxconn, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer, attended by Son and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou.
Ojakli said in a statement: ""SoftBank is a critical and growing contributor to the U.S. economy, and it’s an honor to establish its government affairs practice in the U.S. and around world.""
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr praised Ojakli's work, saying ""he has been instrumental in driving global policy outcomes and leading philanthropic programs that support Ford’s vision for growth and a better world.""

The company's lobbying efforts will be led in the immediate future by Stephen Biegun, who is Ford's vice president of International Governmental Affairs.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Trillion dollar wipeout: world stocks' worst first half since 2010,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - If last year's financial markets boom was down to a 'Goldilocks' global economy, 2018 has so far been all about the bears, with the worst start to a year for world stocks since 2010.
A grizzly mix of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in hotspots including Europe has wiped a trillion dollars off MSCI's 47-country world index.
A pumped-up dollar (DXY), which has had its best first half in three years, and a 16 percent leap in oil prices (LCOc1) have played a big role too clobbering emerging markets particularly hard.
Argentina's peso <ARS=> and Turkey's lira <TRY=> have been shredded 30 and 17 percent, respectively, Chinese stocks have entered bear market territory and EM equities (MSCIEF) have slumped 10 percent, or 17 percent excluding a brief January surge.
""People just woke up to the fact that something has changed,"" said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner.
As well as the escalation in global trade tensions ""there has been a realization that the big central banks aren't thinking about stimulating the economy anymore, they are trying to build up capacity in case of recession.""
(Graphic: World stocks have worst H1 since 2010 - https://reut.rs/2IyNguk)
Still, it hasn't been a doom-fest everywhere.
One Wall Street bellwether, the S&P 500 (SPX), is clinging on in positive territory and while the trade jitters have sapped the Dow Jones Industrial (DJI), the Nasdaq (NDX) has set records this month.
As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) are up almost 40 percent despite having $400 billion wiped off their combined value in March when it was revealed Facebook misused 50 million of its users' data.
Netflix has more than doubled in price this year, Amazon (O:AMZN) is up 45 percent and Facebook (O:FB) is fully recovered and up over 11 percent. Also, for all the pressure heaped on China in recent months, its tech giant  Alibaba  (K:BABA) is up 11 percent.
YUAN TO AVOID?
Among the major currencies, the dollar is up almost 3 percent against the euro (EUR=) and nearly 2 percent versus the safe-haven yen <JPY=> (DXY).
For emerging markets that rise has been a wrecking ball. On top of the ailing lira and peso, Brazil's real is down 14 percent, India's rupee 7 percent, South Africa's rand 10 percent and - despite the oil rally - Russia's rouble 9 percent.
(Graphic: EM FX H1 performance - https://reut.rs/2NaEzu7)
Having been the stars of 2017, MSCI's EM equities index (MSCIEF) is down 8 percent and local currency and dollar-denominated EM bonds have fallen 6 percent and 5 percent respectively .
What has caused the most concern though has been China.
Stocks there entered a bear market this week having dropped 20 percent from their January peaks, while the yuan <CNY=CFXS> has just had its worst month on record.
With China the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has also contributed to the respective 9 and 15 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc , used in things like pipes and galvanized steel.
""What tends to move markets the most tends to be issues with China,"" said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer for Private Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), saying it was both her biggest short-term and longer-term worry.
""These tensions with the U.S. are not going to disappear, they are just going to ebb and flow,"" she said, adding the economy was also imbalanced and had very high debt levels.
Another 2017 high-flier, cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), has lost 60 percent, but even traditional safe havens have failed to provide protection over the last few months.
Another two U.S. interest hikes have seen Treasuries (US10YT=RR) cost holders 3 percent this year and German Bunds (DE10YT=RR) and gold <XAU=> are both down 4 percent.
Italy's government bonds meanwhile have plunged 13 percent this quarter as an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its mass bond buying program will end this year.
In contrast to Wall Street and Japan's Nikkei's solid first halves, euro zone stocks are down too, having lost roughly 6 percent.

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) shares jumped 12 percent to their all-time high on Friday after the world's largest shoe maker saw a major sales rebound in its North America business and forecast strong growth for 2019.
At least 14 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets following Nike's better-than-expected quarterly results, with Susquehanna the most bullish, raising its target by $14.
""Nike delivered the closest thing to a complete game for a public company,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Matthew McClintock, who boosted his target to $85 from $80.
The company's focus on its digital platform and launch of sneakers, such as Air Max 270 and Epic React, not only helped it fight off competition from German rivals Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and Puma, but also deliver on its promise of a significant reversal in its home market.
The Oregon-based company is also gaining on the resurgence of '90s fashion trends that is helping boost sales of its classic sneakers. Industry research shows that sneaker sales rose 10 percent globally last year.
Nike shares rose to $79.98 in early trading, adding $13 billion to its market value of about $115 billion. The stock was the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI).
Sales at its North America business rose 3.3 percent in the quarter after having fallen for most of the year.
""The Nike story is officially back at this point and investors will no longer have an opportunity to 'wait for a better entry point' as all signs point to an acceleration,"" McClintock said.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said strong results prove that several years of distribution disruption, bloated inventories, lackluster innovation, and market share losses are in the past.
The company also said it expects 2019 revenue to be in the high single-digit range, compared with its earlier forecast of mid-to-high single-digit growth. It also announced a $15 billion buyback program.
""Nike's business is beginning to inflect in NA, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas (DE:ADSGn),"" Jefferies analysts said in a note titled 'Share Gains Back = ADI-os!'
Nike's shares have risen nearly 15 percent this year, while Adidas' shares have gained 10 percent. Nike trades at 26.5 times forward earnings, versus Adidas' 20.50 times.
Wall Street's sentiment on the stock is bullish, with 21 of the 36 analysts covering the stock rating it ""buy"". The median price target on the stock is $81.00, up from $75.00 a month ago.

""They are becoming a halo brand,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>",China's ZTE shakes up board in bid for U.S. ban lift,"By Sue-Lin Wong and Sijia Jiang
SHENZHEN, China/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms giant ZTE Corp (HK:0763) announced a new board on Friday in a radical management shakeup as part of a $1.4 billion deal with the United States, moving it closer towards getting a devastating American supplier ban lifted.
The United States slapped the crippling seven-year supplier ban on ZTE, China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker, in April after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
The management overhaul was among the conditions laid out in the settlement deal to have the ban lifted. 
Li Zixue was elected as the company's new chairman, ZTE said in exchange filings late on Friday after its annual general meeting. 
Of the eight new board members, Li and Gu Junying were elected as executive directors, while non-executive directors include Li Buqing, Zhu Weimin and Fang Rong. The rest were independent non-executive directors, including Cai Manli, Yuming Bao and Gordon Ng. 
The old board and senior management, headed by Chairman Yin Yimin, have tendered their resignation on June 29, it added.
During the annual general meeting, shareholders also vetoed the company's proposal of profit distribution of paying 1.38 billion yuan ($208.66 million) worth of dividends.
The company, which ceased major operations after the ban, has also agreed to pay a $1 billion penalty and put $400 million in an escrow account as part of the deal to resume business with U.S. suppliers - who provide almost a third of the components used in its equipment. 
But the U.S. Department of Commerce has still not worked out the details necessary for lifting the ban, with the deal facing strong opposition from some U.S. lawmakers.
The uncertainty over the ban amid intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions has hammered ZTE shares, which have cratered 60 percent since trading resumed earlier this month following a two-month hiatus, wiping out more than $11 billion of the company's market valuation.
Some investors and analysts have questioned whether a brand new board and management team can settle in quickly enough and lead the company out of the woods. 
""I am most interested to see how well the new board will manage the company, as well as their technical expertise in telecoms. I don't know how experienced they are in both these respects,"" said a ZTE employee, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
NEW BOARD
ZTE's new chairman, 54-year-old Li, was the Communist Party secretary at a unit of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation - the largest state-owned shareholder of ZTE's parent Zhongxingxin, his biography shows. 
Cai Manli and Yuming Bao were also elected to the board. They were all nominated by Zhongxingxin, a state-owned entity which has a 30.34 percent stake in ZTE.
Apart from replacing its board, as part of its June 7 agreement with the United States, ZTE must also fire all leadership members at or above the senior vice president level, along with any executives or officers tied to the wrongdoing, and hire a U.S.-appointed compliance monitor within 30 days.
ZTE said in filings that shareholders approved board to apply for 30 billion yuan ($4.54 billion) credit line from Bank of China, as well as $6.0 billion credit line from China Development Bank.

(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on Friday extended the tender offer for its proposed $44 billion deal to buy  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI) for the 29th time as it awaits clearance from the Chinese government. 
Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (O:AAPL), will become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chip market if the deal goes through.
The biggest-ever deal in the semiconductor industry has faced hurdles from the onset, starting with the opposition from NXP shareholders who complained that Qualcomm's $110 per share offer undervalued the company.
The shareholders, which included hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, held out for more than a year since the offer was made in 2016. 
Qualcomm relented in February and raised its bid to $127.50 per share as a move to defend itself from a hostile $121 billion takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO).
Although the deal has been cleared by eight of the nine required global regulators, it now faces a new hurdle in the form of China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) amid rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. 
MOFCOM, however, has approved two smaller semiconductor deals involving American companies this year.
Qualcomm, which extended its tender offer every month last year, has now been doing it every week. 
On Friday it extended its cash tender offer to buy all of NXP shares to July 6 from June 29. 
The tender offer will continue to be extended until all conditions are satisfied or waived, or until the tender offer is terminated, Qualcomm said.

Shares of the company rose 1.1 percent to $56.52, while those of NXP fell marginally on Friday.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Softening U.S. secondary loan prices offer buying opportunity,"By Kristen Haunss and Yun Li
(LPC) - Threats of a global trade war and continuing geopolitical uncertainty are continuing to stoke wider market volatility, but are offering investors a chance to pick up loans at cheaper prices after months of sustained tightening.
The average bid for US loans in the secondary market dropped to 98.65 from a 2018 peak in late April of 99.01.
The percentage of loans trading above face value or par dropped to 25.9% on June 28 from nearly 60% on May 1. This is the lowest figure since September 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. 
Earlier this year, excess demand stemming from a record pace of Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) fund issuance and 19 weeks of inflows into loan mutual funds since February was supporting high secondary prices and helping companies to cut their borrowing costs by repricing loans. 
But the lower coupons are weighing on some investors’ portfolios, and managers have begun to push back on some of the market’s more aggressive requests. 
At least 13 companies flexed their pricing higher in June, including logistics company Savage Enterprises, which increased pricing on Thursday on a US$1.1bn term loan backing its acquisition of agribusiness Bartlett to 450bp from original guidance of 325bp-350bp, a source said. In May, 26 companies tightened pricing, according to LPC data.
This change in market sentiment has caused the secondary market to trade lower, offering some buyers the ability to pick up credits at a discount.
“Things are a little weaker,” said Joyce DeLucca, a portfolio manager at Hayfin Capital Management. 
“The increased new-issue supply has put some pressure on secondary levels and is providing managers some relief [offering buying opportunities] with a higher percentage of loans trading at or below par.”
Companies use the loan market to finance acquisitions and operations and pay a set coupon over Libor, which means lenders’ returns increase as interest rates rise. The three-month reference rate has risen more than 136% in the last 18 months, which is making the asset class an attractive hedge against rising interest rates. 
An influx of investor capital seeking floating-rate debt pushed US institutional loan issuance to US$362bn until the end of May, just below volume during the same period in 2017, which was a record year, according to LPC data. 
The US leveraged loan market now has US$1.22trn of loans outstanding, surpassing the US$1.21trn high-yield bond market for the first time since the financial crisis, according to Fitch Ratings. But there are signs of fatigue.
The SMi100, an index that tracks the 100 most widely held US loans, fell to 98.31 on June 28 from 98.66 on March 1. The LPC Top 40 Leveraged EMEA index fell to 98.53 from 99.88 during the same period.
Fears of a global trade war rattled the market after the US announced tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, President Donald Trump said the government was completing a study on increasing tariffs on cars from the European Union and has threatened to impose tariffs on a number of Chinese imports.
“A potential for a trade war with China has roiled the markets recently,” said John Fraser, head of Investcorp Credit Management US, who also noted Middle East tensions and uncertainty over the UK’s exit from the European Union. “This has created increased volatility in our marketplace.”
OPPORTUNISTIC OWICS
Opportunistic repricings have faced some pushback from investors in the primary market and some deals have even been withdrawn. As coupons ground tighter, some investors including CLOs struggled to buy loans priced at 175bp over Libor, which made it difficult to pay their own fund investors.
Companies with low-priced loans that were able to cut their borrowing costs are now being punished in the secondary market. American Airlines dropped pricing to 175bp on a US$1.825bn term loan in May, but the loan was quoted in the secondary market at 98.625-99 on June 26, below its issue price of 99.625.
Volatility is good news for investors who have been waiting to pick up credits at cheaper prices, sources said. At least one trader said that activity was strong this week, but some investors said there is room for secondary prices to fall further. 
At least four auctions have been held in the last two weeks to allow firms to buy loans quickly. Two Offers Wanted in Competitions (OWIC) for at least US$230m of loans were held this week after two auctions to buy more than US$270m of loans were held last week, three sources said. 
An OWIC is a list of loans that buyers are seeking to purchase, which is sent to investors who decide if they want to sell some of the requested loans and at what price.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Oasis raises heat on Britain's Premier Foods over 'weak' brands,"By Sangameswaran S and Simon Jessop
(Reuters) - Activist investor Oasis Management stepped up its campaign against Premier Foods' (L:PFD) management on Friday, questioning the board's culture after its chairman Keith Hamill called some of its British brands ""weak cards"".
 Premier Foods  has been under pressure to improve its performance since rejecting a 2016 takeover bid from U.S. food-maker McCormick (N:MKC) and Hong Kong-based Oasis is battling to remove Chief Executive Gavin Darby.
Oasis, Premier's second-largest shareholder, has engineered a showdown at the firm's annual general meeting next month by calling for shareholders to vote against Darby's re-election.
Founded in 2002 by Seth Fischer, who leads the firm as its chief investment officer, Oasis said it was ""extraordinary and unprecedented"" that Hamill, in comments reported this week by the Financial Times, described some of its brands, which include Mr Kipling cakes and Angel Delight, as ""weak cards"". 
Oasis also criticized Hamill's defense of the board's strategy and executive pay. 
Premier Foods is one of several European companies which have been targeted by activist investors, including Akzo Nobel,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and  Whitbread  (LON:WTB).
""Oasis considers the brands within Premier Foods to be exceedingly high quality and very valuable. Rather more 'gems' than 'weak cards', but gems that seem to be being mis-managed,"" it said in a statement, adding that sales of Batchelors Soup, for example, were growing at 11 percent a year.
A Premier spokesman said that the board remained unanimous that Darby was the best person to implement its agreed strategy, which he said ""is clearly working"". 
The spokesman said he believed Nissin (T:9066), Premier Food's biggest shareholder, backed Darby for re-election but noted it was a question for them. The Japanese noodle maker has declined to comment in the past and was not immediately available outside of Japanese business hours.
MOUNTING PRESSURE
Oasis holds a 9.3 percent stake in Premier Foods, which has been reeling under debt which it managed to cut by more than 5 percent to 496 million pounds this year.
Hamill challenged Oasis to come up with a new strategy, which Oasis said made it look like the board had ""given up"".
Rejecting Hamill's assertion that Darby had turned Premier into a well-run and efficient company, Oasis said it was rather in a ""zombie-like state"", with no credible growth strategy. 
Oasis also said the CEO's 8 million pound reward over the last five years ""totally unacceptable"". Under Darby's leadership, Premier's share price has slid by more than a third.
The Premier spokesman noted that Darby's pay had not increased since he joined. 
Premier Food's full-year sales growth of 3.6 percent was largely fueled by its international performance and sales of its top-performing Nissin-partnered Batchelor brand. 

The company said last year it was exploring options as part of a regular review into maximizing shareholder value. Darby also played down reports that it was looking to sell its Batchelors brand to Nissin as a part of this.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) investors took a largely long view on its failure in this year's U.S. stress tests, with its shares recovering on Friday from a record low hit earlier this week.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said the U.S. Federal Reserve's issues with Deutsche Bank were ""long standing"" and ""not new"", while UBS said the failure was ""not a total surprise.""
The Fed last year classified Deutsche Bank's U.S. unit as troubled and Deutsche Bank's shares had been falling in anticipation of the stress test verdict on Thursday.
Shares in the German bank, which are down 42 percent this year, were up 1.4 percent at 9.19 euros at 1401 GMT, above Wednesday's record low of 8.76 euros.
The test was the second stage in the Fed's annual health check of banks. Deutsche Bank passed the first phase last week, but was the only lender to fail the second, in another blow to its fragile reputation as it struggles to revive profitability.
The Fed, which regularly checks banks' financial strength, cited ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning controls. 
""It does seems like Deutsche Bank at the moment is the worst student in the class that can't get anything right,"" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas.
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said the bank was making ""good progress"" on improving.
""We are completely committed to work with authorities to get that even better ... over the next year,"" Sewing said in an interview on CNBC on Friday.
The bank said on Thursday it had made significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities, controls and infrastructure at its U.S. subsidiary.
The European Central Bank, which oversees Deutsche Bank, and German financial market watchdog BaFin both declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank will now need to obtain the Fed's permission before making capital payouts to its German parent. 
But the overall impact will be limited, Marenzi said. The bank may need to invest just about $10 million in additional stress testing technology and external consultants. 
Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, said the Fed's assessment could spook clients in the United States just as the bank tries to regain its footing there after announcing deep cuts in its U.S. and Asian operations. 
""The U.S. plays a major role for their investment banking revenues and if the U.S. doesn’t deliver the results they are expecting, what else does compensate for this? That is really a concern,"" Huenseler said.
Analysts at UBS said that, while expected, the Fed's results are ""an unwelcome outcome as it adds to weak sentiment and we think various stakeholders such as clients/counterparts could raise concerns.""
The Fed's assessment follows months of turmoil at Deutsche, which abruptly reshuffled management in April after three consecutive years of losses. It then began plans to scale back its investment bank to refocus on Europe and its home market.

It has flagged cuts to U.S. bond trading, equities and the business that serves hedge funds.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",How emerging markets became submerging markets in first half,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets have seen a brutal first half of the year, with stocks down almost 8 percent, swathes of currencies and bonds hit by a rampant dollar, and escalating trade tensions taking their toll. 
Yet given the underlying solid fundamentals across emerging markets, fund managers say this could be just a temporary shakeout - provided the surge in the dollar subsides. 
Argentina and Turkey have put the largest dents in portfolios as their currencies have fallen 30 percent and 17 percent respectively. But few others were spared in the widespread bloodletting.
MSCI's widely-tracked emerging market equities index (MSCIEF) is down almost 8 percent this year, while global equities are flat year-to-date (MIWO00000PUS). 
Local currency emerging market bonds have fallen 6 percent and dollar-denominated emerging debt <.JPMEGDR> is down 5 percent in the first half, after returning 14.2 percent and 9 percent respectively for the whole of 2017.
(GRAPHIC: Emerging market stocks tank 10 percent in H1 - https://reut.rs/2Ky0MAy) 
(Chart data to June 28; EM stocks rebounded on June 29) 
""U.S. rate hikes, a stronger dollar, the rise of the oil price and the increased trade fears created a cocktail where capital was less willing to stay in emerging assets,"" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment officer at NN Investment Partners, which has some 240 billion euros in assets. 
""For now, this is not something that we expect to be really the start of a sustained downshift in emerging markets growth or a sustained sell off in emerging market assets,"" he said. 
Emerging equity funds are still in positive territory year-to-date, with net inflows of $50.2 billion, according to data from research house EPFR Global, ahead of the $42.3 billion invested in the first half of 2017.
But pain has been taken on the debt side, with some $9.42 billion pulled from emerging market bond funds in the year to June 25, compared with net inflows of $43.9 billion in the first half of 2017.
Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, said all eyes were on the dollar's next move. 
""The recovery can happen more quickly than in 2013 and 2014 as the underlying fundamentals of EM are stronger. But the noise on trade wars and upside pressure on the dollar need to stabilize for those fundamentals to reassert themselves."" 
(GRAPHIC: EM bonds H1 2018 performance - https://reut.rs/2tEiNqr)
Pressure started mounting when U.S. President Donald Trump launched concrete plans for tariffs against imports from China and other major trading partners, prompting a swift response and fuelling worries a potential trade war would crimp global economic growth. 
A hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve has added to the strains, with the dollar index (DXY) pushing to an 11-month high and 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) topping 3 percent for the first time in seven years in May. 
The latter prompted a wave of selling, hitting Turkey and Argentina, two countries with high external borrowing requirements, the hardest. Central banks in both countries were forced into hefty emergency rate hikes to prop up their freefalling currencies. Argentina also sought IMF help. 
Turkish stocks (XU100) <.dMITR00000PUS> are down some 32 percent year-to-date in dollar terms - the worst performer across the main MSCI 24-country emerging markets index. 
(GRAPHIC: EM stocks H1 2018 performance - https://reut.rs/2tDschX) 
The Philippines (PSI) <.MIPH00000PUS> saw equities plunge some 24 percent as the peso tumbled to a 12-year low, with foreign investors pulling about $1.2 billion in shares from February 1 to June 20. 
South African stocks (JTOPI) also lost about a fifth of their value, battered by poor economic data and concern over power outages following wage protests at national electricity provider Eskom. The Brazilian (BVSP) and Indonesian indexes (JKSE) matched those falls.
And there was little solace to be found in currencies. Aside from the falls in Turkey's lira  and Argentina's peso , the Brazilian real  tumbled almost 14 percent and South Africa's rand  some 11 percent.
(GRAPHIC: EM FX H1 performance - https://reut.rs/2NaEzu7) 
""The dollar's roughly 5-percent gain since late January has triggered a bloodbath in emerging markets, led by Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa,"" said Jan Bopp, an investment strategist at J Safra Sarasin, adding that the overvalued lira and peso had been ""screaming shorts"" at that time.

Turkey is set to stay in the spotlight after elections delivered a victory for President Tayyip Erdogan. Investors are waiting to see what impact the self-styled ""enemy of interest rates"" could have on monetary policy and how much reform progress will be made.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",Blackstone selling two jumbo loans for F&R buyout,"By Yun Li and Michelle Sierra
LONDON (LPC) - Selldown of the jumbo $13.5 billion financing backing Blackstone Group’s (N:BX) $20 billion acquisition of a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters’ (TO:TRI) Financial and Risk unit is under way, banking sources said on Friday. 
A $8 billion-equivalent Term Loan B is being shown to large institutional investors before an expected September launch, and a $5.5 billion bridge loan to high-yield bond issues has also been launched. 
The deal is still awaiting regulatory clearance, and is expected to close between early August and early October, a person familiar with the situation said.
The $13.5 billion financing is being led by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). BAML is leading the loan and JP Morgan is leading the bonds.
The deal is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis, and its launch has been eagerly awaited since the deal was underwritten in January.
The Term Loan B is being pre-marketed and is expected to formally launch soon after Labor Day, which will be celebrated on September 3 in the US.
“It’s a huge deal, they [banks] are trying to gauge interest,” a source close to the transaction said.
The high-yield bonds are expected to launch between early August and early September, and will not be funded into an escrow account. 
The loans are more flexible and are being launched now as investors will earn a commitment fee on the bridge loan and a ticking fee on the Term Loan B before the deal closes, the person familiar with the situation said.
SOFTER MARKET
Blackstone announced on January 30 that it was buying a 55 percent majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR, after working on the deal for five years.
The private equity firm was able to command favorable financing terms when the deal was underwritten in January, but the leveraged finance market has softened in the past six months, which makes placing a jumbo buyout financing more challenging.
“It was underwritten in a different time, but I think this is no worry in terms of getting it done, it’s a timing issue. It's comfortable risk,” a person familiar with the situation said.
The TLB includes step-ups in market flex terms and the bond has debt caps, which are designed to give banks additional protection as investor opposition to aggressively priced and structured deals grows.
“They have got some accounts to look at it already, trying to get some feedback on the structure,” a loan trader said.
The huge Term Loan B will also have to compete with other large US buyout financings that are expected to launch after Labor Day, including the $9.9 billion buyout of Envision Healthcare (N:EVHC).
“In our opinion, this is a best in class LBO. There is no better sponsor than Blackstone and the business is as good as it gets,” the person said.
Blackstone declined to comment. JP Morgan and BAML declined to comment. Citigroup did not immediately return a request for comment.
DEAL STRUCTURE
The Term Loan B is split between $5.5 billion and $2.5 billion-equivalent in euros. The company will also place a $750 million revolving credit facility.
The financing also includes $3 billion-equivalent of secured bonds, split between $2 billion and $1 billion-equivalent in euros, and $2.5 billion-equivalent of unsecured bonds, split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent in euros. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Royal Bank of Canada and SMBC have joined the deal as joint lead arrangers.
Other banks that are expected to join the deal include MUFG, Mizuho,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), Natixis, BMO, Toronto-Dominion, UniCredit,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), ING and Jefferies.
The $5.5 billion bridge loan comprises a $3 billion 7.5-year senior secured loan, split between $2 billion and$1 billion-equivalent in euros, and an eight-year $2.5 billion unsecured loan, split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent in euros.
The structure mirrors the expected sizes of the bond tranches. The senior secured tranche pays a margin of 400bp and the unsecured tranche has a margin of 625bp.
A 50bp commitment fee is included for tickets of at least $150 million on the secured tranche and 25bp for all other ticket sizes. The unsecured tranche has a 75bp commitment fee for tickets of at least $50 million and 50bp for all other commitments.
Commitments are due on July 9.
Additional funding for the acquisition comes from $1 billion in preferred equity – with a 14.5 percent payment-in-kind coupon – $3 billion of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and $2.5 billion of existing equity, based on the $20 billion valuation, that will be rolled over.
Leverage is expected to be around 4.5 times through the secured debt and 5.6 times total debt after Ebitda adjustments, which could be as much as 30 percent, as the transaction is a carve-out and involves reallocating costs.

The size of the debt and leverage imply Ebitda of about $2.4 billion, including around $650 million of cost savings, based on the last 12 months’ Ebitda of about $1.7 billion for the F&R unit.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Angola plans rough diamond sale revamp to draw investment,"By Stephen Eisenhammer
LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola plans a new system for selling rough diamonds as part of President João Lourenço's efforts to increase investment, production and government revenue, a draft decree shows.
Diamond producers say they have struggled to make money in Angola due to a marketing system that obliged them to sell at below international prices, leading them to largely shun one of the world's most exciting prospects for the precious stones.
The draft presidential decree, which was seen by Reuters but could still be altered, includes a plan to set the price of rough diamonds against an international benchmark and give producers greater influence to pick their own buyers.
Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest economy is trying to diversify away from oil and the decree said there was a ""considerable difference between the country's potential and the (diamond) industry's actual impact on the national economy"".
Angola's Presidency and the Ministry for Natural Resources and Oil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month Reuters reported that Angola's largest diamond mine – Catoca - estimates it lost $464 million over the past six years by having to sell through state-owned diamond trading company Sodiam which often chose politically connected buyers able to negotiate prices below fair value.
The new legislation looks to fix this by allowing producers like Catoca to sell up to 60 percent of their production to companies of their choosing, including to their own trading divisions, breaking Sodiam's total control to select buyers. 
In another significant change, the new system will price stones according to a benchmark based on a sample of typical nationally-produced stones, along with an evaluation using a price list ""in line with the international market"".
Angola will also introduce sales sessions for pre-approved diamond buyers, along the lines of ""sights"" held by diamond group De Beers, while particularly rare stones will be individually sold via auction.
The planned legislation also foresees stricter oversight by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Oil, previously kept at arm's length by Sodiam and its parent Endiama, which had great influence under previous president José Eduardo dos Santos.

The Ministry will, according to the draft decree, have the power to appoint independent evaluators to intervene in any disputes and set more transparent criteria by which Sodiam selects buyers, giving priority to polishers and jewelry makers over middlemen that just resell the stones.

PARIS (Reuters) - French and Swiss banks owned by two branches of the Rothschild dynasty agreed on Friday to end a years-long dispute over the family name by promising that neither would ever call itself just ""Rothschild"".
In 2015, Swiss-listed bank Edmond de Rothschild Group, now headed by the late Edmond's son Benjamin and his wife Ariane, took legal action against Paris-based Rothschild & Co, headed by Benjamin's nephew Alexandre.
Benjamin and Ariane accused their relatives of causing confusion by using the Rothschild name as a standalone brand, saying that potentially infringed on other family members.
In the settlement reached on Friday, the two sides agreed to always use other distinctive elements alongside the family name to identify themselves. 
""Neither group may use the name Rothschild on its own in any form whatsoever in the future,"" the firms said in a joint statement.
Rothschild & Co will stop using the website domain, a company spokeswoman said. It will now use the name Rothschild Martin Maurel for private banking activities in France, Belgium and Monaco, while its French investment banking operation will still be called Rothschild & Co.
Use of the name is sensitive because some family members are concerned the creation of a consolidated Rothschild brand could potentially lead to its sale to an outside buyer, limiting the ability of future generations to benefit from it.
Founded by Mayer Amschel Rothschild in the 18th century, the dynasty has worked on some of history's biggest deals, including helping finance Britain's war against Napoleon's France.
The agreement brings to an end the litigation and seals a reconciliation between the cousins. ""The two groups have also agreed to work together to protect the family name in the banking sector,"" the joint statement said.
As part of the deal, both firms decided to unwind stakes they own in each other. That will result in Rothschild & Co paying 75 million euros ($87.38 million) in cash to Edmond de Rothschild, the companies said. 
The transaction will result in a degradation of Rothschild & Co's capital adequacy ratio by a little more than one percentage point to 17.3 percent, while Edmond de Rothschild's adequacy ratio will rise by 0.6 percentage points to 28.4 percent.

(Reuters) - U.S. fund managers in June replicated defensive recommendations from the previous month with slightly more cash, a Reuters poll showed, underscoring worries that a U.S. trade conflict with China and some of its own allies will hurt global growth.
With no let-up in the U.S. administration's protectionist campaign, stock markets, and particularly emerging markets, are in retreat, causing bond yields to fall despite the Federal Reserve's intention to keep raising interest rates.
Reuters' monthly survey of 12 U.S.-based money managers with a total of over $1.3 trillion assets under management found that long-term investors share those concerns.
Global equity allocations accounted for an average 56.7 percent of the model portfolio, down from 56.9 percent in the previous month, which was the lowest since October. Bond allocations came in at 35.9 percent, nudging up from the over two-year high of 35.8 percent in May.
The only notable change in the poll was an increase in cash holdings to the highest in over a year, 3.5 percent, up from 3.2 percent the month before.
""The risk of a full-scale trade war is real and is dangerously close to delivering a significant supply shock to not just the domestic economy but also globally,"" said a fund manager at a large U.S. investment firm. ""So, best to build on cash and be ready to buy into cyclical rallies.""
That shift in favor of safe-haven bets by fund managers are similar to findings of separate Reuters polls of equity strategists and fixed-income experts on the outlook for stocks and bonds markets.
But some fund managers also argued expectations for solid domestic economic performance this year will keep their preference for equities intact.
""We believe the facts of a healthy economy and strong earnings growth justify a bias in favor of equities and away from bonds. However, less accommodative central bank policies and the potential for a trade war are tangible threats to an otherwise positive outlook,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
""Caution, not fear, is warranted,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London [SOLYD.UL] Chief Executive Inga Beale, the commercial insurance market's first female CEO, will leave next year, Lloyd's said on Friday.
Beale's departure from the centuries old insurance market comes amid concerns that despite a modernization drive it is losing ground to rival centers such as Singapore and failing to stem losses. 
The exact date of her departure has not yet been set but the search for her successor is already underway, Lloyd's said in a statement, following an earlier report in The Insurance Insider.
""Leading Lloyd's is an honor and I am proud to have played a part in ensuring that it remains relevant and fit for purpose for the future,"" Beale said in the statement.
Lloyd's of London, which started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688, focuses on specialized insurance risks, from oil rigs to footballers' legs.
Beale was appointed chief executive in January 2014 and has led a push for a more diverse workforce in the market, which is made up of more than 80 insurance syndicates.
Beale has also encouraged a move to electronic processing, with plans to ditch most paper trades by the end of next year. Insurance staff traditionally carry their documentation around the 14-storey Lloyd's building in the City of London in briefcases or even suitcases.
""Her boldness and persistence have generated the momentum required to bring about real change,"" Bruce Carnegie-Brown, who became chairman last year, said in the statement. 
Lloyd's is reviewing costs after a series of natural catastrophes drove it to a 2 billion pound ($2.63 billion) loss last year, and is asking syndicates to provide action plans for their least profitable areas of business.
A report last year showed the London insurance and reinsurance markets were losing out to other centers such as Bermuda and Singapore.
""(Beale) has tried to push through change and more transparency with the new platforms and has come up against resistance from traditional segments of the market,"" said one financial services source. 
""There is a real need for change, given the threats from other places to London's position.""
An insurance source said he hoped that Lloyd's would appoint ""another imaginative and ideally female CEO - but it will probably be another bloke with braces"".

An official signing ceremony will take place at a summit in Berlin with China's Premier Li Keqiang on July 9, two of the sources said.
CATL will produce lithium-ion cells at the plant for use by German carmakers in battery packs for electric cars.
""The location of Thuringia... is correct,"" the third source said.
Global and local automakers are bolstering their electric vehicle capabilities and China, the world's largest car market, has emerged as a leading player due to a government push to encourage zero-emission vehicles.
German automakers, shaken by a diesel-emissions cheating scandal, are also pouring cash into electric vehicles and have grown reliant on a raft of Asian suppliers as they raise production.
CATL is China's dominant battery maker. BMW rival VW (DE:VOWG_p) recently picked CATL, and South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) and LG Chem (KS:051910) to deliver $25 billion worth of batteries.
This month Tesla's (O:TSLA) chief executive said he favors Germany as the location for the carmaker's first European battery factory. [nL4N1TM3FG]
BMW confirmed on Thursday that the carmaker had awarded a contract worth just over 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion) to CATL so the Chinese battery maker can build a factory to make cells for electric cars in Europe. 
Thuringia's Economy Ministry on Friday said it was negotiating with CATL about locating production in Thuringia.
""As far as we know, several locations across Europe are being considered for such an investment. These discussions have not been concluded,"" it said.
Local newspaper Thueringer Allgemeine said the investment may be made in the eastern German city of Erfurt, on the same site as a solar cell plant operated by Solarworld, a company which was deemed insolvent in March.
CATL declined to comment. 
The Chancellor's office in Berlin had no immediate comment. Germany's Economy Ministry said it was not involved in a decision to attract an investment from CATL.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",China says U.S. should tell airlines to change websites in Taiwan row,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday that the United States should tell its airlines to change their websites to refer to self-ruled Taiwan as Chinese territory, after the United States said China had rejected requests for talks on the matter.
China has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, begin referring to Taiwan as Chinese territory on their websites, along with Hong Kong and Macau, a move described by the White House in May as ""Orwellian nonsense"".
Numerous non-U.S. carriers, such as  Air Canada  (TO:AC), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and British Airways (L:ICAG) have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters checks.
But several U.S. companies, including Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (N:UAL), were among carriers that sought extensions to a May 25 deadline to make the changes. The final deadline is July 25.
Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said it was the broad consensus in the international community that there was only one China and that Taiwan was part of it, and that this was not up for negotiation.
Foreign companies operating in China must respect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the feelings of the Chinese people, he added.
""I again stress, the 'one China' principle is the political basis of Sino-U.S. ties, and brooks no negotiations or consultations,"" Lu said.
""The U.S. government should urge the relevant companies to scrupulously abide by the one China principle and rectify their websites as soon as possible.""
China has rejected U.S. requests for talks over how American airlines and their websites refer to Taiwan, according to sources, adding to tensions in a relationship already frayed by a major trade dispute.
The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging that China takes the position that there is one China and Taiwan is part of it. But the United States is also Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier.

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years until 1997, and neighboring Macau, administered by Portugal for centuries until 1999, are part of China but are run largely autonomously.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>","Global funds cut stocks to 11-month lows, eye trade war risk: Reuters poll","By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors cut equities to 11-month lows in June and raised cash levels as the U.S. ratcheted up trade tensions, but a majority of Reuters poll participants still expect world stocks to end 2018 higher after a volatile first half. 
The monthly asset-allocation survey of 49 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out June 18-29.
During this period the U.S. administration escalated its ongoing trade dispute with the U.S.'s key trading partners, sending global equities into a tailspin.
Also in June, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year and the European Central Bank signaled it would conclude its bond-buying by the end of the year. 
The poll showed investors took risk off the table, cutting their global equity holdings to 46.8 percent, the lowest in almost a year and down 3.3 percentage points since January. Cash levels rose from 4.8 percent to 5.4 percent, the highest since March 2017.
""All year we have been warning that 2018 will be a battle between profits and politics,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
On the one hand, the upswing in the global economy provided a favorable backdrop for double-digit corporate profits growth, he said. 
""On the other hand, the recent warnings from President Trump about widening the U.S.'s trade concerns from steel and aluminum into cars and IT are dragging on investor sentiment and could lead to a noticeable shock to business activity.""
Despite these misgivings, 89 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the outlook for global equities expected the MSCI all-country world index to end the year higher.
The index is flat at the halfway mark, but Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth, expects it to end the year up 5 to 10 percent, with buyers returning in the fourth quarter after a range-bound summer. 
""The economic fundamentals are highly supportive of risk assets such as equities and commodities,"" he said, adding that although the ""white noise"" from President Donald Trump's administration had increased volatility across financial markets, it had not changed the underlying strength of the economy or consumer behavior.
But investors remained concerned about the impact on emerging markets. The worry is that U.S. tariffs levied on imported goods from China, Europe and elsewhere will disrupt global supply chains and stymie economic growth. 
Emerging stocks fell (MSCIEF) almost 5 percent in June, extending year-to-date losses to 8 percent. In the poll, investors trimmed their emerging equity exposure slightly to 12.4 percent, but rolled back emerging bonds by 1.3 percentage points to 9.7 percent.
This followed a turbulent May in which the Turkish lira  and Argentine peso  came under intense selling pressure. The selling spread to other emerging-market currencies in June as the dollar index (DXY) climbed to an 11-month high. 
DOLLAR SURGE
And 63 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the U.S. dollar's surge against emerging market currencies said it had further to run.
Salman Baig, an investment manager at Unigestion, cited political risks, such as upcoming elections in Mexico and Brazil, and the tightening Fed as reasons to be wary.
""A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated EM debts more expensive for local borrowers, thereby causing investors to demand higher premiums for bearing this risk,"" he said. ""It also seems many EM countries are not in much better shape than they were during the 2013 tantrum.""
John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust, was among the 30 percent who expected the dollar surge to peter out. 
""(It) was justified by the perception of weaker relative growth outside the U.S., helped no doubt by tax cuts,"" he said. ""As we go further into the year, this is likely to unwind as other economies seem ready for catch up."" 
Investors showed a preference for U.S. stocks, raising them 1 percentage point to 39.6 percent, the highest since January, and cutting eurozone equities to 19.2 percent, the lowest since December. 
They also raised U.S. bond holdings to 39.2 percent, the highest since May 2017, and cut eurozone bonds to 28.2 percent, the lowest in a year.
CLOSE CALL
In June, the ECB said interest rates would stay unchanged at least through next summer, wording that pushed back rate hike expectations by three months to September 2019. 
But poll participants were pretty evenly split over whether the ECB would raise rates before President Mario Draghi leaves office in October 2019, with 59 percent saying it would. 
""I suspect he will raise rates once, just before his departure, in an almost symbolic move to show that the era of negative rates is over,"" said Rob Pemberton, investment director at HFMC Wealth.
But others argued it was a close call, with Michael Ingram, chief market strategist, WHIreland Wealth Management, saying the ECB had given themselves ""wriggle room"".
""Given weakening economic momentum, downside risks to the outlook via trade and geopolitical risk and the current glacial progress to hitting the ECB's inflation target ... the odds are rates will remain at current levels for an even longer period,"" he said.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Halfway into 2018, wary European funds cut equities to 19-month low: Reuters poll","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Halfway through 2018, trade tension and concern about economic growth have turned European fund managers wary on equities, with allocations falling to 19-month lows and investors especially worried about the outlook for Europe and emerging markets.
The latest Reuters asset-allocation survey, conducted June 18-28, came as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year and the European Central Bank signaled its bond-buying would conclude by the end of the year.
At the same time, world markets have been convulsed by trade tensions between China and the United States, with threats of tit-for-tat tariffs that risk tipping the world economy into recession and slashing corporate profitability. 
That has knocked world shares 9 percent off their highs at the end of January, leaving a decade-long equity bull market increasingly fragile.
""We have entered a phase of diminishing returns across the board,"" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi. ""Our narrative of a mature financial cycle and peaking economic growth is confirmed and protectionist talks expose the scenario to downside risk.""
Equity holdings in European portfolios fell 1.7 percent to 40 percent, the lowest since November 2016. Cash rose to 8.5 percent, the highest since November 2016, up 2 percentage points from last month. 
Equity allocations are down six percentage points since January, according to the poll, which had 15 participants in June.
However, investors are reluctant to turn their back on equities altogether. Asked whether MSCI's all-country equity index would end 2018 higher than it is now, more than 90 percent answered in the affirmative.
They are more keen on U.S. equities, noting the greater weight of technology shares in the index and tax cuts that will cushion the market, at least in the short term. The U.S. share in equity portfolios rose to 41.6 percent, the highest since October 2014. 
""The positive corporate earnings momentum has remained intact and will sustain equity returns to the end of the year, even in an environment of decelerating economic expansion,"" Robeco strategist Peter van der Welle said.
But euro zone stocks fell 5 percentage points to 25.7 percent, the lowest since the end of 2012, possibly on signs of stuttering growth.
Fixed income allocations, meanwhile, slipped to an average 41.2 percent from May's 43 percent.
But signs of stalling European growth and the trade fears mean bond yields have struggled to rise, and European politics are tense, amid discord over migration and worries about the new Italian government's policies.
All that has forced the ECB to push the timing for its first rate rise this cycle to the end of next summer, later than expected, making it possible President Mario Draghi will finish his term next October without ever raising rates.
Just over half of poll participants who answered an extra question on the subject expect Draghi to raise rates before he steps down. But Jan Bopp, an investment strategist at J Safra Sarasin disagreed, noting this month's ultra-dovish forward guidance from the bank. 
""Everything points toward a slower exit/unwind from what the market is pricing in. The ECB will likely push rate hikes until at least the end of Draghi's term. Draghi could therefore end his term without one rate hike,"" he said. 
The other big story is the emerging-market sell off, as Fed policy tightening sends the dollar higher. 
The June poll showed European funds had cut holdings of emerging equities and debt across all regions. Two-thirds of those who answered a special question said the dollar's rally against emerging-market currencies likely had further to run.
""In some countries ... it will be difficult to avoid a sharp recession of domestic demand to curb the external imbalances. But a recession will trigger fears of insolvency amongst banks, which could lead to domestic capital outflows and a second leg of currency depreciation,"" said Raphael Gallardo, a strategist at Ostrum Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis.

1036,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Fed Test Slaps Wall Street Titans, Unleashes Record Payout","(Bloomberg) -- Tougher Federal Reserve stress tests forced some of Wall Street’s top banks to rein in ambitious plans for pumping out cash to shareholders. But even those diminished returns spell a record payout to investors.
As the central bank’s annual stress tests ended Thursday, the nation’s four largest lenders -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). -- said they will distribute more than $110 billion through dividends and stock buybacks, sending their stocks higher. Even shares of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) -- which the Fed blocked from boosting total payouts -- climbed in early trading Friday.
The Fed’s decisions in the test provided some relief for investors after a record 13 straight days of declines in the S&P 500 Financials Index. In the hours after clearing the test, more than 20 firms described how they’ll reward their owners over the coming four quarters. Wells Fargo plans to boost payouts more than 70 percent to about $33 billion, while JPMorgan signaled a 16 percent increase to $32 billion.
“Today is about the capital announcements, and what we’re seeing is dividends going up more than 30 percent on average,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining-Sparks IBG LP, as announcements were still rolling in. In addition, buybacks mean “share count is going to go down by about 6 to 7 percent,” boosting earnings per share, he said.
Wells Fargo rose 3.6 percent as of 7:02 a.m. in New York. JPMorgan and Citigroup both advanced at least 1.8 percent.
The Fed also delivered some bad news. The regulator said it rejected initial proposals from six firms -- JPMorgan, Goldman, Morgan Stanley,  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)., M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB). and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) -- to make even higher payouts, forcing them to temper their requests. Never have so many firms taken that so-called mulligan to finish the exam.
Goldman passed after agreeing to make payouts in line with the average of the past two years. Morgan Stanley maintained the level it paid in the past 12 months. Those plans could still leave them short of regulatory minimums in a severe crisis, the Fed projected. But the regulator let them proceed after considering the impact of one-time charges in the fourth quarter linked to U.S. tax cuts -- which are expected to boost future profits.
That leniency contrasted with past years, said David Wright, managing director of Deloitte & Touche LLP’s banking and securities regulatory practice.
“They felt they could provide some accommodation to a small number of firms,” he said. “I wouldn’t expect this to have happened a few years ago under different leadership at the supervisory agencies.”
The Fed also failed a U.S. subsidiary of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), citing “widespread and critical deficiencies” in its planning. The widely anticipated rejection limits the unit’s ability to send capital home to Germany and comes as senior executives try to bolster investor confidence. The Frankfurt-based firm said it’s working with regulators and making progress.
The Fed said  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s plan was approved on the condition that the company improves its methodology on calculating counterparty exposures under stressed scenarios. The New York-based bank said it “took a conservative approach.”
Altogether, firms will distribute about 95 percent of their profits, the Fed projected, roughly in line with analysts’ estimates. That means that despite their stumbles in the tests, big banks may deliver the $170 billion in combined payouts that Wall Street analysts had predicted for the coming 12 months -- about $30 billion more than in the previous four quarters.
Analysts had anticipated some firms would probably struggle. Several estimated Morgan Stanley would increase its payout only slightly and that Goldman Sachs would return less cash. Further hints of trouble emerged last week, when the pair barely passed the test’s first round, based on continuing payouts at past levels. Shares of both companies were little changed in late trading Thursday.
The Fed’s hypothetical scenarios were much harsher this year, including a 65 percent drop in stock prices and a U.S. economic contraction of as much as 8.9 percent. The worst point in tests for the past three years didn’t exceed 7.5 percent. The scenarios created bigger theoretical losses for firms that have large capital markets businesses. Goldman and Morgan Stanley’s earnings rely more on trading and wealth management than bigger rivals who also do consumer and commercial banking.
The Fed proposed major revisions to its exam program in April, which will probably be finalized later this year and go into effect with next year’s test. Banks will no longer fail the quantitative portion, and the hypothetical drop in their capital levels under stress will become a conservation buffer that will be incorporated into their ongoing minimum capital requirements. They can still fail the qualitative portion, which only 18 of the 35 firms being tested are subject to.

Nike also announced after Thursday’s close a four-year $15 billion buyback plan.
In other positive earnings news, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) jumped 8.6% in pre-market trading as the homebuilder reported quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
On the economic front, investors prepared for a slew of data to be released on Friday.
A regional U.S. manufacturing report, consumer sentiment data and crucial update on the Fed's preferred measure of inflation will round off this week's release of top-tier economic data on Friday.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index due 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – is expected to show 0.2% growth for May and 1.9% growth year-on-year, up slightly from 1.8% the prior month.
The PCE deflator data, a measure of inflation based on changes in personal consumption, will also be in focus after rising 2% in April.
The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) due 9:45AM ET (13:45GMT) is expected to show a reading of 60.1, down from a prior reading of 62.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion of the manufacturing sector; a reading below indicates contraction.
Michigan’s consumer sentiment index due 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT) is forecast to show a reading of 99.1 roughly unchanged from the previous month, while consumer expectations data will also be in focus.
Economic data so far this week has played second fiddle to trade-related headlines but a slowdown in U.S. economic growth reported Thursday weighed on sentiment somewhat.
While waiting for the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.43% to trade at 94.59 by 6:58AM ET (10:58GMT), paring weekly gains to just 0.4%."

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 06:17AM ET</span>",China's Xiaomi raises $4.72 billion after pricing HK IPO at bottom of range: sources,"By Fiona Lau and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters/IFR) - China's  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) priced its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) at the bottom of an indicative range, raising $4.72 billion in the world's biggest tech float in four years, people close to the transaction said on Friday.
That values the firm at about $54 billion, almost half the valuation industry insiders touted at the beginning of the year.
The pricing comes at a delicate time for Hong Kong's stock market, with the benchmark Hang Seng index falling 6.5 percent this month and 4.8 percent this year as investors fret over escalating trade tension between the United States and China.
As such, Xiaomi's share sale is widely seen as a test of market sentiment for what is expected to be a packed second-half of the year for Hong Kong IPOs, with offerings including online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform Meituan Dianping.
China Tower, the world's largest mobile mast operator, has won approval for a Hong Kong IPO that could raise up to $10 billion. However, its listing timing will depend somewhat on how well Xiaomi's deal is received, sources have told Reuters.
""Xiaomi's pricing won't be good news for market sentiment,"" said Hong Hao, chief strategist at BOCOM International. ""But other IPO candidates will still flock to the market to list before market conditions become more challenging.""
Xiaomi is selling about 2.18 billion shares at HK$17 each ($2.17), the bottom of a price range of HK$17 to HK$22, two of the people said. That makes the IPO the largest in the technology sector since  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) raised $25 billion in New York in 2014.
Xiaomi declined to comment. The people declined to be identified as the information was not public.
The HK$17 price represents a multiple of 39.6 times 2018 earnings and 22.7 times Xiaomi's 2019 earnings forecast by its underwriting syndicate. At present, rival Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is trading at 17 times trailing earnings and 14 times forward earnings, showed Thomson Reuters data.
""I'm not surprised at all by its pricing at the bottom,"" said Hong. ""It claims to be a hardware plus internet services company, but the majority of its revenues come from the smartphone business. It's still way more expensive than Apple on a price-earnings basis.""
Xiaomi's price values the firm at $53.9 billion before the exercise of a ""greenshoe"" or over-allotment option, whereby additional shares are sold depending on demand.
The valuation is far below the $100 billion touted by sources earlier this year as well as the more recent $70 billion-plus target that some analysts and investors saw as aggressive. Xiaomi was valued at $46 billion in its last fundraising in 2014. (https://reut.rs/2MAcScH)
Xiaomi's IPO adds to the $6 billion of new listings so far in 2018 in Hong Kong and is set to be the first under the city's new exchange rules permitting dual-class shares common in the tech industry in an attempt to attract tech floats.
It was initially expected to raise up to $10 billion, split between Hong Kong and mainland China, but last week shelved the mainland offering until after listing in Hong Kong. Cornerstone investors included U.S. chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and telecom service provider China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941).
Set up in 2010, Xiaomi doubled its smartphone shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in handset sales. It also makes internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers.
Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled Xiaomi is due to start trading in Hong Kong on July 9.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) branch manager rewarded with an island holiday for beating his sales target had tweaked the company's risk detection system to remove red flags attached to loans he had written, an inquiry heard on Friday.
The evidence about the manager, who the inquiry heard was sent to tropical Hayman Island for achieving 134 percent of his annual target and was hailed as one of the CEO's ""rural and regional champions"", highlights one of the main themes of the inquiry so far: the link between bonuses and inappropriate conduct in bank sales staff.
Now mid-way through its yearlong timetable, the so-called Royal Commission has heard accusations of widespread misconduct among Australia's major financial services companies, including charging fees for financial advice to people who have died and board-level deception of a regulator.
CBA, the country's biggest lender, is already under particular scrutiny because of a string of scandals outside the inquiry including accusations it used outdated medical definitions to deny health insurance customers payouts, and a federal lawsuit accusing it of failing to enact anti-money laundering protocols more than 50,000 times.
At the Royal Commission on Friday, the inquiry's main lawyer, Rowena Orr, read out a CBA document which said CBA's risk detection system found that from 2011 ""irregular and dishonour behaviors were not appropriately captured which reduced its effectiveness as an early warning system"".
Internal investigations indicated that ""the bank manager was using the behavior triggers function in Genesys to reset the dishonors to zero, thereby resulting in non-escalation,"" Orr said, reading the undated CBA document. Genesys is a customer support software system.
A day earlier, the inquiry heard the manager, whose name was not given, won his prize that year for writing A$33.5 million worth of loans with 60 new clients, compared to his A$25 million target. The bank had since stopped awarding the holiday prize.
The inquiry also heard the previous day that the branch manager got 57 percent of his base salary as a bonus for exceeding targets. The manager resigned in 2012.
Asked on Friday if changing the risk profile of loans on the software system amounted to misconduct, CBA executive general manager of personal and business banking Sinead Taylor said ""yes"".
Orr also attempted to establish whether CBA board member Harrison Young was aware of the branch manager's misconduct.
CBA's Taylor told the inquiry she did not know whether Young, who quit in 2017, was briefed about the branch manager's actions.
CBA declined to comment.

The hearing continues on Monday.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",UK stocks coverage shrinks after new research rules,"By Alasdair Pal
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of financial analysts tracking small companies fell during in the first half of 2018 as changes in European Union rules forced a shakeup in how banks charge for research - potentially clouding investor visibility in some areas. 
Under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), which went into effect on Jan. 3, fund managers are required to pay an explicit fee for research from banks they previously got for free.
The rule change made it more likely that fund managers would cut back on the amount of research they get. That in turn could force brokers to curb their coverage, particularly of smaller companies.
During the six months since MiFID II was introduced, Britain has seen one of the biggest drops in research coverage, Reuters data show. The median number of analysts covering a stock on MSCI's UK smaller companies index fell from nine to eight.
Italy was the only other country to see its median figure fall. Most others were unchanged over the period. 
The figures were similar for the FTSE All Share (FTAS) index, which includes larger companies on the blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) index. The median number of analysts per stock fell from 10 to nine and the mean fell from 10.8 to 10.1. 
The decline is in line with a broader trend of diminishing coverage. The average number of analysts covering the stocks on the FTSE All Share was down by around 30 percent since the beginning of 2014. 
Switzerland was the only major country where analyst coverage of its small-cap index improved, although it remains poorly covered compared with its peers.

CROWDED MARKET
Britain had the most coverage in January, with local brokers competing against global banks, a study by Reuters in January found.
But London-based Cenkos, for example, now covers around 150 companies, according to a source familiar with the company, down from 170 in December and 195 at the end of 2016, according to its annual report. In March, it reported revenues from its research division fell 41 percent to 2.9 million pounds in 2017. 
Cenkos did not respond to requests for comment. 
While coverage of companies fell, experts said there was little evidence of large amounts of analyst redundancies. 
""From a headcount perspective, we don’t see any reduction – in fact, marginally, we see an increase,"" said David Enticknap, the head of Extel, a firm that surveys and ranks more than 10,000 analysts covering European equities. 
""Most sell-side firms are waiting to see what the impact of MiFID will actually be rather than take a punt on it.""
Macquarie announced in May it would make some of its analysts redundant and focus its European equity research coverage on six key sectors. 
But other firms have added staff. German broker Berenberg has hired a dozen mid- and small-cap analysts since the beginning of the year, sensing an opportunity if rivals step back. 
""There seems to have been a bit of analyst movement in the first part of the year, and we have sensed some discontent (at other brokers),"" said Laura Janssens, Berenberg’s head of research.

""I am absolutely convinced that a major unintended consequence of MiFID will be less coverage for small and mid-cap companies.""

1046,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street Left Reeling as 2018 Upends Almost Every Bet,"(Bloomberg) -- The half that began with “melt-up” euphoria ended with melt-down fear.
Investors breezed into 2018 expecting to pick up easy returns from steadily rising asset prices. Instead, they’re nursing losses on bets that had delivered the biggest gains from a decade’s worth of buoyant liquidity.
Emerging economies began the year as a market darling only to be toppled by a surge in the dollar and rising political risks. A brewing trade war has dashed expectations synchronized global growth would keep pumping up equities. China, long seen as the world’s growth engine, slipped into a bear market.
The sea change stemmed more or less from the snap stock selloff of early February, which was blamed on traders unwinding huge short-volatility positions. Since then, markets have become more vulnerable to mounting political risks as investors caught unawares grow increasingly risk-averse.
“We’ve gone from an extreme of market psychology where all risks could be ignored to one that is hyper-sensitive,” said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. “The February turn, when equities suddenly started selling off, that was the moment when shock waves rippled across financial markets and people woke up to a different world.”
Developing-nation stocks are the biggest losers of the year so far, handing investors a loss of 6.8 percent as of Friday, once dividend payments have been taken into account. Emerging-market and euro-denominated debt are close runners-up, with losses of more than 4 percent. Oil was the standout winner as investors bet on tightening supply against the backdrop of the collapse of Venezuelan output and the increased isolation of Iran.
The turbulent first half may be just the beginning, as markets adjust to central banks paring stimulus that had propped up asset prices with liquidity and low rates for the past decade.
Anyone trying to gauge how markets will fare in the second half of the year may want to start with the outlook for the dollar. Athey pinpoints the ascendant greenback as the biggest contributor to the decline in global financial health this quarter. The options market suggests the U.S. currency’s reign will prevail in the next three months after notching its first quarterly gain since the end of 2016.
“Six months ago you had a lot of people with a high conviction that global growth would be spectacular in 2018,” said Max Kettner, a cross-asset strategist at Commerzbank in London. “Much of that had to do with two themes: global synchronized growth and a flat dollar. They both turned out to be completely wrong.”
The volte-face was captured in a Goldman Sachs barometer of risk appetite which slumped to an 11-month low in late June after signaling the most accommodative investment environment since 2000 in January.
Demand for price protection against large swings in major global equities and currencies is approaching its highest level since March this week, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch hedging skew index.
The market’s growth expectations are still too high as trade tensions rattle the world’s two biggest economies, creating ample room for more negative surprises in the next few months, according to Kettner. Emerging markets in particular need a “cross-correlated wash-out” before they will become attractive again, he said.
“It’s no longer an environment where you can just say, ‘I’m buying an ETF, see you in six months,”’ Kettner said.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 04:42AM ET</span>","World stocks jump on lull in trade tensions, euro gets summit boost","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks enjoyed a strong bounce on Friday as a recovery in Asian markets spread to European shares after a turbulent week of selling as investors' fears of higher barriers to trade came closer to becoming reality.
MSCI's index of world stocks rose 0.5 percent by 0800 GMT, its strongest gain in three weeks, but its second quarter was still set to be in the red as investors priced in U.S. tariffs that are set to be implemented next week.
The U.S. administration is due to activate tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion on July 6, which is expected to prompt a tit-for-tat response from Beijing.
European stocks rallied strongly, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.2 percent and Germany's trade-sensitive DAX up 1.5 percent. 
But trade wars have already mauled assets from the Chinese yuan to European autos stocks, and wiped $1.75 trillion off world stocks' market capitalization since June 12.
The euro jumped after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.5 percent to $1.1622 at 0800 GMT. 
""The outcome of the summit tells us something about the severity of the situation,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea in Helsinki.
""I'm not confident it will solve the underlying issues but there was a fear that the summit would fail and we could get a collapse of the German government, so that risk premium is being priced out,"" he said.
STOCKS GAIN, YUAN PAIN
While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade. 
The Chinese yuan traded as low as 6.6441 to the dollar on Friday, its lowest since November. It traded at 6.6211 to the dollar around 0800 GMT.
Chinese shares rebounded from two-year lows, helped by news that Beijing would ease foreign investment curbs on sectors including banking, automobiles, heavy industry and agriculture. 
But despite Friday's gains, the CSI300 and Shanghai Composite are the world's worst-performing major indexes this year.
In strong contrast to the yuan, the U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since Q4 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year.
The dollar index edged down 0.5 percent to 94.924, and was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 110.65. 
European bonds diverged, with the EU Summit migration agreement pushing Germany's Bund yields up while Italian 10-year government bond yields fell to a one-week low.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.8547 percent and the yield curve widened slightly to 33.3 basis points. 
Many investors see its flattening to record lows as a sign recession may be around the corner. 
Intensifying trade tariff fears contrasted with a still strong picture of the global economy and robust company earnings growth.
""Our view for this year has been that asset markets would likely underperform the real economy as peaking growth momentum, tighter financial conditions, higher inflation and more volatility would act as a drag on valuations even as EPS trends remain solid,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts, cutting their index targets for MSCI Europe on Thursday. 
Oil prices also came under pressure from trade frictions, falling despite tight crude market conditions that had pushed prices to three-and-a-half-year highs on Thursday. 
U.S. crude was 0.4 percent lower at $73.19 a barrel. Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $78.01 per barrel.
Gold remained near 6 1/2 month lows, weighed down by trade worries, interest rate expectations and the strong dollar.
Spot gold traded up 0.2 percent at $1250.78 per ounce, but was still headed for its worst monthly performance since November 2016. (GOL)

Emerging stocks jumped 1.6 percent, having hit a one-month low in the previous session. The index was set for its worst month since January 2016 as the rising dollar battered emerging economies.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",Novartis hands investors Alcon spin-off and $5 billion share buyback,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) plans to spin off its Alcon eye care business to shareholders and repurchase up to $5 billion in shares, as Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan refocuses the Swiss firm on prescription drugs.
Narasimhan, a Harvard-trained U.S. doctor, said on Friday it was premature to give a valuation for U.S.-based Alcon, which Novartis bought for $52 billion in 2011, although his predecessor Joe Jimenez once estimated it at $25-$35 billion.
Alcon, a hangover from the empire-building legacy of former Novartis boss Daniel Vasella, could be worth between $15 and $23 billion, Bank Vontobel analysts said, adding that its ongoing recovery would influence the final price.
Novartis had to make massive investments to reverse falling sales and losses at Alcon, although its revenue is again growing and it posted a $90 million first quarter operating profit. 
Novartis plans a shareholder meeting in February 2019 to seek approval for the spin-off, which is due to be completed in the first half of next year, while the share buyback is due to be completed by the end of next year.
Shares in Novartis were 2.9 percent higher at 0757 GMT as investors welcomed the Alcon separation and share buyback.
Narasimhan is pressing ahead with Jimenez's reversal of the decade-long expansion under Vasella, the former CEO and chairman. (https://reut.rs/2KvMKPK)
Since Vasella's departure in 2013, Novartis has exited vaccines, dumped its animal health business and earlier this year unloaded its consumer health joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) for around $13 billion.
""A company like ours needs to focus our capital in our area of strength which I believe is innovating world class medicines and I'd like to build our strength in digital and data technologies,"" Narasimhan told reporters on a conference call.
NARASIMHAN REFOCUSES 
Since last year, Novartis has bought U.S.-based Avexis for $8.7 billion and French-based Advanced Accelerator Applications for $3.9 billion, giving it a platform in both gene therapy and radiopharmaceuticals respectively.
Novartis has also been investing in digital technology, including a mobile app to collect eye disease data.
Alcon makes surgical equipment to treat cataracts and contact lenses, businesses that no longer fit Novartis's prescription drugs blueprint.
Novartis will retain its roughly $3.6 billion prescription eye drugs portfolio, which it previously moved from Alcon into its main pharma unit.
Narasimhan has opted to unload to business to shareholders, long the company's preferred option, after a review and Novartis will not keep any Alcon stock, he said.
A listing is slated for New York and Zurich, with Alcon's existing head, Mike Ball, set become its chairman, while David Endicott will become Alcon CEO.
The share buyback will be partially financed out of proceeds from the OTC sale to GSK, Narasimhan said.
The Alcon spin off is a welcome diversion from a political scandal in the United States triggered by Novartis paying $1.2 million in fees to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Narasimhan has called the payments a mistake, and the furor cost Novartis's top lawyer his job.

The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) had in May commissioned an inquiry into CBA's governance and culture, after the lender was sued by Australia's financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC for massive breaches of money laundering laws.
APRA had imposed an extra A$1 billion onto CBA's minimum capital requirements following the inquiry, prompting the lender to propose several remedial measures that have been approved by the banking regulator.
The bank said it would publicly report on the progress of its remedial action plan, which would be reviewed by independent reviewer Promontory Financial Group.
Australia's biggest lender said in January that its new CEO, Matt Comyn, would receive A$2.2 million in annual fixed pay, lower than that of predecessor Ian Narev. 
The bank has also faced intense scrutiny amid an ongoing inquiry into the country's financial sector that has revealed CBA wrongfully withdrew ""advice fees"" from dead people's accounts and mistakenly double charged interest to thousands of business customers.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport conducted a review of whether Jin Air, an affiliate of  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490), violated transport law by appointing a non-Korean - controlling family member Cho Hyun-min - as a board director.
Cho, 35, is a U.S. citizen and the youngest daughter of Korean Air Lines Co Ltd Chairman Cho Yang-ho. She stepped down as senior vice president at Jin Air in April after reports of inappropriate conduct at a business meeting prompted an outcry over the behavior of families running conglomerates.
""Worldwide, it is very rare that a license of a company is canceled. Also in our case, this will have a grave impact on the airline industry. There is controversy over the legality of cancellation as well,"" Vice Transport Minister Kim Jeong-ryeol said at a briefing.
He said the ministry will hold a hearing and listen to the views of stakeholders including employees, and that law firms and professors have expressed mixed opinions on the matter.
Jin Air in a statement said it will sincerely cooperate with the hearing where it will express its position.
It is South Korea's second-largest discount carrier after  Jeju Air Co Ltd  (KS:089590). It employs about 1,900 workers as well as over 10,000 subcontractors.
A workers' union at Korean Air said it will protest if Jin Air's license is canceled, which they said would threaten job security and the livelihood of workers.
Reflecting uncertainty of the airline's fate, shares of Jin Air ended down 0.4 percent on Friday whereas those of Korean Air rose 4.4 percent. The wider market (KS11) was 0.5 percent higher.
The public furore over Cho's behavior at the business meeting prompted investigations into several of her family members, including Chairman Cho who appeared at the prosecutor's office for questioning on Thursday.
Cho Hyun-min is a younger sister of Heather Cho who achieved global notoriety in the 2014 ""nut rage"" incident, when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class before takeoff from New York, eventually delaying the flight.
President Moon Jae-in has vowed to curb the power of family-owned conglomerates and improve their governance following a corruption scandal involving his impeached predecessor and business leaders including the chief of  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930).

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>","Chinese firm eyes 'strata-sales', high debt for flipping Hong Kong towers","By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese company plans to emulate a risky property strategy in Hong Kong that was used last year to buy a skyscraper from the tycoon Li Ka-shing, taking on a high degree of debt and selling off individual floors before the transaction closes.
Henglilong Investments Ltd is hoping to borrow 80 percent of the $2 billion cost of a deal to buy two office towers, and sell certain floors of the buildings separately, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.
The deal would be similar to one employed by a consortium that bought The Center skyscraper from Li last year for $5.2 billion.
The floor sales - known as ""strata-selling"" - would allow Henglilong to pocket profits quickly and repay the high-interest debt, the sources said.
The speculative strategy is likely to further push up Hong Kong's already sky-high property prices, market experts said, and could hurt the long-term asset value and management quality of Grade-A office buildings.
The strategy remains rare in Hong Kong premium property deals, but one of the sources said more investors were ready to jump in if The Center deals closed as planned.
""Many people in the market want to copy The Center deal because it's lucrative,"" the source said. ""They are waiting to see whether parts of The Center can be successfully divested as planned.""
Henglilong last month agreed to buy Cityplaza Three and Cityplaza Four, about a 15-minute drive from the central business district, from Swire Properties (HK:1972).
The company is in talks with investment banks, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to borrow 80 percent of the deal value via a private bond sale, two of the sources in the financial industry said.
The financing and selling plans were not final, the sources said, adding that it was unclear whether Henglilong was studying other options before the deal is completed in April 2019. Henglilong could not be contacted for comment.
Buyers of The Center were asking for as much as HK$55,000 ($7,008.51) per square foot, much higher than the HK$33,000 average cost implied by the total price tag.
No floor sales have been officially completed yet as potential buyers - mainly Chinese financial institutions - have put purchase plans on hold, wary of scrutiny by Beijing, which has been cracking down on overseas property purchases. ""We're ready to buy for our office use, but we're waiting for a state-owned company to make the move to buy first,"" said an executive of a Chinese financial company. ""We don't want to be in the headlines again saying Chinese companies are fuelling Hong Kong property prices.""
The financing strategy has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong regulators, who restrict commercial banks from lending over 40 percent of the property value to first-time commercial property buyers.
However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority only has the power to govern the financing activities of licensed banks, not investment banks.
After Reuters reported last year that the buyers of The Center planned to borrow as much as 90 percent to fund the deal, HKMA instructed commercial banks not to lend to them, according to two sources with direct knowledge. As a result, the consortium had to resort to a private bond sale with much higher interest rates - 7.5 percent for the senior tranche and 15.25 percent for the mezzanine tranche in the first year - than a bank plus mezzanine loan structure it had first pursued.
Rates for Henglilong are expected to be lower, however, as many investors are looking to get involved in mezzanine financing after The Center deal, one source said.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Light or dark? Six months on, MiFID 2 rules divide equity traders","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Six months after sweeping changes to the way European equity trading is regulated came into effect, a debate is raging among investors over whether the reform has succeeded in making market activity more transparent.
The European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, was introduced in January with the aim of pushing more trading onto regulated public exchanges where prices and participants can be seen by all.
At first glance, it seems to have failed its biggest test. The share of trading on so-called lit exchanges -- where prices and trades are clearly visible -- has barely risen in the first months of the new regime.
Such lit exchanges, together with a few alternative trading venues, have a 50.85 percent share of European equity trading so far this year, versus a 50.28 percent average in 2017, according to data collected by brokerage Rosenblatt Securities. 
But price swings in the lit exchanges have reduced, another aim of the rules implemented by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). And trading volumes have fallen significantly in dark pools -- non-transparent venues where trades did not contribute to price formation. 
Dark pool caps were first introduced in March, and apply to more than 900 stocks, the majority of European and FTSE100 components.
The outcomes have divided opinion.
""There's a risk of over-simplification that lit trading is good, dark trading bad. It really depends on what order you have and what you need to do to deliver value to the end investor,"" said Rebecca Healey, head of EMEA market structure and strategy at dark pool operator Liquidnet.
Many participants argue that less transparent strategies offer a helpful service for large investors who want to avoid prices moving against them when executing big trades. For this reason, large blocks of shares are exempt from the caps.
Accordingly, the average ""dark"" trade size has almost doubled, having risen in May to 23,190 euros from 12,488 euros in January. That is a sign investors are turning to non-transparent venues specifically for large trades.
""Dark is really meaning what the regulators intended it for: a larger trade size compared to the lit,"" said Anish Puaar, a market structure analyst at Rosenblatt. 
The rules will be tested in September when the first caps expire. If the regulator's model works, investors will stick to their new trading habits. But a snap back to dark trading should lead to the limits being re-imposed.

AUCTIONS UNDER FIRE
The fact remains though, that trading on lit exchanges has not increased. So where has it gone? 
There is evidence some is happening via periodic auctions -- closed intra-day auctions on exchanges where volumes have tripled since the dark caps came into force in March.
But because these auctions effectively mimic dark trading by hiding bids and offers from wider markets, some investors have dubbed them pseudo-dark pool trades.
ESMA head Steven Maijoor told the Federation of European Stock Exchanges last week that periodic auctions had ""caught the attention"" of regulators. The exchanges argue they simply offer an alternative trading method to prevent share prices moving against big investors.
""The most important thing is that customers really like it,"" Mark Hemsley, president of CBOE Europe and CEO at BATS Europe, said. ""What they're finding is when they actually execute in the auction it has a very low price impact in the market.""
CBOE's periodic auction platform has beaten expectations, with daily turnover now above $1 billion, Hemsley said.
Britain's regulator, the FCA, noted this week the auctions derived flows from uncapped stocks as well as capped, which suggests they are not an alternative to dark trading but a new type of strategy altogether.
But despite stellar growth, such auctions still account for just one percent of overall turnover, according to Reuters Market Share Reporter.

SYSTEMATIC INTERNALIZERS UNDER SCRUTINY
Bank-run trading venues called systematic internalizes (SI) are grabbing a more significant share of trading flow, representing a quarter of overall European turnover, according to Market Share Reporter and other data providers. 
MiFID II discontinued private trading networks run by banks, forcing them to re-register these services as SIs that can only execute trades against their own book and must provide public price quotes for trades up to ""standard market size"".
They stop short of full transparency, however.
""You can argue that around 30 percent of cash equity trading in Europe is bilateral against bank balance sheets -- they are dark, they are selective, they are not multilateral,"" said Lauri Rosendahl, president of Nasdaq Nordics, which runs Scandinavian exchanges.
""If regulators are trying to take pride in that cash equity trading is increasing on lit order books and that would be a MiFID 2 consequence, that's funny to the point of being absurd."" 
UBS exchanges analyst Michael Werner argued that high SI volumes may be down to double-counting, where both counterparties report a trade, adding: ""I don't buy the data.""
MiFID rules stipulate SIs must report detailed figures on transactions, including costs. These are due on June 30 and could clear up the muddy picture. 
Rosenblatt's Puaar also wants SIs to voluntarily disclose trading data but so far only high-frequency trading platform Jane Street has reported figures. 
For graphic on BCN and SI market share click https://reut.rs/2IvXfAP
All this feeds the view held by many that multiple trading venues with different criteria are unnecessarily fragmenting and complicating equity markets. But this may simply be the mark of a more competitive market, says CBOE's Hemsley.
""If you look at markets' development with MiFID I and II, a lot of the innovation has come from the competing venues that have come on board,"" he said.

They reduced their suggested equity allocations to 65 percent, the lowest level since September 2015 and down from 70.6 percent a month earlier, according to a poll of eight China-based fund managers conducted this week.
The fund managers have boosted their suggested bond allocations for the coming three months to 15.6 percent from 10.6 percent.
They have also hiked recommended cash allocations to 19.4 percent from 18.8 percent in the previous month.
""The collapse of trade talks between China and the United States was beyond market expectations, while Beijing's continued deleveraging campaign also aggravated already tight liquidity conditions in the market,"" a South China-based fund manager said.
The deleveraging effort has driven up borrowing costs for businesses and slowed the economy, and the fear is that any turmoil in China's markets could restrict Beijing's ability to pump-prime the economy as it tries to mount a defense in the trade battle with Washington.
Overall, the fund managers surveyed held mixed views on asset allocations for the next month, with six recommending the same level of equity exposure, one suggesting an increase, while another one suggesting a cut.
According to the poll, average recommended allocations for consumer stocks in the next three months rose sharply, those for financial services shares also edged up, while those for most other sectors fell, indicating fund managers' defensive stance as they ""huddled together for warmth"" in defensive plays including consumer firms.
For the month, average recommended allocations for consumer stocks leaped to 40.8 percent, the highest level since the launch of the poll in 2007, while those for finiancial stocks were raised to 11.5 percent from 11.9 percent a month earlier.

The survey of five Japan-based fund managers, conducted between June 13 and 25, showed respondents on average allocated 38.5 percent of their model portfolios to stocks in June, a slight increase from 38.3 percent in May. 
It was the first increase in six months after managers continuously reduced holdings of stocks on worries about geopolitical risks as well as trade tensions.
Concern about geopolitical disputes in East Asia subsided a tad after U.S. President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12, helping boost sentiment on Japanese shares. 
But many investors remained cautious as the U.S. administration threatens to impose tariffs on various imports, triggering warnings of retaliatory measures from China and many other countries.
""While the economic fundamentals are solid, concerns about Sino-U.S. trade frictions and political instabilities in Europe are likely to cap gains,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.
Fund managers kept their equity allocations by region mostly unchanged from those for May, with weightings on Japan almost flat at 48.9 percent and those on North America also little changed at 28.6 percent.
Their allocations on ex-Japan Asian shares were flat at 3.8 percent, matching near three-year lows in May, suggesting worries about the impact of Sino-U.S. trade frictions.
Fund managers trimmed overall allocation on bonds to 55.0 percent from 55.4 percent in the previous month, reversing three straight months of increase. Still, the June level was far above 42.9 percent in December. 
Within bonds, they raised weightings on North America to 30.9 percent from 30.4 percent, the fourth consecutive month with a hike.
They also raised euro zone weightings, to 21.1 percent from 20.6 percent in May, reversing four straight months of trimming.

Although Italian bonds were sold sharply since late May on political instabilities in Italy, markets steadied this month after a new government was formed and clarified that it has no immediate plans to ditch the euro.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Multinational companies like Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) and H&M (ST:HMb) are lobbying to soften a ban against single-use plastic imposed by an Indian state last week, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The ban by the state of Maharashtra, home to India's financial capital of Mumbai, could sharply raise costs for companies that rely heavily on plastic for packaging, such as retailers, beverage makers and sellers of bottled water.
Maharashtra's move, the first such broad action against plastic by an Indian state, comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes a plan to completely end the use of single-use plastic in India by 2022.
Plastic packaging accounts for nearly half of all plastic waste globally, and much of it is thrown away within just a few minutes of its first use, according to the United Nations.
Representatives of companies including Amazon, H&M, Pepsi (O:PEP) and Coca-Cola (N:KO), as well as plastic industry bodies and lobby groups, met with Maharashtra government officials days before the ban came into effect on June 23, urging them to implement the rule in phases and relax some norms, said the four sources who declined to be named.
""Our demand to the government is: give the industry seven years to come up with alternatives,"" said Neemit Punamiya, general secretary of the Plastic Bags Manufacturers Association of India, who attended the meeting. ""It cannot happen overnight - we've got investments, we've got loans to pay and people to manage.""
The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, whose members include online retailers such as Amazon India and Flipkart, said in a June 7 letter to the state government that such a ban ""will not be without its own share of adverse environmental impacts which are largely driven by issues associated with the use of alternatives"".
The Internet and Mobile Association of India, which also counts Amazon and Flipkart as members, said it had asked the state to ease the rules but did not specify what relaxation it was seeking.
Beverage makers such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, meanwhile, want an exemption from the rules as they mandate a buyback of empty bottles at a guaranteed price, which will raise costs, another source familiar with the talks said.
Amazon, Flipkart, Pepsi and Coca-Cola did not respond to requests for comment. H&M said in a statement that it supported reusing and recycling, adding that the company had asked the government to clarify the rules and for help coming up with solutions.
Maharashtra's environment minister said Wednesday that the government would relax rules for neighborhood grocery stores allowing them to pack commodities such as rice and pulses in plastic. They would, however, have to ensure buyers return the packaging for recycling.
A senior state official told Reuters the government could moderate some aspects of the rule for online retailers as well or give them more time to comply. Another official confirmed that issues raised by the industry was being looked into.
Both officials declined to be named as the talks are not public.
ENFORCING COMPLIANCE
Maharashtra's plastic ban includes bags, food containers, spoons, forks, glasses and packaging wraps - which the local plastics industry says could cost it up to 150 billion rupees ($2.20 billion) a year and nearly 300,000 jobs.
For online retailers, cost is one of the main issues.
An e-commerce industry source said that packaging charges comprise about 2 percent to 3.5 percent of fulfilment costs - the price of shipping, delivery and compensating sellers for discounts - and that the use of biodegradable plastic or other alternatives could push these costs higher.
Cardboard boxes, for example, could cost nearly a third more than plastic packing, according to industry estimates cited by the Economic Times daily.
Since the ban came into force, squads of officials in Mumbai have been raiding shops and restaurants, sometimes accompanied by police, to enforce compliance.
Violations could result in penalties of up to 25,000 rupees ($362.49) and jail terms of up to three months.
Nidhi Choudhari, Mumbai's deputy municipal commissioner, told Reuters it has collected more than 1.3 million rupees in penalties so far.
Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of the Chintan environmental advocacy group in New Delhi, said she feared the plastics industry would use any compliance extensions to try to put off the ban indefinitely.
""We should really have a hard ban,"" she said.

Nine defendants including  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL), the JBS USA unit of Brazil's JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), WH Group Ltd's (HK:0288) Smithfield Foods Inc and  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) were accused of colluding since 2009 to limit production, with the ""intent and expected result"" of increasing pork prices.
Thirteen individual consumers from around the country are seeking class-action status and a variety of damages for alleged overcharges since Jan. 1, 2009, in a complaint filed with the federal court in Minnesota.
According to the complaint, U.S. pork sales totaled $18.9 billion in 2016, and the defendants and their co-conspirators control more than 80 percent of the wholesale market.
Hormel said it intended to defend itself, and was confident that the allegations have no merit. Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson declined to comment. JBS and Smithfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The case resembles litigation in Chicago federal court where consumers accused many companies, including Tyson and JBS' majority-owned Pilgrim's Pride, of conspiring to fix broiler chicken prices.
According to Thursday's complaint, the pork conspiracy began when the defendant Agri Stats Inc began giving pork companies ""benchmarking"" reports, which typically allow comparisons of profits and performance.
But the consumers said Agri Stats went farther, offering ""sensitive"" data on costs, prices and slaughter rates and the ability to decipher which data belonged to which companies.
They said this permitted the pork companies to monitor each other's production, and as a result control supply and price.
""The provision of this detailed information acts as the proverbial smoke-filled room of the cartels of yesteryear,"" the complaint said.
Agri Stats is also a defendant in the broiler chicken case. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thursday's lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in St. Paul.
The case is Duryea et al v. Agri Stats Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-01776.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Taiwanese high-tech company Foxconn and vaguely threatened U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson on a campaign-style trip on Thursday to Wisconsin, a state that supported him in the 2016 election. 
Against a backdrop of a growing trade conflict between the United States and China, Trump helped Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, to break ground on a 13,000-employee U.S. plant.
""As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States. America is open for business,"" Trump said.
Trump also had words for Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG), which he has threatened with higher taxes if it moves production for European customers overseas.
""Harley-Davidson, please build those beautiful motorcycles in the USA,"" he said. ""Don't get cute with us, don't get cute."" 
Trump has levied tariffs on U.S. allies for what he considers unfair trade practices, sparking trade disputes that Harley-Davidson cited as its reason for moving some production overseas and which Foxconn has also cited as a major challenge.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce still has not worked out the details necessary for lifting the ban on China's ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), a spokesman said on Thursday, even though an official last week said the final steps would be taken in a ""couple of days.""
""The department continues to work with ZTE,"" the Commerce spokesman said. He declined to comment on the cause of the delay. 
ZTE, China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker, did not respond to requests for comment.
ZTE, which makes smart phones and networking gear, ceased major operations after the Commerce Department banned it from buying U.S.-origin goods in April for breaking an agreement reached after the company violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
ZTE last year paid $892 million in civil and criminal penalties and pleaded guilty in federal court in Texas in connection with the activity.
In a new June 7 settlement, ZTE agreed to pay an additional $1 billion penalty and put $400 million in an escrow account to regain access to American-made components.
The escrow account is designed to allow the United States to access the money in the event ZTE violates the latest settlement, which also requires the company to install a new board and management, among numerous other conditions. 
Last Friday, a Commerce Department official told Reuters that ZTE was expected to deposit the $400 million in an escrow account in the ""next couple of days."" The official said that was the last step before the ban could be lifted.
Terms of the escrow agreement were in the process of being finalized, sources told Reuters last Friday. 
On Thursday, the Commerce Department spokesman said the department was still working with ZTE toward completion of the $400 million in escrow and the lifting of the ban.

Members of the U.S. Congress have raised questions about the settlement, citing ZTE's ties to the Chinese government and calling it a national security threat. The ZTE ban also has come up in trade negotiations between the United States and China.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 07:15PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank fails Fed stress test while three U.S. lenders stumble,"By Michelle Price and David Henry
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG's (DE:DBKGn) U.S. subsidiary failed on Thursday the second part of the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual stress tests due to ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in the bank's capital planning controls. 
The Fed board's unanimous objection to Deutsche Bank's U.S. capital plan marks another blow for the German lender, sending its shares down 1 percent after hours. Its financial health globally has been under intense scrutiny after S&P cut its rating and questioned its plan to return to profitability.
The Fed also placed conditions on three banks that passed the test.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) cannot increase their capital distributions and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) must improve its counterparty risk management and analysis, the Fed said. 
Deutsche Bank last week easily cleared the Fed's easier first hurdle that measures its capital levels against a severe recession, the strictest ever run by the Fed.
Thursday's second test focuses on how the bank's plan for that capital, such as dividend payouts and investments, stands up against the harsh scenarios.
""Concerns include material weaknesses in the firm’s data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress,"" the Fed said in a statement.
While failing the U.S. stress test would not likely affect the bank's ability to pay dividends to shareholders, it will require Deutsche Bank to make substantial investment in technology, operations, risk management and personnel, as well as changes to its governance. 
It also means the bank would not be able to make any distributions to its German parent without the Fed's approval and could potentially result in the bank further paring back some of its U.S. operations. 
In a statement on Thursday, Deutsche Bank said it had made significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities as well as controls and infrastructure at its U.S. subsidiary and would work with regulators to ""continue to build on these efforts."" 
The newly created U.S. subsidiaries of six foreign lenders, Deutsche Bank,  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN), UBS Group AG (S:UBSG),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP),  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) and Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY), went through the test for the second time this year had their results publicly released for the first time.
Deutsche Bank's results cover DB USA Corp, a holding company with $133 billion in assets, according to Deutsche Bank’s March filings. This includes all of Deutsche Bank’s non-branch U.S. assets, including its mortgage lending and debt financing subsidiary, and its sizable Wall Street broker-dealer trading business.
The test results follow months of turmoil for Germany's largest lender, whose shares are down 43 percent this year in Frankfurt.
The bank abruptly reshuffled management in April after three consecutive years of losses. It then announced it would scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe and its home market. It has flagged cuts to U.S. bond trading, equities and the business that serves hedge funds.
But Thursday's result will raise further questions among analysts and investors as to whether regulators should take a tougher line and even push the bank to more aggressively pare back its U.S. operations.
David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he was ""astounded"" that the results showed continued risk management and operational problems at the subsidiary of a major global bank. 
“It’s like a plane that isn't safe to fly because the flight systems are malfunctioning,"" he said.
The focus will now shift to European authorities and how they plan to tackle Deutsche’s problems, he added.
CONDITIONAL APPROVALS
The Fed otherwise approved the capital plans for 34 lenders, allowing them to use the extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes. 
These included household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), as well as major regional lenders like  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (N:USB). 
The country's top regulator said it conditionally approved the capital plans for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley whose capital levels had been adversely affected during the test by last year's changes to the U.S. tax code.
Those banks will maintain their capital distribution levels in-line with those paid in recent years to bolster their capital cushion, the Fed said.
After the results were announced, Morgan Stanley said that it will distribute $6.8 billion, in line with last year's payout. 

Goldman Sachs said it would return up to $6.3 billion, including $5 billion through share buybacks and $1.3 billion in dividends, which will rise to a quarterly rate of 85 cents per share from 80 cents.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) adviser was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Thursday after he admitted that he misused client funds to invest in and support a wind farm project that a friend had decided to start.
Cornelius Peterson, 29, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston, who said the former financial adviser deserved a significant prison term for misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars from two clients' accounts.
""You were someone who didn't need the money,"" Gorton said. ""Well, today you find that fraud and financial crimes that hurt people don't go unpunished.""
Peterson, who pleaded guilty in February to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, did not speak during the hearing.
In a letter to Gorton, Peterson said he was ""ashamed and remorseful."" His lawyer, Carol Starkey, in court argued that he played a minor role in a scheme that his supervisor orchestrated.
Peterson's boss in Morgan Stanley's Boston office, James Polese, pleaded guilty in April to related charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August.
According to his lawyers, in 2013 Peterson became friendly with an entrepreneur investing in wind farm projects and offered to help him raise money for a private equity fund called Commonwealth Bay that would invest in them.
In 2014, Peterson, who had become a member of the fund's board of directors, transferred $100,000 from the account of one of his clients without his permission to invest in a wind farm project, prosecutors said.
He did so along with Polese, who had become an investor in the project, which needed financing, prosecutors said.
Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an 86-year-old long-time client of Morgan Stanley to back a letter of credit in support of the wind farm project, prosecutors said.
In addition, both men without approval in 2016 transferred $350,000 from that same client's account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese's own and family’s expenses, according to court papers.
""Mr. Peterson took advantage of his clients and took their money for his own uses,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Bloom said.
New York-based Morgan Stanley fired both men in June 2017. The bank has said that it immediately terminated them after uncovering their misconduct and reported the matter to authorities.

In addition to the prison sentence, Peterson must pay $462,000 in restitution jointly with Polese.

(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) shareholders will vote on Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) revised $71 billion bid for Fox's entertainment assets on July 27, the companies said. 
The shareholder vote effectively sets a deadline for Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) to come back with a higher bid for Fox if it wishes to continue its bidding war for the media company.
Fox had originally scheduled its shareholder vote for July 10, but delayed it in order to give shareholders more time to review its revised agreement with Disney. 
Disney raised its bid from around $52 billion in stock to $71 billion in cash and stock after Comcast earlier countered with a $65 billion all-cash bid. 
Earlier this week, Disney won U.S. Justice Department approval for its deal with Fox on condition it sell 22 of Fox's regional sports networks.
Comcast has filed for a regulatory review but has not yet reached a settlement with regulators. 
Disney shareholders will also vote on the deal on the same day.

The Fed found “widespread and critical deficiencies across the firm’s capital-planning practices,” according to a statement Thursday. It cited weaknesses in Deutsche Bank’s risk-management functions and data capabilities, as well as the methodology and assumptions used to forecast how the unit would fare under stress.
Of the 18 domestic and foreign banks that faced the qualitative section of the exam, Deutsche Bank was the only one to receive an objection. The finding shows authorities remain frustrated with the company’s U.S. arm, which they added last year to a confidential list of troubled lenders.
“Together, these weaknesses raise concerns about DB USA’s ability to effectively determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis,” the Fed said.
Deutsche Bank said the U.S. business “has made significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities as well as controls and infrastructure.” The unit is still making progress and working with regulators, according to a statement posted on the web.
The U.S. unit of Germany’s largest bank was the only firm to fail the second round of this year’s stress tests, which were established as part of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulations. All 35 of the lenders in the opening round showed they could withstand a severe economic downturn, the Fed announced last week.
Some analysts had predicted that Deutsche Bank would fail the qualitative portion of the test, which focuses on internal controls, even as the unit’s capital levels exceeded required minimums by wide margins. A firm receiving an objection may resubmit its capital plan, but isn’t required to do so.
Six foreign firms have U.S. holding companies debuting in this year’s stress test and all aside from Deutsche Bank passed. In previous years, Deutsche Bank’s custodian unit participated, failing twice. Now, almost all of the company’s operations in the U.S. are subject to the exam.
Why Deutsche Bank Can’t Just Shake Off Its Problems: QuickTake
Failure can prevent a bank’s local business from shifting capital back to its parent company. The Fed could approve a specific capital distribution if a bank requested it, senior officials said.
Still, the impact on Deutsche Bank is limited. The Frankfurt-based firm draws on other resources to pay profits to shareholders, and has enough cash in Europe to maintain operations.
“Deutsche Bank doesn’t have an issue with liquidity, so the test will probably amount to a slap on the wrist with no major financial implications,” Tom Hallett, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, said prior to Thursday’s announcement.
Among non-U.S. banks, units of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada and UBS Group AG also faced the qualitative test for the first time.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA’s U.S. unit was also new to the test, but it wasn’t subject to the risk-control grading. Analysts had expected others besides Deutsche Bank might fail because they were still unfamiliar with the Fed’s data demands even after taking them with grades given privately last year.
Two more foreign banks were also subject to the Fed’s qualitative review, though this isn’t their first year publicly releasing results. The U.S. businesses of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Toronto-Dominion Bank both passed.
HSBC said earlier this month its U.S. unit was able to send dividends to the parent company last year for the first time since 2006. Even though HSBC’s U.S. division had passed the stress test since 2014, high capital demands for its holdings of legacy mortgage assets trapped capital at the unit, the firm explained.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) five-member commission voted 5-0 to propose a rule to allow companies that sell ETFs to launch plain vanilla versions without first seeking approval from the regulator. The SEC said it hopes the rule change will boost competition and innovation by lowering the barriers to entry. 
The rule change, subject to feedback from the industry, would apply to open-ended ETFs, a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares it can issue, which covers the vast majority of ETFs today. 
Dozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage.
ETF issuers must get SEC permission, known as exemptive relief, before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Democratic Commissioner Rob Jackson said he reluctantly voted for the rule change due to potential risk factors to investors, while Commissioner Kara Stein, also a Democrat, emphasized the enforcement of existing oversight controls.
""The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount - each as of the prior business day,"" said Stein.
The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group that advocates for regulated funds, including ETFs, applauded the SEC proposal.
""Investors - and the asset managers who serve them - deserve a more uniform ETF regulatory framework. The time is right to codify these exemptive orders into a single rule,"" the group said in a statement. 
Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said the proposed rule change could ""support new ETF launches, particularly tied to long-term thematic approaches, from small independent asset managers.""
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group accounted for more than 60 percent of the record inflows of $655 billion that entered ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc.

Melissa Garville, a BlackRock spokeswoman, said: ""ETFs are driving investor progress by helping tens of millions of people generate wealth and meet retirement goals. That is why BlackRock has long supported regulation of the ETF market that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors. We look forward to reviewing the proposal in more detail and commenting in due course.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchange operator IEX Group took issue with a claim by the New York Stock Exchange that a plan by regulators to test lowering exchange fees and rebates would cost investors at least $1 billion, calling it ""false and unfounded."" 
""NYSE has attempted to garner support from Main Street by purposely misleading companies with a false narrative of investor and issuer harm,"" IEX said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) dated June 27. 
The SEC in March said it planned to test the effects of lowering stock exchange fees and rebates, which would be banned altogether for some stocks, for one to two years, following widespread criticism of the current pricing system.
Critics of the pricing regime, including dozens of institutional investors that support the SEC's proposal, say it creates conflicts by giving brokers incentives to send customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest rebates, even when better results for their clients might be found elsewhere.
The NYSE, in a letter to the SEC on May 31, said the so-called transaction fee pilot would result in wider bid-ask spreads on stocks, driving up costs for investors. The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), also said the pilot would harm competition by driving more trading to off-exchange venues, undermining the SEC's legal obligation to promote efficient markets. 
IEX, which does not pay rebates, argued that banning the payments was unlikely to lead to uniformly wider spreads, and that lower exchange fees would likely result in more trading on exchanges. Rebates, IEX said, were more about attracting order flow. 
""We believe that NYSE's real concern is not with less exchange volume or price transparency, but the potential impact on its own profitability,"" said the letter, signed by IEX's Chief Market Policy Officer John Ramsay, former head of market regulation at the SEC.

The NYSE is not alone in its criticism of the SEC proposal. Rival exchange operators Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Cboe Global Markets (O:CBOE) have also voiced their opposition.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is not producing enough Model 3s per shift to reach the 5,000 per week target that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said it would reach by Saturday, three line workers at the company's Fremont, California, assembly plant told Reuters this week. 
The company was able to assemble and paint 210 Model 3s during the first of two 12-hour shifts on Wednesday, one worker told Reuters. On one of two Monday shifts, the company produced 305 of the vehicles, another worker told Reuters. The number of vehicles assembled per shift is displayed for line workers in the plant. 
The company is running two 12-hour shifts per day every day this week on the Model 3, the two workers who provided the production figures said. If the company produces 300 Model 3 vehicles during all 14 shifts, it would produce 4,200 cars for the week.
Tesla declined to comment on its production numbers or on employee reports of problems.
The Model 3, initially promised at a base price of $35,000, is meant to be the mass market vehicle that can propel electric-powered vehicles into the mainstream and Tesla into profitability. But Tesla has struggled to produce the volume of cars it needs because of problems with the assembly line and other snafus. 
The company’s Fremont, California, factory has also been plagued by a series of fires, including at least two in June.
At the company’s shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said it was ""quite likely"" that Tesla would be able to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June. At the time, Tesla was producing 3,500 of the vehicles per week, Musk said.
But the worker who provided the production figure for Wednesday's first shift said bottlenecks persist. 
“Paint can't handle the load right now because they have the Model S and X that they normally do and now they have all these Model 3s,"" the worker told Reuters. ""The paint department just can't keep up.”
“Basically we have been in a long endurance race, and now the coach is yelling at us for a 4-mile finishing kick,” said one employee at the company’s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, where batteries for the Model 3 are made.
To reach Musk's goal, the company has borrowed workers from its Model S and Model X lines this week to work on the Model 3, and on Wednesday, factory supervisors announced to workers that everyone is to come in on Saturday.
Earlier this month, Musk tweeted a photo of a new Model 3 production line built inside a tent on the company’s Fremont campus. “Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production,” Musk tweeted on June 18. “A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks.”
But the tented line is only producing a few cars so far, said the worker who provided the production figure for one of Monday's shifts.

1082,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Mexican Assets Rally Three Days Ahead of Historic Election,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks and bonds rallied and the peso posted its biggest one-day gain in more than a year amid growing conviction that a victory for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be better received by the market than expected.
The peso climbed 2.2 percent, posting the largest gain since March 2017, while the Mexbol stock index put in its best performance in two weeks and nearly all Mexico USD sovereign bonds rallied.
Left-leaning firebrand Lopez Obrador is set to win a landslide victory in the July 1 election, while control of the Lower House and the Senate remains in the balance. After Lopez Obrador’s rise put assets under pressure through the year, assets are now moving higher as the markets have long priced in his win. His cabinet choice and messaging after the election will likely be well-received by markets,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a report today.
""Investors have been growing more comfortable with the potential outcome, and the lack of USD pressure makes this sentiment more pronounced,"" said Danny Fang, an analyst at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in New York. ""There are still political risks in Mexico, but that is probably for a later time.""
The market is also being helped by comments from central bank deputy governor Javier Guzman Calafell who told attendees at a Santander (MC:SAN) event in London that the central bank will be there to respond to emerging circumstances.
""It’s a combination of factors,"" said Jesus Lopez, an analyst at Banco Base in Monterrey. ""It’s the confirmation that Banxico is ready to continue raising its interest rate, together with the increase from last week and a clear increase in the demand for assets in pesos."""

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>","Canada to aid steel, aluminum industries hit by U.S. tariffs: source","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will hit back against U.S. tariffs on its steel and aluminum by offering affected companies and workers up to C$800 million ($603 million) in aid, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland will make an announcement in the steel city of Hamilton at 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) on Friday. 
The source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Freeland will announce the aid and reveal a list of U.S. goods that Canada intends to subject to retaliatory tariffs. 
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum last month, citing national security reasons. The move helped upend one of the world's most important trading relationships and soured ties between Ottawa and Washington.
Freeland said on June 19 that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was working on ways to directly support the steel and aluminum industries and their workers.
Freeland's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The source said the assistance - to be spread over several years - would be similar to an C$867 million five-year package offered to Canadian softwood lumber producers in 2017 after Washington imposed tariffs.
That took the form of loans, loan guarantees, commercial financing and support to help firms expand overseas markets. It also included money to help affected workers learn new skills and provided support for work-sharing agreements.
The source did not say which steel and aluminum firms would be in line for help. Companies with operations in Canada include Evraz Plc,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Plc, Algoma Acquisition Corp [ALGMA.UL], Essar Steel Algoma Inc [ESSRGE.UL], ArcelorMittal SA and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp.
Canada promised to react by imposing retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6 billion worth of U.S. exports and Freeland is due to outline exactly which goods will be hit, said the source.
Trump is also threatening to impose tariffs on Canadian autos, which would cause significantly more economic harm.
Senior officials from Canada are lobbying the Big Three U.S. car makers to stave off the punitive measures and say they are considering all options, including providing financial aid.

1. Inflation, Manufacturing, Sentiment Data Eyed
A regional U.S. manufacturing report, consumer sentiment data and crucial update on the Fed's preferred measure of inflation will round off this week's release of top-tier economic data on Friday.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index due 8:30 am – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – is expected to show 0.2% growth for May and 1.9% growth year-on-year, up slightly from 1.8% the prior month.
The PCE deflator data, a measure of inflation based on changes in personal consumption, will also be in focus after rising 2% in April.
The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) due 09:45 is expected to show a reading of 60.1, down from a prior reading of 62.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion of the manufacturing sector; a reading below indicates contraction.
Michigan’s consumer sentiment index due 10:00 am ET is forecast to show a reading of 99.1 roughly unchanged from the previous month, while consumer expectations data will also be in focus.
Economic data so far this week has played second fiddle to trade-related headlines but a slowdown in U.S. economic growth reported Thursday weighed on sentiment somewhat.
The dollar clawed back losses against a basket of major currencies on Thursday to trade flat as EUR/USD gave up some of its gains.
2. Meltdown in Pharma Sector to Continue? 
The fallout from the selloff in Pharma stocks will likely remain in focus Friday as investors assess as the impact of Amazon's entry into the pharmacy sector following its acquisition of online pharmacy company PillPack.
The main brick-and-mortar drug store stocks such as CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) sunk on the news and closed sharply lower.
The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year, according to a statement.
PillPack ships medications in packaging that is sorted by the dose, and also handles refills and renewals.
This is not Amazon's first foray into health care as the e-commerce behemoth teamed up with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (NYSE:BRKa) earlier this year in a bid to solve US employee healthcare issues.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed 2.47% higher at $1,701.45.
3. US Rig Count Data; Crude Prices Post-Settlement Plunge in Focus
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production.
Data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs fell for the first time in weeks, pointing to signs of tightening in U.S. output.
U.S. oil output, however, remains at record levels of about 10.9 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
Market participants will also monitor any potential updates on U.S. sanctions, after crude oil prices retreated heading into settlement, on the back of concerns that the United States may allow some countries to continue importing Iranian crude imports.
Crude futures settled 69 cents higher at $73.45 a barrel."

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 03:53PM ET</span>",Amazon to buy PillPack in potentially disruptive drug retail push,"By Ankur Banerjee and Bill Berkrot
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Thursday it would buy small online pharmacy PillPack, a move that will put the world's biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers.
The deal's potential to disrupt major players across the drug supply chain nationwide prompted a sell-off in shares of possible rivals, while sending Amazon shares up 2.7 percent.
PillPack supplies pre-sorted prescription drugs and other services to people who take multiple medications, a growing market as the U.S. population ages and requires treatment for multiple complex, chronic conditions.
The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person it said was familiar with the matter. 
Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost around $14 billion in market value, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion.
Shares of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) were down 6.3 percent after falling as much as 10 percent, while Walgreen Boots Alliance was off nearly 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) also fell sharply.
The news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) named a chief executive who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs.
WARNING SHOT
Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon's competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems.
""PillPack has tens of thousands of customers across the country, will do over $100 million in revenue this year, and has launched PharmacyOS ... designed specifically for customers with complex medication regimens,"" company spokeswoman Jacquelyn Miller said in an email.
""Amazon's acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), such as CVS and Express Scripts, which negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans, also run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill their prescriptions with them.
Doctors, insurers and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main reasons for increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs.
With Amazon's announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer/PBM mergers of  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) with CVS and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) with Express Scripts ""are even more critical now."" 
NOT WORRIED
Walgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was ""not particularly worried"" about the PillPack deal.
""The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,"" Pessina said.
That said, Pessina added, ""We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction.""
Some analysts played down the immediate threat.
Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj said he did not believe the deal would make Amazon ""a major disruptor"" in the near term.
""I believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments,"" he said.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies.
""Even if PillPack is a network provider today, it does not mean it will be a network provider in the future, especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume,"" he said.
Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later.
PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines.
PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/02/walmart-buying-pillpack-online-pharmacy-sources.htmlreported in April. The deal is expected to close during the second half of 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, as losses in shares of healthcare companies, battered by Amazon's foray into drug retailing, were offset by gains in the technology and financial sectors.
The S&P 500 financial index was on track to post its first gain in 14 sessions ahead of results from the second round of the U.S. Federal Reserve's stress test for banks and lenders.
But shares of several drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers fell after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, already under pressure after its third-quarter earnings report, tumbled 9.3 percent after touching more than a 3-1/2-year low. It weighed the most on the Dow, followed by UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), which fell 1.1 percent.
Shares of CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) sank 6.4 percent, Rite Aid Corp shares fell 11.1 percent and Express Scripts Holding Co shares were down 1.3 percent. Amazon, by contrast, rose 2.4 percent.
Earlier in the session, the S&P 500 seesawed between gains and losses. Some investors expressed caution, given lingering worries regarding U.S. trade relations, as the end of the quarter approached.
""We're just treading water,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""There's been inconsistency out of the White House as to what the (trade) policy actually is. We're all just waiting and tapping our foot to see the actual policy.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 122.74 points, or 0.51 percent, to 24,240.33, the S&P 500 gained 16.59 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,716.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.52 points, or 0.77 percent, to 7,502.61.
Amazon's reach was not limited to the health sector. Its plans to entice entrepreneurs to set up their own package-delivery businesses sent shares of  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) skidding 2.3 percent and more than 2 percent. 
Accenture PLC rose 5.3 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider reported quarterly revenue and profit above estimates.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) dropped 3.4 percent after the company said its Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw will retire at the end of November. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 107 new lows.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",U.S. fines CVS for failing to report opioid theft in New York,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil fine to resolve U.S. charges that some of its pharmacies in Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York failed to report in a timely manner the loss or theft of prescription drugs, including the opioid hydrocodone.
Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, on Thursday said delays contribute to opioid abuse, and that CVS' failures impeded the ability of Drug Enforcement Administration agents to investigate, violating federal law.
CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This settlement is significant because it shows that big chain pharmacies, like CVS, are taking responsibility for violating federal law, which is a step in the right direction for curbing the opioid epidemic,"" DEA Special Agent-in-Charge James Hunt said in a statement.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in a record 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
CVS has more than 130 pharmacies in Nassau and Suffolk, according to its website.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Fox shareholder urges Murdoch to give Comcast time to beat Disney bid,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - TCI Fund Management Ltd, a large Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) shareholder, has urged Fox executive chairman Rupert Murdoch to give Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) a chance to top Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) $71 billion offer to buy most of Fox's assets, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. 
The hedge fund, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, owns 7.4 percent of Fox shares and said he disagreed with Fox's view that Comcast's bid would come with higher regulatory risk. TCI is ""strongly motivated"" to support whichever deal came at a higher price. 
The letter highlights shareholder appetite for a continued bidding war between Disney and Comcast over Fox, whose stock traded 1.7 percent higher on Thursday at $49.62, more than $10 above Disney's revised, roughly $38 per share offer. 
Disney, Fox and TCI declined to comment. Comcast could not be reached immediately for comment. 
Hohn’s $17.5 billion hedge fund has held stakes in German carmaker  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), Airbus Group (PA:AIR) and aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF), and called for changes to boost their stock prices. 
Hohn said a U.S. judge's recent approval of AT&T Inc's (N:T) agreement to acquire  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) is ""unequivocally positive"" for similar deals, such as Comcast's bid for Fox. 
He also said the U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Disney earlier this week, which cleared the way for that company's planned acquisition of Fox, further reduced the regulatory risk for a potential Comcast deal. 
Hohn said the timetable for a Comcast deal would be roughly similar to a one with Disney, given the need for either transaction to obtain regulatory approvals internationally. 
Disney agreed to buy Fox for $71 billion in stock on June 20, trumping a $65 billion cash bid from Comcast. Disney had originally agreed to buy Fox for around $52 billion late last year. 
Fox delayed its planned shareholder meeting, scheduled for next month, to give Comcast time to come back with a higher bid. 
The Fox assets in play include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox’s stake in Hulu.
Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. 
A deal for Fox would allow Comcast to better adapt to new trends in the pay-TV industry, as consumers abandon traditional cable bundles in favor of web-based offerings such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).

The Financial Times first reported on the letter.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",UK takeover panel to review impact of Disney bid for Fox on Sky,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's takeover regulator is considering whether Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) might have to make a higher offer for Sky (L:SKYB) in the wake of the U.S. company's move to hike its bid for Twenty-First Century Fox assets to $71.3 billion.
Sky, Rupert Murdoch's Fox, Disney and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are in the midst of complicated takeover battle that revolves around competing offers for the bulk of Fox's film and television assets and London-listed broadcaster Sky.
In December 2016, Fox offered 10.75 pounds-a-share to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, only for Comcast to make a rival 12.50 pounds-per-share counterbid for the London-listed company in February. 
At the same time, both Disney and Comcast are vying to acquire Fox's TV and film assets, which include Fox's 39 percent stake in Sky. 
Disney last week raised its cash-and-shares offer for the Fox assets to $38-a-share from its original offer of $28-per-share, to trump a rival $35-a-share all-cash bid made by Comcast.
Britain's Takeover Panel said on Thursday that its executive was now examining the implications for Sky of Disney's improved offer for the Fox assets on June 20.
In April, the panel ruled that under its so-called ""chain principle"", Disney must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Fox's 39 percent stake in the broadcaster, provided that neither Fox nor Comcast had already succeeded with their own offers for the British company. 
At the time, the panel said Disney would need to offer Sky's minority shareholders 10.75 pounds-a-share if the U.S. giant was obliged to make a chain principle offer.
""The executive is considering what impact the 20 June increase (by Disney for the Fox assets) should have on the consideration payable under the chain principle offer and will make a further announcement in due course,"" the takeover regulator said on Thursday. 
It added that it had ""received submissions from a number of parties expressing diverging views in relation to this matter, including from Disney, Fox and the independent directors of Sky.""
Fox's original 10.75 pounds-a-share offer valued all of Sky at 18.5 billion pounds, while Comcast's 12.50 pounds-a-share bid put a 22.1 billion-pound price tag on the British broadcaster.
If the panel now decides that Disney must make a mandatory offer for Sky that is higher than 10.75 pounds-a-share, it would essentially set a new floor under the price of the UK company's shares.

Sky stock was barely changed on Thursday, closing up less than 0.1 percent at 14.535 pounds.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 01:32PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturers, steel makers battle over tariff relief","By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - The flood of requests from U.S. manufacturers with the Commerce Department to exempt them from the Trump administration’s hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is exposing competitive information to rivals, customers and U.S. metal producers.
The tariff exemptions process is a new front in a battle between U.S. steel and aluminum consumers, fighting to keep prices for those metals down, and U.S. metal producers which argue that foreign rivals have kept prices low with unfair trading practices.
So far, over 22,500 applications for exemptions have landed in Washington and many more arrive each day. Over 4,000 objections have been filed, which is also expected to grow.
Only 98 applications have been processed as of last week, and of those, only 42 were approved, according to the Commerce Department.
Companies are required to fill out a five-page form for each type of product it imports that details everything from the chemical composition of the metal and the volumes they use to its strength and where they are currently buying it overseas.
Those are details nearly every manufacturer considers highly proprietary, since it can be used to assess their cost structure. Competitors can use such insights to tell customers that the other company is likely to face supply shortages or is about to sharply raise prices.
Greenfield Industries Inc, a subsidiary of China's TDC Cutting Tools Inc in Seneca, South Carolina, has filed 1,176 requests to exempt the various types of specialty steel it imports from China to make cutting tools at its 330-employee U.S. operation. 
In one application, for instance, Greenfield states ""the sole U.S. producer of high speed steel material appropriate for cutting tools is not currently ramping up any production to expand this aspect of their business and has not shown any interest in quoting new business.""
The applications give a roadmap to domestic metal producers seeking to block an exemption entirely. U.S. steel makers may file objections, each three pages long, to make the case that they can provide the metal to a customer instead of that customer using an overseas supplier. 
 Nucor  Corp. (N:NUE), the Charlotte-based steelmaker, is among those filing objections. 
“We are seeing exclusion requests where the volume being requested far exceeds the entity’s actual consumption or capacity,"" said Katherine Miller, a Nucor spokeswoman. 
She added that one request was for 30-times more volume than the company's capacity. 
One reason a company might exaggerate their needs is that the system does not define clearly what it means for a product to be available from a domestic source. Many applications note that, while a metal is available domestically, it’s not produced in the quantity required by domestic metal consumers.
Cost is not a reason for metals consumers to get relief. If a domestic producer says it can supply a product, no matter the price, it can potentially block an exemption request. 
Other big steelmakers as well as other metal producers and processors, including United States Steel Corp (N:X) and AK Steel Holding Corp (N:AKS), are also filing objections. U.S. Steel referred inquiries to the company’s public statements, which have welcomed the tariffs, while AK Steel declined to discuss the exclusion process or their objections.
NLMK Pennsylvania LLC, a subsidiary of Russia's NLMK Group which imports Russian-made steel slabs and rolls them into coils at its plant in Farrell, Pennsylvania, filed an application that says, in part, ""our (U.S.) competitors consume slab they make for their internal needs and have no excess capacity available for sale on a consistent, stable basis."" 
Nucor objected, stating there are ""adequate supplies"" of domestic steel slab and that ""access to low-priced imported steel is not a sufficient basis for an exclusion.""
NLMK's CEO Bob Miller told Reuters the objection from Nucor is “anti-competitive,” noting that Nucor is saying they make a product that can be used as a substitute for steel slab — the hot and cold-rolled coils of steel that both companies sell to end customers.
“So they’re basically saying they should have their customers buy hot and cold-rolled coils from us — and let NLMK go out of business,” said Miller, who also does not like that there’s no way to “rebut an objection.” 
“It’s a total lack of due process,” he said.
Nucor did not wish to comment on their objection beyond their filing.
""GREAT SALES TOOL""
A review of filings by Reuters show how competitors are jumping into the fray. 
Barry Zekelman, CEO of Chicago-based Zekelman Industries, a privately held maker of pipe and tube, estimates his company has filed a “couple dozen” objections and that he views the process as a “great sales tool.” He said the filings often show that the real motive for imports is to buy goods more cheaply offshore from low-cost countries like Turkey, Brazil and China.
Zekelman said it is too early to tell how much business he will gain from the process, but he expects those gains to come in the second half of this year.
The makeup of the metal only complicates the application process. Steel is not a single commodity, but rather a complex market made up of hundreds of different grades and types of metal that vary in terms of ease of stamping, resistance to breakage and other properties. For many uses, a new steel supplier has to be certified to assure that the steel meets the end-customer's specifications.
Another issue is staffing. The Commerce Department is rushing to hire workers to handle the applications, which has many applicants worrying that the government workers will be ill-prepared to sift through the arguments.
“The concern is that these requests aren’t properly vetted” by people with expertise in the complexities of steel and aluminum production, said Alexander Russ, director of international and regulatory affairs at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, a trade group. 

“It's bleak to say the least for companies trying to get an exclusion,” said Russ.

The supermarket group is testing the smartphone app at the Tesco Express convenience store located in the campus of its headquarters at Welwyn Garden City, north of London.
""Using your mobile device you select some products, put them into your basket on your device and then just walk out of the store,"" Steven Blair, Tesco's convenience transformation director told reporters.
""The feedback is very good on it but it's super early,"" said Blair.
U.S. giant Amazon (O:AMZN) opened a checkout-free grocery store in Seattle to the public in January, moving forward on an experiment that could dramatically alter bricks-and-mortar retail.
The Seattle store, known as Amazon Go, relies on cameras and sensors to track what shoppers remove from the shelves, and what they put back. Cash registers and checkout lines become superfluous - customers are billed after leaving the store using credit cards on file.
Tesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis said although the Welwyn trial was scalable, security implications had to be considered as there was a danger of increased product theft.
""If the margin in the business is 2 or 3 percent, you don't have to lose much to make it unprofitable,"" he said.
The Welwyn store is also cashless, cutting the time spent on customer transactions.
Blair said the store was serving customers at its checkouts in about 45 seconds, versus 90 seconds for a similar sized store in the estate.

He noted that some Tesco convenience stores in Britain were already down to just 20 percent of payments by cash, making a cashless roll-out likely in the future.

The new board, dominated by independent directors and operational managers, is part of a series of steps which Rusal and its co-owner Oleg Deripaska hope will persuade the U.S. government to remove the company from sanctions that have damaged its business since April. 
Rusal has felt the impact of the U.S. sanctions because of its entanglement with Deripaska, but the U.S. government is not targeting the hardworking people who depend on Rusal, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in April, when Washington extended a deadline for Rusal sanctions.
At an annual general meeting in Hong Kong, where Rusal shares are listed, its shareholders elected to the board those it hopes will be seen by the U.S. as the hardworking people it referred to - its operational and regional managers and independent directors.
Deripaska and a team of his top managers stepped down from Rusal's board of directors in May and are currently working on several options to reduce his control over the company. 
Deripaska controls 66 percent of En+ Group, which in turn controls 48 percent of Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer outside China.
The new board of 12 directors includes six independent directors, three non-executive directors and three executive directors, Rusal said in a statement.
The latter are Evgeny Nikitin, Rusal acting chief executive who was the head of its aluminum division previously; Sergey Popov, Rusal's representative in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, where some of the company's smelters are located; and Evgeniy Vavilov, the senior master of Rusal's foundry directorate in Krasnoyarsk.

Rusal shares finished up 1.5 percent in Hong Kong on Thursday, outperforming a 0.5 percent growth in the benchmark index.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Australia triumphed on Thursday in a major trade dispute over its pioneering ""plain"" tobacco packaging law with World Trade Organization judges rejecting arguments brought by Cuba, Indonesia, Honduras and Dominican Republic. 
The WTO panel ruled that the Australian law contributed to improving public health by reducing the use of and exposure to tobacco products, rebuffing claims that alternative measures would be equally effective.
The ruling, which is expected to be appealed, also rejected the complainants' argument that Australia's law unjustifiably infringed tobacco trademarks and violated intellectual property rights. 
The WTO case was seen as a test case for public health legislation globally, and could lead to tighter marketing rules for unhealthy foods and alcohol as well as tobacco. 
""Tobacco plain packaging is an evidence-based measure that WHO recommends as part of a comprehensive approach to tobacco control,"" WTO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Thursday. ""A positive decision from the WTO panel is likely to accelerate global implementation."" 
Australia's law goes much further than advertising bans and graphic health warnings seen in other countries. 
Introduced in 2010, it bans logos and distinctively-colored cigarette packaging in favor of drab olive packets that look more like military or prison issue, with brand names printed in small standardized fonts.
Cuba, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Indonesia complained at the WTO that the Australian rules constituted an illegal barrier to trade. Ukraine was also among the complainants but dropped out after a change of government in Kiev.
Tobacco firms have said the law infringes their trademarks and that the easily counterfeited packs will encourage smuggling, although they are not involved in the WTO case.
Tobacco giant Philip Morris declined to comment on Thursday as it is not party to the dispute. 
Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, said it was a huge day for tobacco control. She cited the WTO ruling and noted that a protocol to halt tobacco smuggling had taken effect. 
She also saw a ""domino effect"" in plain packaging, with other countries already moving toward Australian-style rules.
""What this shows in reality is that plain packaging is a reality. It will happen anyway, and parties will progressively adhere more to plain packaging,"" da Costa e Silva told Reuters. 
Some countries were now discussing a tobacco ""endgame"", with less than 5 percent of the population smoking, she said, adding: ""Plain packaging is part of this path."" 
The expected appeal of the WTO ruling leaves the dispute's eventual outcome uncertain since the WTO may run out of judges next year due to U.S. President Donald Trump's veto on new judicial appointments.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) said on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw will retire at the end of November, stunning investors and sending shares of the world's largest coffee shop chain down more than 4 percent.
Maw, 50, lasted just four years in the CFO role, and the company did not provide details on what prompted the retirement. 
Starbucks had strong sales growth and topped analyst earnings estimates during the first half of Maw's tenure but stumbled more recently, with the company’s chief executive earlier this month calling its performance “not acceptable.”
The Seattle-based company said in a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000119312518206726/d802843d8k.htm that it has launched an external search for a replacement for Maw, who will become a senior consultant until March 31, 2019, earning $250,000 per month. 
""As we enter our next phase of continued growth, I am confident in the finance team Scott has developed and am appreciative of his willingness to support through the transition into new leadership,"" Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in a statement. 
It was Starbucks' second high-profile departure announced in recent weeks. Earlier this month, co-founder Executive Chairman Howard Schultz said he would step away from the company, effective this week.
Analysts were stunned by Maw's retirement, pointing to his relatively young age and short stint as CFO. Some described him as a competent executive, but also noted the chain's deteriorating performance and outlook in recent quarters.
""We believe the departure of Mr. Maw - who we viewed as a capable leader – will be perceived be as a loss for SBUX in the near and long-term,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a research note. 
Maw was promoted to CFO in February 2014, and his first two years in the role were marked by a pickup in comparable store sales growth and Starbucks consistently topping Wall Street earnings forecasts. 
But the coffee chain fell short of analyst estimates for same-store sales in the Americas region in five of the last six quarters.
Last week it forecast slower sales growth than expected this quarter and said it plans to shutter about 150 U.S. cafes next fiscal year, triple its normal number of closures.
""The sudden nature of this announcement and Maw's relatively young age and tenure in his role suggest the decision (to) leave was perhaps not entirely voluntary,"" Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note.

""While a new CFO may bring greater experience in the types of capital allocation strategies we have advocated, the fundamentals of the business need to at least stabilize and the responsibility for that lies with SBUX’s CEO and COO.""

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>","Walgreens plays down Amazon pharmacy entry, but investors spooked","By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's (O:WBA) chief executive officer said on Thursday he was not worried about Amazon.Com Inc's (O:AMZN) push into the U.S. healthcare sector, but investors were rattled by the threat the online giant could pose to the sector.
Walgreens' shares fell as much as 11 percent, overshadowing the company's better-than-expected quarterly results and a $10 billion buyback, amid a broad selloff among drug retailers and wholesalers after Amazon said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack.
""You see, the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,"" CEO Stefano Pessina said on a post-earnings call that was dominated by discussions around Amazon's foray.
""We are not particularly worried,"" Pessina said, but added that the company was not complacent either.
In its first earnings report as a member of the bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), Walgreens posted a 19.3 percent rise in U.S. pharmacies sales due to higher prescription volumes at Rite Aid stores.
Walgreens bought some of Rite Aid Corp's (N:RAD) U.S. stores last year after scrapping its deal to buy the smaller rival outright.
However, the retail segment continued to be a drag on its results, with same-store sales in the business falling 3.8 percent.
""CVS (N:CVS) and Walgreens have become particularly reliant on the pharmacy side to drive their businesses forward,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, calling it a ""folly"" to not invest in retail.
""This now means that the retail side of the business is largely incapable of driving footfall into stores which could help support the prescription and pharmacy side of the business.""
Walgreens said same-store sales at its U.S. pharmacies were unchanged in the quarter. The average expectation was for a 3.7 percent rise, according to eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.53 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $1.48.
The company's total sales rose 14 percent to $34.33 billion, edging past the average analyst estimate of $34.05 billion.

Walgreens also authorized a $10 billion share buyback and increased its quarterly dividend by 10 percent to 44 cents per share.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",British lawmaker eyes tribunal to help small firms challenge banks,"By Sinead Cruise and Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - Small businesses that are victims of fraud, conspiracy and misconduct by British banks could soon be able to sue their lenders in a tribunal dedicated to helping them bring banks to justice without fear of financial ruin.
The proposal comes amid ongoing fallout from two of Britain's biggest corporate lending scandals; namely the uncovering of systematic mistreatment of troubled borrowers by Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) turnaround unit and a major fraud at Lloyds Banking Group's (L:LLOY) HBOS Reading division, which saw six people jailed last year. 
British lawmaker Kevin Hollinrake, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Fair Business Banking, told Reuters that the APPG would propose the tribunal, likely funded by the banks themselves, in a report in July. 
It would offer a recourse for small businesses which currently have few options if they are dissatisfied with remedies or compensation offered by the banks. 
One current option is to appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which will only accept complaints from businesses with turnover of under 2 million pounds ($2.62 million) and fewer than 10 employees. It can only compel financial services firms to pay compensation up to 150,000 pounds.
The second is to take lenders to court - a route that can be slow and financially painful.
Hundreds of small firms were affected by scandals at Lloyds and RBS, with some losing their businesses and livelihoods. Many victims felt their complaints were never properly remedied by the banks or the authorities supposed to keep them in check.
Both lenders set up redress schemes to compensate customers. RBS apologized for the misconduct of its staff and Lloyds hired a retired judge to see whether its management could have handled the fraud better.
""We must address a lack of accountability at the banks in order to restore trust in the financial system and serve as a deterrent to those who break the rules,"" Hollinrake said.
He said small businesses - often seen as the engine of the British economy - are becoming increasingly reluctant to borrow from traditional lenders, even it means crimping their business prospects and limiting overall economic growth.
ALTERNATIVES
Hollinrake's proposals would require new legislation, but he said under the current system banks end up acting as judge, jury and criminal in many compensation claims. 
""They have vast resources at their disposal to manage and crush legal threats. Customers know they can only contest unsatisfactory damages if they have millions of pounds to spare,"" Hollinrake said.
Britain's four biggest lenders told Reuters they agreed the system needed reform, while trade body UK Finance has also commissioned an independent review into possible alternatives, due to be published later this year. 
A spokesman for Lloyds said the bank was open minded about possible options while RBS said it would consider any proposals. 
""We are committed to rebuilding SME trust and confidence in banking and recognize that, as part of this, it is essential that SMEs have access to dispute resolution options that they can have confidence in and which can be relied upon to deliver inexpensive, unbiased and prompt decisions,"" the RBS spokesman said.
But UK Finance,  Barclays  (L:BARC) and HSBC (L:HSBA) said they would rather back an extension of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) proposed by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.
This would allow the FOS to accept complaints from firms with turnover of under 6.5 million pounds, and fewer than 50 employees. The FCA is currently consulting on the proposals.
""The most important thing is to have a system that SMEs can trust, that is easy to use and cheap to access, and which reaches decisions quickly and efficiently,"" Ian Rand, chief executive of business banking at Barclays said.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 11:37AM ET</span>",LVMH cuts ties with Bono's ethical fashion brand Edun,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) is parting ways with the eco-friendly Edun label started by singer Bono and his wife Ali Hewson, transferring its minority stake back to the founders as the firm winds down its U.S. operations.
LVMH said Edun was ""restructuring its operations in preparation for its next chapter"" following a joint review of the business.
""The founders remain committed to Edun's mission for sustainable fashion,"" a joint statement sent by LVMH said. 
The company, which was based out of New York, will cease operations in the United States and already shut down its one store there in May, a source close to the firm said, confirming a report by website Business of Fashion.
Edun also sold its wares online and through 15 other outlets, although the current collection produced for spring and summer will be its last, while the label decides how to take the business forward, the source added. 
Edun, headquartered in Ireland for financial matters, had been in the red for several years, filings with the Irish companies registry showed. It made a $6.3 million loss in 2016, according to the latest available accounts, with accumulated losses reaching $80.6 million. 
The business is a very small part of the LVMH portfolio, which includes multi-billion euro brands such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and also drinks companies such as champagne maker Moet & Chandon. 
But LVMH's 2009 investment - for an undisclosed sum - underscored a move by big luxury groups toward promoting more sustainable fashion, an area they have since been building up. 
Edun, launched in 2004, works with weavers and clothing workshops in Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa to help promote fair trade, and aims to source materials in an eco-friendly way, using recycled fabrics for instance.
The company is financed by shareholder loans, according to its filings for the 2016 financial year, which showed its net liabilities stood at $57 million. Shareholders had agreed to not seek repayment of their loans ""for the foreseeable future"", according to the documents. 

Irish singer Bono, the lead singer of rock band U2 whose real name is Paul Hewson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Under the settlement, Visa, Mastercard and a number of banks that issue debit and credit cards, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Citigroup Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), would pay the merchants around $6.5 billion, the report said.
It is not clear how the payment would be split up among the card networks and the issuing banks, according to the report.
MasterCard said in a regulatory filing it would boost its reserve by about $210 million in the second quarter to account for claims related to a lawsuit with merchants.
However, it was not clear if the estimated increase in reserve was related to the settlement that the WSJ reported.
On Tuesday, Visa said in filing it allocated $600 million into a litigation account of the bank, but did not say if the amount is related to the settlement with the merchants. 

Mastercard and JPMorgan were not immediately available to comment on the settlement.  Citigroup  and Bank of America declined to comment.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",BJ's Wholesale Club shares shine in return to public market,"(Reuters) - Shares of BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings (N:BJ) jumped 26.5 percent on their market debut on Thursday, giving the company a valuation of $2.72 billion.
The wholesale retailer sold 37.5 million shares in its IPO, raising net proceeds of $637.5 million which it intends to use to primarily repay debt.
The company's shares opened at $21.25, over its pricing of $17 a share.
BJ's Wholesale Club, which has 215 warehouses spanning 16 states, closely competes with Costco Wholesale (O:COST) and Sam's Club, a unit of Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
The company was taken private by equity firms Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital in 2011 for $2.8 billion.
Currently, CVC and Green Equity each own 34.5 percent stake in the company.
The Westborough, Massachusetts-headquartered company recorded net sales of $12.50 billion for fiscal year 2018, up 3.3 percent from FY ended 2017. Total net income was $50.3 million, up 13.7 percent from an year earlier.
BJ's IPO will be the second retail listing in 2018 after airport concession operator  Hudson Ltd  (N:HUD) and comes at a time when brick and mortar retailers are struggling as consumers spend more of their dollars online.
Warehouse club operators, however, have largely bucked the downturn as their business models rely more on recurring membership revenues than just top line sales.
BJ's Wholesale Club said it had over five million paid members, as of Feb 3. In comparison, Costco had nearly 51 million paid members as of May 13, 2018, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan are leading a 14-firm underwriting syndicate for the retailer's IPO.

A possible tax-free spinoff would create two separately traded public companies to unlock value for the businesses, MSG said on Wednesday.
""This proposed transaction would provide each company with enhanced strategic flexibility, its own defined business focus and clear investment characteristics,"" said Chief Executive Officer James Dolan, who is expected to be the chairman and CEO of both the companies.
The sports entity will house the New York Knicks and New York Rangers professional sports franchises, while the live entertainment company will include all owned concert-hosting venues such as New York's Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall as well as nightclubs owned by the TAO Group.
Jefferies raised its rating on MSG to ""buy"" from ""hold"" and also increased the price target by $117 to $350, with MSG Sports worth $133 and MSG Entertainment $217.
""MSG possesses a collection of unique, world class sports and entertainment assets which are largely underappreciated by investors,"" Jefferies analyst John Janedis wrote in a client note, adding that the spinoff is expected to better reflect the intrinsic value of the assets.
TAO Group owns restaurant and nightclubs with over 20 venues in New York, Las Vegas and Sydney.
The entertainment business has been driving growth at MSG in the last few quarters. Revenue from this segment more than doubled in the quarter ended March 31 to $159.6 million, while sports fell 3 percent to $300 million.

Shares of MSG, which have climbed nearly 40 percent this year, were last up 11.6 percent at $297.22.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Workers can shield German conglomerates from GE-style breakups,"By Edward Taylor and Alexander Hübner
FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - The breakup of  General Electric  (N:GE) announced this week has put pressure on German conglomerates to consider similar moves, but executives must take account of the labor unions on their boards who have the power to veto radical plans. 
GE said it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil services company  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) following months of shareholder pressure to overhaul its conglomerate structure.
This increases pressure on German firms to speed up their own strategy overhauls, but they will have a harder time pulling off far-reaching reforms proposed by shareholders unless they can win over powerful labor leaders.
This makes partial listings more likely than complete breakups for Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) truck business,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW's (DE:BMWG) joint mobility division - which includes car-sharing and electric vehicle charging - and some of Continental's (DE:CONG) businesses such as powertrains and sensors, bankers and executives said.
Radical moves can be blocked by German labor representatives, who command half the seats on the supervisory boards of large corporations, giving them the power to quash strategic moves that could leave a company vulnerable to a hostile takeover or result in job losses.
The success of Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) planned steel joint venture with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) in Europe, for example, hinges on labor approval, even as activist investors push for deeper reforms at the submarines-to-elevators group.
 Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) listed its healthcare business and agreed to combine its rail operations with French rival  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), but only because labor reps agreed that a merged Franco-German rail company can better compete with Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CRRC in the long run.
CONGLOMERATE DISCOUNT
Specialized businesses are often more highly valued than conglomerates because in times of growth, high-potential assets do not have to share the balance sheet with lower-return businesses.
""The advantages from having a diversified conglomerate, for funding purposes for example, are not as pronounced as the valuation discount on conglomerates through complex structures,"" said Alexander Mayer, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner in investment banking in Germany.
""Companies are more vulnerable to takeovers or become targets of activist investors if they are burdened with a conglomerate discount,"" Mayer said.
Firms which have reshaped their portfolios through spin-offs and divestments have outperformed their competitors, Goldman Sachs said, a trend which helped asset divestments in Europe reach their highest level since 2007.
LABOR WARNING
But German labor leaders warn that splitting up the country's conglomerates could leave some high-tech divisions small enough to be snapped up by a Chinese rival or become embroiled in a hostile takeover by a financial investor, as happened to British engineering group GKN (LON:GKN) .
Juergen Kerner, a management board member of Germany's biggest trade union IG Metall, said: ""Breakups are a dangerous way forward.""
The benefits of slimming down have been eroded with the emergence of newly assertive Chinese rivals and technology companies which are not as enthusiastic about such strategies as some activist shareholders, Kerner said.
""Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are all diversifying,"" Kerner said, explaining that these software companies are now dabbling in areas like autonomous vehicles, drones and food delivery. 
Chinese, Korean and Japanese conglomerates too remain diversified, which gives them the scale to more easily rebuff takeovers and handle a downturn.
Exposure to several businesses with different growth, margin and cash flow generation rates is still an advantage when the economy tanks in one particular sector, Kerner said.
Specialized companies have fewer ways to cut costs, putting them under pressure to squeeze their suppliers, which could damage the engineering expertise they depend on.
The more specialized companies become, the harder it will be to preserve this supply chain, Kerner said. Germany still has a thriving sector of small and medium-sized companies which serve global conglomerates, he said. Debt rating agencies agree.
In May, Moody's, in note about auto suppliers, warned that separating stable, cash-generating businesses from high-growth, cash-consuming operations could damage their credit ratings because of ""smaller scale and reduced diversification"". 
Bankers say reforms at German conglomerates can only succeed if labor leaders are convinced of the industrial logic. 
It is not enough simply to say that shareholder value can be created via a breakup, Christian Kames, JP Morgan's head of investment banking in Germany, told Reuters.
""The discussion needs to begin with whether it is the right step from a strategic point of view,"" Kames told Reuters.
CHINESE RIVALS
A complicating factor is China's new assertiveness in buying up high-tech businesses at a time when Germany lacks regulatory tools to fend off unwanted takeovers. 
Washington has the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review whether a foreign person can gain control over a U.S. business, but Germany does not have similar protectionist tools. 
Chinese buyers bought robot maker Kuka and Geely chairman Li Shufu took a 9 percent stake in Daimler. Li used derivatives to mask his purchase until the last minute, prompting CDU lawmaker Hans Michelbach to demand that the German regulator take action. 
Germany is now reviewing how to tighten disclosure rules to prevent another ""sneak attack"". 
""We would welcome everything which reduces uncertainty in the area of approval processes for international transactions,"" Goldman Sachs' Mayer told Reuters. 

""You need to be able to estimate what works and what does not,"" Mayer said.

PillPack's business is built around customers who take multiple daily prescriptions. It offers medications in pre-sorted dose packaging, coordinates refills, and handles shipments.
The deal — for which terms were not immediately disclosed — marks Amazon's latest push into the healthcare industry. In January, the company announced a collaboration with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) to reduce healthcare costs for US workers.
""PillPack’s visionary team has a combination of deep pharmacy experience and a focus on technology,"" Jeff Wilke, Amazon's CEO of worldwide consumer said in a release. ""PillPack is meaningfully improving its customers' lives, and we want to help them continue making it easy for people to save time, simplify their lives, and feel healthier.""
Pharmacy stocks in the US market dropped on the deal announcement, most notably CVS (-8.1%), Rite Aid (-3.1%), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) (-9.2%).
The damage also spread throughout the entire pharmacy supply chain, with drug wholesalers seeing deep losses.  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), McKesson (NYSE:MCK), and Express Scripts all dropped more than 3% on the news.
Pharmacy shareholders will perhaps find solace in the fact that they're not the only industry to have billions in market value erased by one simple Amazon announcement. It's a trend that's been playing out repeatedly over the past year, with grocery stores, athletic apparel retailers, and package-delivery services among the afflicted groups.
The reasoning is simple — Amazon has a ton of cash and an unparalleled logistical network, and when it looks poised to enter or expand its position in a market, traders get scared and bail out of existing holdings in other companies.
And if Amazon's torrid stock performance in recent months is any indication, the company's shareholders love the deal activity, among other fundamental drivers. The firm's shares have spiked 435% since the beginning of 2015, more than 14 times the return for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period.

1212,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Hedge Fund That Made 6,000% on VIX Jump Bets on Next Blow-Up","(Bloomberg) -- A hedge fund that reaped an outrageous gain in February’s vol-mageddon is eyeing a fresh target.
Houndstooth Capital Management LLC secured a 6,000 percent return from a bearish bet on an exchange-traded product tied to calm markets.
Now, the $7.5 million fund sees trouble in an ETF designed to profit from the opposite -- turbulence in stocks. It’s wagering technical forces in the volatility complex will help spur a swift return to stability in the wake of a blowout, undoing the leveraged product in its wake.
It goes like this: Even though Houndstooth expects another surge in price swings, it’s using out-of-the-money puts with near-term maturities to bet against the $413 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. UVXY, as it is known, is one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that profit from rising volatility. The theory is that after an initial spike there will be a snapback in vol that will decimate the product.
“We’re looking for areas where buying or selling volatility is mispriced by the market, or at least where we think there’s a very good risk-reward trade-off,” Lincoln Edwards, founder at Houndstooth, said in an interview. “There’s a risk that another massive VIX spike could destroy UVXY in a single day.”
Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares at Hewes Communications, declined to comment.
The capital behind the trade is modest, but it highlights the contentious issue of whether securities such as UVXY can exert an outsize pull on the very contracts they track, exacerbating their own volatility in the process.
Hot Summer
Volatility investing has boomed in recent years as ETPs offered cheap and liquid ways for professional money managers and retail investors to punt on the burgeoning asset class. As Wall Street warns of a “hot” summer full of risk, and a more normal regime for volatility after two placid years, many traders are betting on bigger price swings in the latter half of the year.
And that’s how Houndstooth made its spectacular February return. The Austin, Texas-based firm bought put options on the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, or SVXY, thinking that an upward move in the Cboe Volatility Index would shake sellers out of their torpor. Sure enough, the gauge staged a record-one day spike, sending the ETF plummeting 83 percent -- and handing the fund its best-ever first quarter with a double-digit gain.
Houndstooth reckons it has a keen eye for technical risks in the underbelly of the volatility complex. Since the VIX isn’t tradable, many products hold futures contracts on the gauge. Given their size, some participants say they can exert a large pull on the price of the assets they track, underscored by the spectacular collapse of ETNs linked to calm markets in February.
Both long and short products buy and sell futures contracts on a daily basis to maintain their desired degree of exposure to implied equity volatility. That means a large one-way move in the VIX can dramatically increase the number of contracts they need to buy -- challenging liquidity and potentially driving the price of futures higher, according to Edwards.
Cboe Global Markets Inc. didn’t immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. It has recently outlined changes to the monthly auction for the VIX settlement.
Scenarios
For the Houndstooth strategy to pay off, VIX futures need to lose two-thirds of their value in a single day. That, in theory, would be enough to send the price of the 1.5-times leveraged UVXY to zero.
“Even if VIX futures gained 200 percent or even 10,000 percent in a single day, a one-day decline of 66 percent makes UVXY worth $0 regardless of how high it climbed,” Edwards said.
Of course, the grip ETFs assert on VIX futures likely diminished after February, as products either closed or shrank, while several ProShares ETFs reduced leverage, including UVXY, curbing their need to rebalance after sharp moves.
And the scenario didn’t play out after the VIX’s record spike on Feb. 5. The next day, the volatility gauge slumped by one-fifth -- only enough to send UVXY down by a third for the day.
Still, buying put options on the ETF rather than shorting it allows Houndstooth to limit potential losses on the trade, and there are a few scenarios that could lead to its success.
Under one, the VIX spikes from its current level to 40. The next day, as panic eases, the gauge knifes back down, its movements exacerbated by long buyers rushing to cover positions, and by volatility products flooding the futures market to rebalance holdings.
In another, the VIX could surge on bad-news speculation and then quickly reverse, producing a large enough intraday spike for the bet to pay off. Alternatively, the gauge could gradually climb higher -- only to deflate suddenly if favorable news emerges.
Edwards believes volatility is poised to move higher as November’s U.S. congressional elections approach.
“We’ll also see a third interest-rate hike, which will spark much more volatility than what we’re seeing now. Political uncertainty in Europe will continue causing major fits of volatility. Expect to see the VIX over 30 at least one more time this year,” he said.
The Houndstooth investor concedes that a 6,000 percent return on the strategy is a tail scenario -- but one “that’s massively underappreciated and underpriced.”

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>","Special Report: As Mexico oil sector sputters, crime and violence rattle industry towns","By Gabriel Stargardter
PARAISO, Mexico (Reuters) - Until recently, Edgar Barrera enjoyed a life many Mexicans could only hope for.
In a few short years, the 36-year-old bookkeeper rose from handyman to white-collar worker at what seemed to be one of the most stable companies in Latin America: state-owned oil firm Pemex.
Thanks to Pemex, Barrera met his wife, vacationed on the Mayan Riviera and envisaged a rewarding career without leaving his hometown in Tabasco, a rural state at the southern hook of the Gulf of Mexico where more than half the population lives on less than roughly $92 a month.
Then everything changed.
Oil prices plummeted, forcing Pemex to cut his and thousands of other jobs across Mexico. An energy reform, meant to spur business with private competitors, struggled to attract immediate investment. And the gang violence that has crippled Mexico over the last decade finally spread to Tabasco, previously a relatively peaceful corner of the country.
Mounting consequences, from an economic recession to soaring murder rates, have rapidly made Tabasco one of Mexico's most troubled states. Its small, but once seemingly solid, middle-class now struggles with a downturn and lurid violence.
Barrera himself, after brushes with extortionists and kidnappers who may have once been Pemex colleagues, recently sought asylum in Canada.
Paraiso, or ""paradise,"" is the Tabasco town where Barrera grew up and worked at a Pemex port. It is ""now a hell,"" he said.
It's little surprise that industry turbulence would hurt Tabasco, home to Mexico's first petroleum discovery and a state where more than half the economy, and nearly half the jobs, rely on the oil sector.
But the extent of the problems has caught locals, industry executives and government officials off guard, especially as criminals increasingly exploit what's left of any prosperity by targeting Pemex resources, equipment and employees. 
""The oil debacle hit us hard,"" said Tabasco Governor Arturo Nunez. ""It caused social problems that without question are contributing to higher crime.""
President Enrique Pena Nieto, now in his last year in office, made an overhaul of the energy industry his signature initiative, ending Pemex's longstanding grip on exploration, production, refining and retail fuel sales. Proponents long argued that operators besides Pemex are needed to reverse more than a decade of declining crude output and unlock potential in untapped deposits.
But the reform, finalized in 2014, came into law just as global oil prices collapsed, dampening companies' willingness to invest. Despite a recent rebound, the price of crude in global markets plummeted by as much as 76 percent as of June of that year.
Since then, Pemex has slashed nearly 18,000 jobs across Mexico, about 13 percent of its workforce, according to company figures. In Tabasco, Pemex let go 1,857 workers, or roughly 12 percent of the 16,000 jobs the state shed between 2014 and 2016, according to government data. Many of the other layoffs were among suppliers and other businesses that rely on Pemex. 
Combined, the cutbacks gave Tabasco Mexico's highest unemployment rate and mired the state in recession. In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, Tabasco's economy shrank by 6.3 percent. It is the only state where both poverty and extreme poverty, defined by the government as monthly income of less than about $50, have risen in recent years.
Compounding troubles nationwide, the woes have eroded support ahead of a July 1 presidential election for Pena Nieto's successor as the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Instead, a leftist former Mexico City mayor – and native son of Tabasco – dominates polls. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the 64-year-old frontrunner, promises to build a refinery in his home state. 
Although Pemex has recently begun to hire back a few workers, other companies have been reluctant to invest in states like Tabasco, where oil production is now nearly 70 percent below a peak in the early 1990s. With supply abundant worldwide, and an ever-growing flow of crude from U.S. shale, would-be investors are wary of Mexico's crime, corruption and violence.
""We decided not to start,"" said Javier Lopez, a Texas-based attorney who recently scrapped plans to launch a business trucking fuel from the United States into Mexico. ""We really were afraid we'd get a truck stolen, a driver killed.""
For more than a decade, Mexico's government has deployed police, the military and intelligence forces to topple powerful drug kingpins. As they fell, cartels morphed and moved into new rackets, including theft and extortion of businesses in industries from agriculture to mining and oil.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported how fuel thieves are crippling Mexico's refineries and unleashing bloodshed in formerly calm centers of Pemex operations.
In Tabasco, police registered 388 murders last year, over triple the number in 2012. Despite a population of 2.4 million people, small compared with many of Mexico's 30 other states and giant capital district, Tabasco had the fourth-highest kidnapping tally and sixth-highest number of extortions reported last year.
Current and former Pemex workers are at both ends of the crimes – some as victims but others as instigators, participants or informants. Emboldened by the impunity and graft that have enabled crime nationwide, some locals have turned to illicit businesses, joining or seeking to start gangs that steal Pemex fuel, machinery and supplies. Others are targeting relatively well-off current and former Pemex workers, such as Barrera.
In a statement, Pemex said it ""has zero tolerance with any worker involved in any crime."" The company said it cooperates with local, state and federal police to investigate illegal activity, but declined to comment on specific episodes or cases involving individual workers mentioned in this story. 
During a recent interview, Carlos Trevino, Pemex's chief executive, conceded that employees are increasingly at risk because of their jobs and pay. ""Petroleros have a better salary than many other people,"" he said, using the Spanish term for oil industry workers.
Across Mexico, Trevino added, the company is increasing measures to ensure the security of personnel and property. It has taken its name and logo off trucks. It told workers to stop wearing Pemex uniforms off site.
Still, he said, ""it's hard to have a completely safe operation.""
""This thing in Tabasco,"" he added, ""it's not good."" 
CRUDE HISTORY
Mexico's first known oil discovery took place in Tabasco in 1863. Manuel Gil y Saenz, a priest, was rushing to see his ill mother when his horse's hoof got stuck in black sludge, according to a local history of the find.
Despite warnings by natives that a witch there turned people into salt, the priest returned and began tapping the oil. With partners, he later sold his venture to a British oil company.
In 1938, Mexico expropriated foreign-owned oil assets and created Petroleos Mexicanos, as Pemex is formally known. Over the following decades, production grew in other regions along the Gulf coast. In 1972 prospectors found a giant deposit known as the Mesozoic Chiapas-Tabasco oilfield, prompting a rush to develop the state.
To handle growing output from Tabasco, Pemex in 1979 began building the Dos Bocas port and terminal in Paraiso, a hot, marshy town of 94,000 people surrounded by cacao and coconut plantations.
For locals, who previously subsisted on small-scale agriculture and fishing, ""Pemex came and changed our lives,"" said Ricardo Hernandez Daza, head of a local union of roughly 3,000 workers who staff many industry sites.
Barrera, the auditor now seeking asylum, joined Pemex in 2004. 
That year, the country's oil output reached a record high and opportunities seemed boundless. Mexico was one of many producers poised to benefit from steadily climbing prices as the global industry, before the shale boom, faced ""peak oil,"" the assumption that most of the world's supply was known and diminishing.
First hired as a maintenance worker, Barrera worked his way up through other positions, got on-the-job training and eventually began reviewing company accounts for a salary of about $2,000 a month. He married a fellow Pemex auditor, bought two cars and enjoyed regular seafood outings with his wife, their daughter and two stepsons.
Until oil prices plunged.
Barrera weathered initial Pemex layoffs, but in November 2015 was let go. He immediately sought other jobs, but with many others already scrambling for work, he found only occasional freelance assignments.
Soon, Paraiso was reeling.
Two brothers, Mario and Pedro Maciel, emerged as local crime bosses, according to state prosecutors. Rumors swirled they had set up a branch of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, known for drug trafficking, fuel theft and countless other crimes across Mexico. 
Some Gulf of Mexico oil workers, many of whom come from inland states, were already getting extorted by the cartel on trips into Jalisco New Generation territory.
Alayn Herver, a 28-year-old native of the central state from which the cartel took its name, until last year worked on offshore oil rigs that dot the Tabasco shoreline. Because of the intense schedules required there, Herver would spend two weeks on the rigs and then two weeks on leave back home in Jalisco. 
In October 2016, while in a bar in his hometown of Ciudad Guzman, a stranger approached him and demanded roughly $1,000, about half his monthly salary. ""We know you earn well,"" the man said. ""Do you want something to happen to you?""
At first, Herver thought the man was joking. Outside, though, some of the man's colleagues awaited in an SUV, ready to take him to an ATM. Herver realized they were members of the Jalisco cartel.
He paid the men, who told him a similar payoff would be expected each month. For half a year, Herver complied. The transaction became so routine that the gang members appeared to lose interest.
Herver didn't report the extortion. Like many Mexicans, he was wary of widespread corruption in police ranks and feared they would only make matters worse.
The following April, he decided to skip a payment.
On his next trip home, in May 2017, local police pulled him over, Herver said. They handcuffed him and put him in their patrol car. ""You've got yourself into trouble,"" he recalled one officer telling him.
Alejandro Romero, a senior officer with the Ciudad Guzman police force, declined to comment on the incident. The Jalisco state attorney general's office didn't respond to requests for comment. 
As another policeman followed in Herver's car, a 2007 Mini Cooper, the officers drove to a spot near the city dump, he said. There, six armed men, including the gang member who first approached him, pummeled Herver.
""Pull his pants down,"" one of the gangsters said.
They beat his bare buttocks with a paddle and repeatedly threatened to rape him. One of the assailants put a gun to his head, while another grabbed his cell phone and began posting live video to Herver's own Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) feed.
Horrified, friends and family watched, the raw footage shifting from Herver's drained expression to close-ups of his bloody behind.
""I thought they were going to kill me,"" Herver said.
Instead, they let him go, keeping the Mini as payment.
""A PIECE OF THE ACTION""
In Paraiso, the Maciel brothers denied connections to the cartel or any such crimes. They published an open letter on Facebook stating they were law-abiding citizens.
""We are a family,"" they wrote in the letter, ""dedicated to its work for Pemex at Dos Bocas,"" the port.
A worker named Pedro Maciel did, in fact, work for Pemex in Tabasco as recently as 2017, according to a database of company workers reviewed by Reuters. Mario's name didn't appear in the registry.
For locals, the brothers' reassurances made little difference. 
It was already apparent that a Pemex job wasn't what it once was. Others besides the Maciel brothers were suspected across Paraiso of using their oil-industry positions as perches from which to steal fuel, extort workers and commit other crimes.
Those familiar with the industry say it makes sense that criminals, not just victims, could emerge from the Pemex payroll. Even if not committing atrocities themselves, some employees are believed to cooperate with gangs for their own cut of the proceeds or, merely, out of fear.
""They know the guts of the place, so they can provide information,"" said Raul Munoz, a former Pemex chief executive, who now has private business with the company in Tabasco and says he faces regular security problems. ""Everyone wants a piece of the action.""
Barrera, the auditor, and his family soon were swept up in the action. Last October, kidnappers captured a brother-in-law. Days before, after three decades of Pemex service, he had received a retirement bonus of roughly $20,000.
Within days, the family cobbled together a ransom of about $30,000. The kidnappers released him. With contact information stolen from his telephone, though, they began calling friends and family, demanding more.
The brother-in-law declined to speak with Reuters about the kidnapping. 
Like Herver, the family opted not to go to the police.
""Pemex's workforce is contaminated,"" Barrera said, echoing family members who believe the kidnapping was planned with inside information. ""The workers are feasting on one another.""
Last November, Barrera secured a few weeks' work as a Pemex contractor. The threats grew closer.
A colleague told Barrera's wife, who still works at Pemex, that suspicious men had been asking about her outside the office gates. Colleagues then told Barrera that armed men were waiting outside the office for him, too.
Terrified, he slept in the office that night.
Enough, he thought.
Barrera booked a ticket to Canada, where Mexicans can travel with no visa. He landed in Toronto last Christmas and applied for asylum. He hopes to bring his family, who moved to Villahermosa, Tabasco's capital, in order to avoid the gangsters in Paraiso.
Herver, the rig worker whose beating was streamed live on Facebook, also fled to Canada.
""I was doing well at Pemex,"" he said. But after the assault, ""my only alternative was to leave.""
He, too, applied for asylum.
A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada declined to comment on either case, citing privacy laws. 
On January 31, coordinated shootings erupted overnight across Paraiso.
Among the dead: the Maciel brothers. Local prosecutors said they were killed in a fuel-theft dispute. Their assassins, prosecutors added, died two months later in a shootout with police.
Even what should be legitimate business is getting more violent. 
Daza, the local union boss, said his sprawling collective of construction, welding, tubing and other laborers has grown aggressive to protect its share of dwindling oil work. The union is one of many independent labor groups that represent workers and compete with one another for industry jobs.
Among other tactics, he admits to assaulting rival union members to keep them from job sites. They wield baseball bats, not firearms or knives, to avoid felony charges, he said. 
When strangers in out-of-state rental cars arrive in Paraiso, the union and others like it send members to their hotel to demand work at whatever project they're planning. If they don't deliver, the unions sometimes shut sites down.
The tactics are not out of the ordinary in a country and industry where corrupt labor leaders are known to bribe both companies and members in exchange for keeping positions filled.
But they have also fueled job losses. 
Because of the unions' demands, oil services companies Oro Negro and Constructora y Perforadora Latina left, depriving Paraiso of 300 jobs, according to a local newspaper report. Neither of the companies, based in Mexico City, responded to requests for comment. 

Daza said he has little choice but to use force at a time when the oil business is both the root of Paraiso's problems and its only hope of recovery. ""We're in danger of extinction,"" Daza said. ""If nobody comes to save us, we're screwed.""

FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) is expected to start exclusive talks shortly over the potential sale of its 40 billion euro ($48 billion) German life insurance portfolio to private equity-backed Viridium, a person close to the matter said.
Generali and Viridium declined to comment, and people familiar with the matter said no final decisions had been taken and that talks could still fall apart.
Italy's biggest insurer is expected to sell its German Generali Leben unit, which is in a ""run-off"" process honoring existing policies but not issuing new ones, for about 900 million to 1 billion euros, people close to the matter have said.
Generali Leben was put up for sale last year and Viridium has been vying with Fosun-backed peer Frankfurter Leben and Apollo-backed Athora (N:ATH) for the asset, sources have said. 
The sale process was delayed by German financial watchdog Bafin's concerns that policyholders be treated fairly, people close to the matter said.
Bafin had no immediate comment on Thursday.
Insurers are struggling to pay guaranteed returns because of record-low interest rates and European capital rules that have become more stringent for some life policies, prompting some companies to consider selling their life insurance portfolios.
Viridium is 80 percent owned by buyout group Cinven with reinsurer Hannover Re (DE:HNRGn) holding the rest. It has 15 billion euros in assets under management after the acquisitions of three smaller so-called ""back book"" portfolios from Heidelberger Leben, Skandia and Entis.
After fending off a possible takeover from Italy's biggest retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) last year, Generali has exited smaller markets such as Belgium to focus on core markets such as Germany.
Europe's No. 3 insurer, present in more than 60 countries, is looking to sell businesses in about a dozen countries.
Generali Leben would be by far the biggest sale of a run-off operation in Germany. Ergo, owned by Munich Re (DE:MUVGn), had considered a sale of an even bigger portfolio, but opted to wind down the unit itself after it deemed offers too low.
In Britain,  Prudential  (LON:PRU) earlier this year announced the sale of a 12 billion-pound UK annuities book to Rothesay Life.
The option of selling its German life portfolio is part of a broader reorganization of Generali's operations in the country, which has also seen German financial adviser DVAG, 40 percent owned by Generali, distribute its products exclusively.
Generali is aiming to keep a small minority stake in Generali Leben and to sign a partnership agreement with the buyer, a person familiar with the matter said.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Paulson's top real estate executives start own firm,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor John Paulson's top real estate executives are launching their own investment firm with $1 billion and the hedge fund manager's blessing, sources familiar with the matter said.
Michael Barr, a portfolio manager who headed real estate investing at Paulson & Co, and Jonathan Shumaker, a Paulson partner, will be spinning out the firm's two existing real estate funds into an independent private equity firm.
Cross Lake, based just a few blocks north of Paulson's Midtown Manhattan offices, will continue to oversee Paulson's Real Estate Recovery Fund, LP, launched in 2010, and Paulson Real Estate Fund II, LP, launched in 2013. The two funds have roughly $1 billion in assets. The entire real estate team at Paulson will be moving to Cross Lake, the sources said.
There are benefits to splitting for both sides, say industry analysts noting that the move comes at a time research firm Preqin has said that prices for real assets and competition among bidders are likely to rise in the years ahead.
Paulson, who earned billions for himself and his firm by betting against the overheated housing market during the financial crisis, is expected to keep his personal money in the real estate funds and keep investing with the team in the future, one of the sources said.
By letting Barr and Shumaker move on, Paulson is shrinking costs by eliminating their salaries and expenses of running and marketing the portfolios. For Cross Lake, the team is leaving the tarnished Paulson brand to make a name for themselves independently.
Since joining Paulson a decade ago, Barr, 47, and Shumaker, 40, have worked together on making investments primarily in residential land, offices and hotels throughout the southeastern, southwestern and western United States. 
Now they join the long line of senior executives and portfolio managers who have left Paulson & Co over the last years as the hedge fund's assets have dwindled from a peak of $38 billion in 2011 to roughly $8.7 billion in January.
Even as some of Paulson's prominent funds had off years, performance at the real estate funds has been a bright spot for the firm, returning over 20 percent on average per year, based on the current value of the investments and completed sales.
The real estate funds often bought land from developers that came with appropriate permits and some infrastructure like roads and sewers. Among the funds' deals was an investment in Newport Beach-based William Lyon Homes, which sold shares to the public in 2013 as the housing market recovered.
As Paulson's assets have shrunk, Paulson earlier this year laid off at least four senior executives as he focuses the firm on its core expertise, including mergers.
This year, Paulson's biggest funds are in the black with the Paulson European Opportunities Master Fund up 9 percent since January while the Paulson Pure Spread Fund is up 6.5 percent, a person familiar with the numbers said.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 06:57AM ET</span>",Macquarie launches green infrastructure bank GIG in North America,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macquarie Capital is launching the Green Investment Group (GIG) in North America, it said on Thursday, seeking to capitalize on the region's growing renewable energy industry and heightened demand among professional investors for its assets.
GIG was originally the Green Investment Bank, created by the UK government in 2012 as the world's first bank dedicated to supporting green infrastructure schemes. It was sold to  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG) in 2017 for 2.3 billion pounds ($3.02 billion).
Having expanded into Europe and, most recently, Asia, GIG will now operate in the United States and Canada, aiming to finance the development of renewable energy schemes, as well as structuring numerous smaller projects into larger investments that can be sold to institutional investors.
""Fundamentally, it's about asset creation, bringing projects together and de-risking them to make them attractive for insurance companies, pension and investment funds to own,"" Chris Archer, head of green energy for the Americas at Macquarie Capital, told Reuters.
Renewable energy generation in the United States has been growing at a significant pace, accounting for over half of the country's annual added electric capacity in five of the six years between 2012 and 2017.
While President Donald Trump's administration has implemented policies regarded as unfavorable to the renewables sector, including ending tax credits and placing tariffs on imported solar panels, demand from states and companies for more clean energy and the falling cost of technology are expected to support growth.
Investment bankers and industry analysts have noted there is an unprecedented amount of private capital trying to invest in the U.S. renewables sector.
However, Mark Dooley, Macquarie Capital's global head of green energy, believed the bank's focus on developing projects from the start meant there were still plenty of schemes it could back.
""There's a lot of capital chasing fully executed, packaged and operating projects that are easy to invest in. We're in there when work needs to be done, whether it's finance, structuring or technical skills.""
As part of its North American expansion, GIG will partner with two former  First Solar Inc  (O:FSLR) developers, Brian Kunz and Nik Novograd, to create Candela Renewables, which will develop solar projects in the U.S.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China shuns U.S. request for talks on airline website dispute over Taiwan,"By Matthew Miller, Michael Martina and David Shepardson
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has rejected U.S. requests for talks over how U.S. airlines and their websites refer to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, according to sources, including a U.S. official, adding to tensions in a relationship already frayed by a major trade dispute.
China has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, begin referring to Taiwan as Chinese territory on their websites, along with Hong Kong and Macau, a move described by the White House in May as ""Orwellian nonsense"". 
Numerous non-U.S. carriers, such as Air Canada, Lufthansa and British Airways have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters checks.
But several U.S. companies, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, were among carriers that sought extensions to a May 25 deadline to make the changes. The final deadline is July 25. 
In late May, the U.S. State Department presented China's Foreign Ministry with a diplomatic note requesting consultations on the matter, but the ministry has since refused it, two sources briefed on the situation told Reuters.
""This has definitely become a foreign policy issue,"" one of the sources said on condition of anonymity, noting that the U.S. government did not view it as a technical matter for bilateral aviation cooperation. 
The spat had become ""another grain of sand in the wound"" amid escalating trade tensions, a second source said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for intellectual property abuses. 
An official with the State Department confirmed to Reuters that China had rejected its request for talks on June 25, adding that it was ""disappointed"" and had maintained close communication with the airlines but had not told them how to respond to Beijing's demands.
""U.S. airlines should not be forced to comply with this order,"" the State Department official said. ""We have called on China to stop threatening and coercing American companies and citizens."" 
Chinese companies are free to operate their websites without political interference in the United States, the official added.
China's rebuff has left the U.S. government weighing its next move. The White House convened a staff-level meeting on the issue on Wednesday, but it is not clear what it plans to do.
""GOOD PLAN OF ACTION""
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously.
Armed by the United States, Taiwan has always been a major source of tension between Beijing and Washington, but it has been an increasingly contentious issue since Trump took office.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the rejection of discussing the issue with the United States, reiterated that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China and that this was the consensus of the international community.
Foreign companies in China must respect China's law and the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, he told a daily news briefing on Thursday.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrew H.C. Lee, said China's demands over the issue ""have reached new levels of hysteria"". 
""Taiwan is grateful to the efforts of like-minded countries that have chosen to take a stand against Chinese bullying of private enterprises,"" he said.
The companies have little incentive to defy Chinese regulations, but compliance could put them at odds with U.S. foreign policy.
Delta's chief executive, Ed Bastian, said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday that the airline was working with the U.S. government but would not say whether it would comply.
""We're working with the U.S. authorities on the topic and we'll stay close to our U.S. government,"" Bastian said, calling it a ""good plan of action"".
The chief executive of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, told Reuters in Washington on June 7 that the website issue was a ""government-to-government diplomatic issue and again we'll see what comes out of that and we'll react accordingly"".
Asked if he would defer to the White House, Munoz said that ""I fly to both places and I am deferential to our customers, and again this is not something I am going to solve"".
American Airlines said in early June that it had not made changes on its website, and that it was following the direction of the U.S. government.

It is unclear how China might seek to punish airlines that do not comply. But in December it changed rules governing foreign airlines operating in the country, including adding a clause that regulators could change a company's permit if it did not meet ""the demand of public interest"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mick Mulvaney, head of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut in half a fine that his Obama-era predecessor sought against a payday lender and dropped some of the agency's earlier claims in the case, three people familiar the matter told Reuters.
Mulvaney, appointed by President Donald Trump, has vowed to dial back what he says is overreach by the independent agency, which was created following the 2007-2009 financial crisis to stamp out predatory lending.
The CFPB fined South Carolina-based lender Security Finance $5 million on June 13 for harassing borrowers when collecting debt and mishandling credit report data. 
Richard Cordray, Mulvaney's predecessor, had wanted to seek additional charges against the company for pushing borrowers to buy personal insurance that was bundled into loans.
Cordray wanted Security Finance to pay $11 million, with $3 million as a penalty for the debt collection and credit reporting abuses and at least $8 million to compensate consumers who felt pushed into insurance, the sources said.
Mulvaney dropped the insurance claims, meaning the settlement with Security Finance leaves no money for customers Cordray wanted to remediate. Reuters reported in March that Mulvaney was reviewing the case.
""We are agreeing to this settlement to close the matter and move forward in serving our customers,"" said Security Finance chief Susan Bridges in a statement. The company declined to comment on its insurance business.
John Czwartacki, spokesman for the CFPB, said the agency's claims in the consent order were based on what was supported by evidence. 
""The enforcement arms of government should not be used in order to shake down the productive sector just because we can, especially when the legal case is shaky at best,"" he said. 
The CFPB has prevailed in many cases involving add-on products in the past and the industry will be watching to see if Mulvaney is pulling back from such cases, said Christopher Peterson, a former CFPB attorney. 
""The CFPB's job is to deter illegal activity, not look the other way,"" said Peterson, who now teaches at the University of Utah. ""If the agency eases up, industry will notice."" 
Mulvaney has also dropped several cases begun by Cordray, Reuters has reported. The Security Finance penalty was only the second in Mulvaney's seven months leading the bureau, following a record $1 billion fine against  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses.
Security Finance routinely charges triple-digit interest on short-term loans and sent collection agents to 1.3 million customers at home and at work, threatening and in some cases physically assaulting borrowers, according to the CFPB settlement.

Security Finance also delivered millions of faulty reports to credit bureaus, CFPB determined. In its settlement, Security Finance promised it would keep accurate records for the credit bureaus.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pressure on world shares from a U.S.-driven trade dispute mounted on Thursday, as a fast-charging dollar and a jump in oil prices also cranked up the pain in emerging markets.
Europe's bourses inched lower as traders positioned for a potentially fraught meeting of EU leaders (EU), with the mood set overnight by two-year lows for Chinese stocks and a six-month low for the yuan.
They, like Wall Street (N), had been buffeted again after U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow outlined plans to clamp down on Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies.
Asian shares had reached a nine-month trough, while MSCI's emerging market index - which also includes other hard-hit countries including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa - dropped to its weakest in almost a year.
MSCI's broadest gauge of the world's stock markets meanwhile fell to its lowest in almost three months and was on course to post its fourth losing month in the last five.
""If the trade war becomes bigger and bigger and bigger the impact will be very strong,"" said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner.
""You could see tech (stocks) taking a lot of impact... and you could see some big negative numbers on the main indexes,"" though he added he did not expect the situation to escalate to a full-blown crisis at this point.
There were other signs too that markets were getting nervous about the economic impact of the dispute.
U.S. Treasury and German Bund yields remained near one-month lows as bond investors sought out the guaranteed returns that stocks cannot offer.
The U.S. 2- to 10-year yield curve, whose flattening can be an early warning indicator of recessions, stayed pinned near the 11-year low of 31 basis points it had hit on Wednesday. A dip in Italian yields ahead of a key bond sale there did though point to some risk appetite returning.
Analysts cited local reports that tax cuts and a citizens' income would not be introduced next year as another factor boosting Italian government bonds.
""The general tone from the Italian government has been a little bit more conciliatory, which has given markets some comfort that the budget deficit should stay under control,"" said DZ Bank analyst Andy Cossor.
A European Union summit scheduled to begin later in the day could prove disruptive to markets, though, as embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks broader agreement on migration.
HOT OIL
Two main forces were playing out in the currency markets.
The trade tensions pushed the dollar - seen as one of the safest investments especially if U.S. interest rates keep rising - to test a one-year high against a basket of other top currencies. [FRX/]
Though the yen had shown some strength overnight, it remains firmly below a 2018 high of above 111 yen per dollar hit last month. The Swiss franc, another risk barometer, also remains firmly below 1.16 per euro, a level considered too strong for the central bank’s comfort.
In emerging markets, clear signs are emerging that traders think higher oil prices will lead to higher inflation in big oil importing economies, hurting their growth levels.
The Indian rupee hit an all-time low of 69.09 to the dollar during the Asian session, while Indonesia's rupiah slumped as much as 0.83 percent to touch its weakest since October 2015. [EMRG/FRX]
U.S. crude futures had surged 3.16 percent on Wednesday, rising to as much as $73.06 a barrel, the highest since November 2014, on signs of tight supply.
U.S. crude stocks fell nearly 10 million barrels last week while a fall in Canadian exports helped drain supplies of heavy crude across North America.
White House pressure on other countries to stop all imports of Iranian oil is seen as creating a shortage, while a power struggle in Libya has left it unclear whether its internationally recognized government or rebels will handle oil exports.
U.S. crude futures traded back a touch at $72.62 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent was 16 cents lower at $77.46.
""A number of people will be revising higher their assumptions for the loss of Iranian barrels,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told Reuters Global Oil Forum.

""If we assume that OPEC and its allies will deliver a near 1 million barrels per day (bpd) increase in production, most of it will be offset by lower volumes out of Iran.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Trade tensions and political concerns again weighed on European shares on Thursday as investors positioned for a potentially divisive European Union summit.
Having clawed back some ground on Wednesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) were down 0.4 and 0.6 percent by 0850 GMT, with technology and financial shares the biggest drags.
Tech stocks (SX8P) were the worst performers, falling 1.3 percent as concerns over tariffs spread to a sector thus far considered relatively resilient to trade disruptions. 
Chipmakers STMicro (MI:STM), Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and ASML (AS:ASML) were among the biggest laggards, while Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and  Micro Focus  (L:MCRO) also fell. 
Asian tech stocks had led a selloff overnight after threats from U.S. President Trump's threats to curb Chinese investment in U.S. tech firms.
High dividend-paying consumer staples stocks including Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), considered safer in times of market stress, made gains. 
A strong dollar was also a boost for the big dollar-earning multinationals.
H&M (ST:HMb) shares fell 3.4 percent at the open after posting earnings, but then recovered to trade up 1.5 percent. 
The world's second-biggest fashion retailer reported a slightly bigger fall than expected in second-quarter pretax profit and flagged higher markdown levels in the third quarter after inventories grew again.
""Gross margin comments, higher inventory and slower growth are disappointing,"" UBS analysts noted. 
But the shares recovered after CEO Karl-Johan Persson struck an optimistic tone about the second half. Large short positions in the stock mean it can snap back rapidly on any positive news.
The overall market mood was cautious ahead of the summit, at which differences over immigration and Brexit could be laid bare.
""Progress in deepening Euro area risk-sharing and risk reduction mechanisms to make the single currency framework more resilient continues, but the pace is slow,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists, adding they did not expect a significant breakthrough on euro area governance from the summit.
""While those initiatives remain incomplete, the euro area remains more vulnerable to economic slowdown and financial disruption than other jurisdictions.""
Investors have been pulling billions out of European equities in recent weeks and piling into U.S. stocks, as a slower pace of euro area economic growth and political risk in Italy persuaded them to seek opportunities elsewhere.
Lundbeck (CO:LUN) fell 4 percent after ABG Sundal Collier reduced the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"". 

Shares in satellite service provider SES (PA:SESFd) rose 3 percent, extending Wednesday's gains after hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital disclosed long positions in it and Intelsat.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Takeda shareholders bin proposal from anti-Shire group; only 10 percent in favor,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - A group of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502) shareholders, who are trying to build support to block the $62 billion acquisition of London-listed  Shire  Plc (L:SHP), failed to get a proposal passed at the drugmaker's annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday.
The proposal - to require advance shareholder approval for large acquisitions - received about 10 percent of votes in favor, the company confirmed to Reuters, casting doubt on the group's ability to gather enough support to scupper the Shire deal.
The Shire deal would turn Takeda into one of the world's largest drugmakers but the group says it would require taking on too much financial risk.
The 130 member-group formed by ex-Takeda employees told Reuters earlier this month it did not expect its proposal to pass on Thursday.
It said it is working to persuade a third of shareholders to vote against a company proposal at a Takeda shareholder meeting later this year or early next year to approve an issue of new stock to help fund the Shire deal, making it a de facto vote on the deal itself.
Thursday's proposal reflected concerns among some investors about the attempt by Chief Executive Christophe Weber - the company's first foreign head - to clinch the largest-ever overseas purchase by a Japanese company.
The move would turn Takeda into one of the world's most indebted drugmakers, though Weber has insisted he can deliver savings to make the deal a big winner for shareholders.
Shares in Takeda and Shire both gained more than 2 percent following the AGM.
Takeda's shares are nevertheless down 18 percent at 4,524 yen since the company first said at the end of March it was considering bidding for Shire.
With uncertainty over whether the acquisition will be approved by shareholders and given concern over the size of the deal, ""investors are taking a wait-and-see stance"" toward Takeda stock, UBS analyst Atsushi Seki wrote in a note to clients last week.
In the note, UBS upgraded its recommendation on Takeda stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and raised its price target to 6,700 yen. It also said a survey of 60 Japanese investors found 31 percent viewed the Shire deal negatively.

Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended voting against Thursday's proposal, saying that while its ""proponents raise legitimate concerns about the planned acquisition of Shire"" there was an ""absence of apparent grounds to cast doubt over the board's objectivity or competence"".

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",Australia's corporate watchdog vows to go after unscrupulous advisers,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate watchdog said on Thursday it will pursue enforcement action against financial planners who advise self-funded pension funds but have broken the law, saying a study found 90 percent of such planners were guilty of it.
A day after suing a unit of No. 1 wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) over alleged unlawful behavior by its representatives, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) warned it would pursue many others across the industry.
""Around 90 percent of financial advice on setting up a self-managed super fund (SMSF) did not comply with relevant laws,"" ASIC said in a statement on Thursday.
There are about 25,000 financial advisers servicing Australia's A$4.3 trillion ($3.15 trillion) retirement savings pool. Those advising self-managed retirement funds capture a fifth of their revenues, totaling about A$900 million, according to government figures.
The regulator said a study of hundreds of cases had found the unlawful advice ranged from poor record keeping to actions likely to result in significant customer losses.
One out of ten clients was likely to be significantly worse off because of the advice, while a fifth were at high risk of losses because of a lack of diversification in investments.
ASIC warned it would share intelligence with the Australian Taxation Office to target unscrupulous behavior.
""It is clear lots of people are setting up self-managed super funds without knowing whether this is the best option,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Peter Kell said in the statement.
ASIC, which has been criticized for not using its full punitive powers to tackle misconduct by financial advisers and their employers, will take enforcement action and ensure advisers and their employers compensate clients for losses, the regulator said.
A bruising inquiry into finance sector misconduct has revealed AMP, the company with the largest financial planner network, charged thousands of customers for financial advice it never gave. Under questioning, National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) admitted to similar behavior affecting hundreds of thousands of clients.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean trade group on Thursday asked the United States for exemption from a tariff on automobile imports for the Asian country, citing a security alliance and a bilateral trade deal. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on auto imports and foreign-made car parts after the Commerce Department finishes an investigation into the national security risks of those products. 
A coalition representing major foreign automakers including  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said on Wednesday the tariffs would harm automakers and U.S. consumers. Trump's administration launched a probe in May into whether the imports pose a security threat and he has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs. 
""We are confident that Korea is not a source of threats that may impair U.S. national security, but rather a market of great export potential that meets the interests of the American auto industry,"" Korea International Trade Association (KITA) said in comments it filed with the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
KITA counts Hyundai, Kia Motors (KS:000270) and other makers of cars and auto parts as member companies. 
KITA noted that South Korea and the United States in March had already agreed in principle to revise their bilateral trade deal, with Seoul saying it would improve local market access for U.S. automobiles and accept an extension on import tariffs for Korean pickup trucks for another 20 years. 
""Unlike other automobile exporting countries or other foreign manufactures, Korea and Korean automakers have already addressed the concern of the U.S. counterparts,"" it said. 
KITA said the trade deal revision works to ""ensure and maintain U.S. security interest in the region"". 
South Korea, home to production facilities for Hyundai Motor and U.S. automaker General Motors (N:GM), is the fourth-biggest auto exporter to the United States after Mexico, Canada and Japan. Hyundai and Kia also have factories in the United States. 

About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War that ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Panasonic flags battery cell shortages as Tesla Model 3 output picks up,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A pickup in production of Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model 3 cars, after earlier delays, has resulted in occasional battery cell shortages, a Panasonic Corp (T:6752) official said on Thursday in a sign Tesla is in overdrive to meet its end-June forecast.
Silicon Valley tech billionaire and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk earlier this month said his company should achieve its 5,000 cars-per-week target by the end of June, provoking scepticism from some Wall Street analysts. 
Yoshio Ito, head of Panasonic's automotive business, told the company's general shareholders meeting on Thursday there had been a ""sharp improvement in production"" that was leading to occasional battery (cell) shortages.
Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla's current production models, producing them in Japan as well as at Tesla's so-called Gigafactory in the U.S. state of Nevada, which Panasonic jointly operates.
It also has a joint plant with Tesla to produce solar cells and modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York.
But tying its fortunes to Tesla's, which has struggled with production bottlenecks, has sometimes looked like a risky bet.
A fatal crash in California earlier this year involving a Tesla car and another one in Florida last year has drawn regulatory scrutiny and hurt shares.
Tesla said earlier this month that it was cutting several thousand jobs across the company as it seeks to reduce costs and become profitable, without endangering the critical production ramp-up for the sedan, a closely watched metric.
""I wouldn't say the delay (in Tesla's Model 3 production) had no impact on our business, but we are in close communications with Tesla and working to steadily improve production,"" Ito said.
Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to boost automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022 from 1.8 trillion yen ($16.3 billion)estimated for this financial year.
To reduce the risk of over-relying on Tesla, Panasonic has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) to jointly develop batteries for electric vehicles.
At the shareholders meeting, Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said all solid-state batteries, next-generation batteries considered more stable, are unlikely to hit the automotive market anytime soon, even though the company was engaged in their development.
""We believe we can continue to improve performance of today's lithium-ion batteries at least until around 2025,"" Tsuga said. The commercialization of all solid-state batteries would come after that progress, he said.
Toyota is aiming to commercialize all-solid-state batteries by the early 2020s.

Fears of a trade war also buffeted the yuan , with anxieties pulling it lower, with some analysts saying the currency has further room to fall. 
The benchmark CSI300 Index (CSI300) and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) both gave up weak midday gains, deepening the losses that pushed them into bear-market territory on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
The Shanghai index was down 0.9 percent for the day and 10 percent in June, on track for its worst month since January 2016, when it tumbled 22 percent. The blue-chip index fell 1.1 percent on Thursday. For both, it was a four-straight losing day.
""In the short term, investor sentiment remains very pessimistic,"" said Lu Jie, head of research China at asset manager Robeco.
""The market is in the process of searching for the bottom,"" he said, expecting the market to stabilize in the second half. 
The stumbling indexes once again highlighted the difficulties Chinese policymakers face in stabilizing markets amid a pivotal deleveraging campaign.
In the spot market, the yuan  opened at 6.6177 per dollar, and ended the onshore trading session at 6.6250 per dollar, the weakest official close in seven months. 
In each of the past six days, the yuan has slid, taking it to its lowest levels since December 2017. 
BIGGEST DROP SINCE 1994 
The yuan has dropped more than 3 percent against the U.S. dollar June, more than in any other month since 1994 when China unified the market exchange rate. 
Some analysts said the currency has farther to fall, given its continued strength against other emerging market currencies.
""I think there is no urgency for the PBOC to stop the yuan from weakening further, as the RMB index has still appreciated year to date"" said Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC in Singapore.
He said the People's Bank of China ""is in the market to keep volatility in check, but not to change the direction of movement.""
However, Xie added that excessive weakening could prompt the central bank to reintroduce its ""counter-cyclical factor"" in calculating the yuan's midpoint.
The bank introduced the factor last year in what it said was an attempt to better reflect supply and demand, and reduce possible market ""herd effects"". Traders said the mechanism helped reduce volatility.
Market volatility in China ""is being driven by a combination of factors – Sino-U.S. trade tensions, concerns over corporate bond defaults in China and uncertainties to the growth outlook,"" Tai Hui, J.P. Morgan Asset Management's chief market strategist for Asia-Pacific, said in a note.
""Worries over corporate bond defaults are arguably the most dominant factor at this point, since the prospects of higher USD interest rates and subsequent USD strength are raising concerns that companies who have been heavy USD debt issuers could face challenges to service their debt, repay or refinance."" 
Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most traded contract, were 0.15 percent higher on Thursday.
The cost of insuring exposure to Chinese debt rose on Thursday to the highest in more than a year.
China's five-year credit default swaps (CDS) rose to 73 basis points (bps), the highest since early June 2017, and up 7 bps from Wednesday's close, data from IHS Markit showed.
The CDS have climbed 19 bps in the last 10 days.

A government think-tank report that appeared briefly online said that China should be wary of any financial panic stemming from uncertainties, such as bond defaults, tight liquidity and trade frictions with the United States.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",China GMO crop panel meeting raises approval hopes: sources,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - An influential Chinese scientific advisory board on genetically modified crops met last week for the first time in a year, two sources said, in a sign that Beijing may be preparing to approve new biotech crops for import.
The meeting, which took place from June 20 to June 22, according to one of the sources, comes amid escalating trade tension with the United States, the world's top producer of GMO crops.
""The meeting happened last week,"" said a second source with a Chinese seed company, who closely follows Beijing's seed approval process.
Both people declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter and because meetings of the National Biosafety Committee, which guides Beijing on GMO safety, are confidential.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which has the final say on approvals, did not respond to a fax seeking confirmation of the meeting.
No details of what was discussed were disclosed, but the committee's meetings are keenly watched by seed companies because the panel typically reviews GMO crops for approval for import.
China does not permit the planting of genetically modified food crops, but does allow GMO imports, such as soybeans and corn, for use in its animal feed industry.
Products currently waiting for Beijing's approval include two soybean products and a canola marketed by DowDuPont, a canola and two alfalfa products sold by  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) and a  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) canola product.
Expanding U.S. seed companies' access to China has been a key issue for Washington in talks to end a prolonged trade dispute with its top trading partner.
But relations have deteriorated since those talks took place, which may influence approvals.
""We understand the results are subject to whether the U.S. implements its tariffs on July 6,"" said the first source.
The United States plans to levy 25 percent tariffs on more than 800 strategically important imports from China from July 6, the latest response by U.S. President Trump to complaints about Chinese industrial policies, lack of market access in China and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit.
The slow and unpredictable process of getting approvals for new GM crops has long been a major irritant in agricultural trade between China and the U.S.
Some products have been waiting for Beijing's approval for seven years. The delays have cut U.S. gross domestic product by about $7 billion over the past five years by reducing sales of crops and other goods, according to a recent report commissioned by the industry.
Beijing promised to speed up a review of pending applications during 100-day trade talks with the United States last year, but disappointed the industry by only approving four out of eight products in the following weeks.
No other products have since been approved for import.
""In light of everything that is going on, it's very hard to tell if it's a positive sign or any sign at all,"" said a biotech industry official in the United States, referring to the meeting.
""They could meet and it means nothing.""

HANOI (Reuters) - General Motors Co (HN:GM) has agreed to transfer its Vietnamese operation to domestic car manufacturer VinFast Trading and Production LLC, in a move the pair said will marry GM's automotive expertise with VinFast's local market insight.
VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's biggest private conglomerate,  Vingroup JSC  (HM:VIC), will be the exclusive distributor of GM's Chevrolet cars in Vietnam under a strategic partnership agreement, the pair said in a statement on Thursday.
GM will transfer full ownership of its Hanoi factory to VinFast for the Vietnamese automaker to produce small cars under a GM global license from 2019, they said, without disclosing a value for the deal.
""Our vision is to build an automobile manufacturing eco-system that will include assembly plants, local automotive suppliers and dealers, and a string of supporting industries,"" said VinFast Chief Executive Jim DeLuca.
""Our plan is to launch a portfolio of five VinFast vehicles in 2019 and this strategic partnership is integral to that,"" he said.
Vingroup, which has businesses in retail, real estate, healthcare, education and hospitality, among others, set up VinFast last year to expand into the automobile sector.
VinFast, which is building a $1.5 billion car factory in the northern province of Hai Phong, plans to launch a sedan and sport-utility vehicle in the third quarter of 2019, and a small car, electric car and electric bus by the end of 2019.
Vietnam's automobile sales grew 24 percent in 2016 but fell 10 percent last year to 272,750 units, showed data from the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Sales fell 6 percent in the first five months of this year, the data showed.
GM said on its website its sales of Chevrolet cars in Vietnam grew 8.5 percent last year to 10,576 units, its highest since launching in 2006 and giving the brand a 3.9 percent market share.
That compared with sales growth last year of 34.5 percent in Indonesia and 25.7 percent in Thailand.
""The GM-VinFast strategic partnership will best position the Chevrolet brand and dealer network for long-term growth in Vietnam by leveraging GM's global scale and expertise, married with VinFast's domestic strength and insight,"" said Barry Engle, executive vice president and president of GM International.
""We are very excited about the opportunity to play a key role in developing the automotive industry in Vietnam,"" Engle said.

The transfer, which includes GM's Hanoi plant, dealer network and employee base, is expected to be conducted by the end of 2018, the companies said in the statement.

1261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 03:20AM ET</span>",Rusal Says It’s Doing Everything Required to Lift Sanctions Threat,"(Bloomberg) -- United Co. Rusal is doing everything it can to avoid punitive U.S. restrictions due for full enforcement in October, according to the Russian aluminum giant’s acting Chief Executive Officer Evgeny Nikitin.
“Right now, we are taking all the actions that should be be required to achieve the right result for the company,” Nikitin, who replaced Alexandra Bouriko, said in an interview Thursday after the company’s annual meeting in Hong Kong. “We are operating in full compliance with the conditions of our license” from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, he said.
(MCX:Rusal) has endured months of turmoil since the U.S. announced sanctions in April aimed at its billionaire founder, Oleg Deripaska, who resigned as a non-executive director last month in a fresh bid to distance himself from the company. The curbs are poised to take full effect from Oct. 23 unless Deripaska relinquishes control.
“The company, of course, has had some difficulties,” said Nikitin, who was named as acting CEO amid a mass exodus from the board last month. “We are now in constant contact with U.S. authorities,” he said. “I can’t speak concretely about that, but our contact is comprehensive, and always continuous.”
The U.S. sanctions fueled unprecedented volatility in global aluminum prices by casting doubt on the future of a major player in the global supply chain. Rusal churns out about 6 percent of the world’s aluminum and operates mines, smelters or refineries in locations including Guinea, Ireland and Jamaica -- in addition to its main base in Russia. Aluminum is now 5 percent higher that when sanctions were announced.
Rusal’s woes are emblematic of the much more significant role that geopolitics are playing in commodities markets in the past year. The sanctions on the company are part of a U.S. package of measures targeting dozens of Russian tycoons to punish the country’s elite for actions including allegedly meddling in the U.S. elections and incursions into Ukraine. These issues are among the topics for discussion when President Donald Trump meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at a summit this summer.
Asked if he was hopeful that the summit could be helpful for resolving Rusal’s difficulties, Nikitin said: “We are businessmen not politicians, so we will leave the politics to the presidents.”"
1262,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 02:57AM ET</span>","UK accounts watchdog probes Deloitte's audit of SIG's 2015, 2016 statements","(Reuters) - UK's accounting watchdog said on Thursday it began an investigation into Deloitte LLP's audit of two annual financial statements of SIG Plc (L:SHI) and is focusing on the audit of cash and supplier rebates.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it was probing financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2015 and 2016 at the distributor of specialist building products in Europe.
SIG said in February it was undergoing a review of its historic accounts after a whistleblowing allegation of potential irregularities that led to the suspension of some staff for overstating profits over several years.
SIG said then its forensic review had revealed an overstatement for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016 and a further overstatement of up to 400,000 pounds before 2016. It added it was working with Deloitte to ensure correct accounting.
On Jan. 9, it first disclosed an overstatement of cash of about 20 million pounds at the end of December 2016 and about 27 million pounds as of the end of June 2017.
The FRC said on Thursday it delegated the investigation to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which is Deloitte's recognized supervisory body.

SIG, which supplies insulation and roofing products, has been trying to strengthen its balance sheet by selling assets and reviewing costs, as it battles to recover from weak trading in its UK insulation, interiors and offsite construction businesses.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>",Australia foreign interference bill not aimed at China: trade minister,"By Colin Packham and Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade minister said on Thursday new legislation designed to prevent interference by foreign governments is not aimed at China, comments seen as an attempt by Canberra to diffuse bilateral tensions.
Australia's relationship with its largest trading partner, China, has soured since Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull late last year cited Beijing's meddling as justification for the tough new laws.
As the row impacts two-way trade, which hit a record $170 billion ($125 billion) last year, Minister for Trade Steven Ciobo sought to minimize the impact of the bill expected to be approved by the Senate on Thursday.
""The foreign interference bill, which in time we hope will become legislation, is not about China. It's about Australia's national sovereignty,"" Ciobo said at an event at the country's Parliament in Canberra.
""I think those who have attempted to portray it as being about the bilateral relationship with China have done Australia a great injustice,"" he said.
Mirroring similar rules in the United States, the Australian measures will require lobbyists for foreign countries to register, and makes them liable for criminal prosecution if they are deemed to be interfering in domestic affairs.
China denies allegations of meddling in Australian affairs, and has accused Canberra of harboring a ""Cold War mentality"".
Ciobo's comments could help to stem further damage to the relationship between the two countries, an analyst said.
""It is a step in the right direction for creating some space to rebuild the relationship,"" said Merriden Varrall, Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.
The widening diplomatic rift between Australia and China has affected Australian wine exports, including products from Treasury Wine Estates (AX:TWE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which have faced delays getting through Chinese customs.
Despite Australian efforts to ease the curbs, wine is only trickling into the industry's most lucrative market, expected to be worth more than A$1 billion ($735 million) this year.
Australian cattle graziers and citrus growers also fear they are being sidelined by China as a result of the row.

Overnight, the S&P 500 erased gains that reached 0.9% to finish at the worst level since May 29, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.3% amid renewed concern that the Trump administration will crack down on Chinese investment.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component opened 0.2% and 0.4% lower by 9:40PM ET (01:40 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2%.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday that the president is not retreating on China, although Trump’s plan to crack down on foreign investment is less harsh than many had expected.
The White House announced that it would not be looking to impose the new 25% new limits on Chinese ownership in U.S. tech-related companies, as reports had suggested earlier in the week. Instead, the government would rely on the newly strengthened Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to deal with concerns.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said all of President Trump's advisors were unanimous on the newly unveiled Chinese investment restrictions, which was announced Wednesday morning.
“We are going to treat China the way we are going to treat other people,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters. “And to the extent that we were worried about transactions, we will block them. But we are not going to on a wholesale basis discriminate against China as part of a negotiation.""
“It’s clearly been acting as a negative on the stock market,” Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday. “On days or times during the day like earlier today where trade issues appear to be receding, stocks tend to head higher, and I think ex the trade issues that’s where we’d be going.”
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.4% in morning trade. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.2%."

(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) said on Wednesday the chain will shut up to 65 underperforming restaurants and revamp its marketing under Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol, but many questions remain unanswered about what to expect under the new leadership.
Chipotle's share price has risen more than 80 percent since Niccol's hiring was announced in February and as the company focused on how to increase online sales. 
Chipotle will add ""in-app"" delivery of its products to about 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year and launch a long-awaited loyalty program in 2019, executives said on a call with investors on Wednesday.
Executives did not say whether fast-casual dining menu items such as quesadillas and nachos would be added to the menu, and they brushed aside a question about international plans, saying they would focus on ""aggressive growth"" in the United States. 
Shares fell 3.1 percent to $443 in after-hours trade after few details were delivered on how the beleaguered burrito maker would innovate its business model and improve its digital service.
""There are some key areas they really did not address, notably international strategy,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said. 
""Also capital allocation, particularly in regard to share buybacks and potential discussion for a dividend. I still think it will happen but it is probably going to be about a year or two away,"" Anderson said. 
Executives said costs from corporate restructuring would cause the chain to take between $115 million to $135 million in charges, including about $50 million to $60 million in the second quarter. The chain will close 55 to 65 restaurants.
Chipotle also said it would launch a customer loyalty program in 2019 and is exploring offering $2 tacos with a drink as part of a proposed ""happy hour."" The announced changes come as the troubled burrito chain seeks to recover after a rash of food safety lapses dragged on the brand.
After outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus were linked to its restaurants in 2015, the company's share price plummeted as diners retreated and rival chains grew their numbers through wider offerings and clever promotions.
While Chipotle made its name as a pioneer of ""real"" ingredients, critics of the fast-casual chain have complained that its menu offerings have grown stale. 
Niccol, the former chief of Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) Taco Bell who spearheaded the popular ""Doritos Locos Tacos"" and $1 Nacho Fries prior to joining Chipotle in March, is on track to bring some new flair to the chain's menu. Earlier this month, the company announced it is testing five new items, including quesadillas and nachos, at its test kitchen in New York. 
Analysts and investors expect Niccol to steer the company in a more modern direction, including through technology improvements, menu expansion and potentially opening the brand up to franchising.

Analysts on average expect Chipotle's retail sales to grow 8.4 percent in 2018, following 15 percent growth in 2017 and a 13 percent drop in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Reuters) - Tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods imposed by the Trump administration could hit up to 15 percent of goods moving through the Port of Los Angeles once they go into effect, the port's executive director Gene Seroka told Reuters on Wednesday.
Seroka said in a telephone interview that according to his data, imports from China coming through U.S. ports have slowed over the last two months and are down 3.8 percent in April and 8.7 percent in May.
Seroka said it was difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of declining imports, ""but there's something there... and it's something to be mindful of as we evaluate the potential impact of tariffs."" 
Los Angeles was Americas No. 1 container port in 2017, and according to government data it handled cargo valued at $284 billion, with about $145 billion of the total coming direct trade with China. Seroka said that in California one million jobs are tied to the port, with around 2.7 million employed at ports nationally. 
Seroka said he has heard from a number of cargo ship owners ""that they are contemplating pulling orders forward in order to avoid being hit with tariffs.""
Mid-year is typically the start of the Port of Los Angeles' peak season ahead of major U.S. retail events including ""Back to School"" sales promotions and holiday marketing in December.
Amid uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy, shipping rates on the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) to the U.S. West Coast have dropped nearly 20 percent since May. 
""That decline is troubling for us as we look toward our traditional peak season,"" Seroka said. ""You wouldn't normally see that fluctuation in price at this time, especially on the downward side.""
Last week the world's second largest container shipping company, MSC (Mediterranean Shipping Company), said that from July 4 it would suspend one of the Pacific Ocean services it runs jointly with Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), the world's largest shipper, citing a ""challenging operating environment for business on the Transpacific trade.""
That service does not call at Los Angeles, but Seroka said the move ""tells me there's uncertainty in the market and a certain softness that they (MSC) didn't like looking down the line.""

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>","After bankruptcy, Gibson plots return to basics, and possibly ukuleles","By Stephen Nellis and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - As Gibson Brands Inc targets an exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy later this year, the iconic guitar maker plans a return to traditional guitars after an ill-fated attempt at computerizing them and possibly a foray into ukuleles, CEO Henry Juszkiewicz told Reuters on Wednesday.
Nashville-based Gibson, the maker of guitars played by the likes of B.B. King and Slash, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May with roughly $500 million in debt and a plan to reorganize its musical instrument business under the new ownership of its lenders.
In an interview with Reuters as Gibson was preparing to show new products at the National Association of Music Merchants trade show in Nashville, Juszkiewicz said he was examining ways Gibson could expand its appeal beyond its pricey guitar models, which include the Les Paul and SG, to entice younger players and female players.
Many of Gibson's electric guitars sell for over $2,000.
Juszkiewicz is also considering capitalizing on an industry-wide boom in sales of ukuleles, the small-bodied Hawaiian instrument. While the company sells some so-called ukes under its lower-priced Epiphone brand, Gibson has not made one under its flagship brand since the 1930s, and Juszkiewicz said Gibson would ""absolutely"" consider a return to that business.
""One of the most valuable ukes you can buy today is a Gibson uke made in the '30s. We've been there,"" he said. But Juszkiewicz declined to disclose specific plans, saying the effort remains ""a work in progress.""
But with Gibson's core guitars, Juszkiewicz said the company plans on ""getting back to the basics."" That is a reversal from its 2015 decision to fit guitars with computerized tuning machines, a move that did not go over well with some guitar players.
Juszkiewicz is returning his focus to the core guitar business - which grew 10.5 percent to $122 million in the 12 months ended in January - after seeing most of his time consumed by the fallout from the unsuccessful acquisition of a Hong Kong-based consumer electronics arm of Philips in 2014. 
As part of Gibson's restructuring, Juszkiewicz, who along with partners acquired the then-ailing guitar company in the late 1980s, has a two-year consulting agreement with the company's lenders and soon-to-be owners, which include KKR Credit Advisors.
He said he did not know whether KKR had plans to name a successor as Gibson's chairman and CEO.
""I'm sure the gears are moving,"" he said.

KKR did not immediately return a request for comment.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX) on Wednesday avoided fines in a deal with eight states' banking regulators over a data breach that compromised sensitive data of more than 145 million people, as the credit reporting agency agreed to tighten up security.
Equifax's disclosure of the cyber attack in September 2017, one of the largest to date, prompted the ouster of top executives. Former Chief Executive Richard Smith in October told U.S. lawmakers that hackers got into its network by exploiting a known software vulnerability that the company had failed to patch.
Equifax must perform a detailed assessment of cyber threats, boost board oversight of cyber security and improve processes for patching known security vulnerabilities, according to the terms of the agreement. The consent decree was approved by regulators in Alabama, California, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina and Texas.
Equifax, which collects information on over 800 million individuals and more than 88 million businesses worldwide, said in a statement it had already completed ""a good number"" of the required actions.
""The findings, with a very few exceptions, are not new findings and are already part of our remediation plans,"" the statement said. ""We expect to meet or exceed all the commitments made under the Consent Order.""
The state regulators acted because federal agencies have so far failed to sanction Equifax for the breach, Maria T. Vullo, head of the New York Department of Financial Services, said in a statement.
""In an era of weakened federal government oversight, strong state regulation is essential,"" she said.
One consumer advocate said the lack of a financial penalty set a bad precedent.

""Companies don't change their practices unless they suffer financial consequences,"" said Jamie Court, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""The fact that Equifax is not required to pay any fines is sending the wrong message.""

Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the matter. The German bank did not admit nor deny the charges. 

FINRA, the U.S. securities industry's self-regulator, said that between June 2006 and April 2017 the bank's ""systemic deficiencies"" and lack of supervisory procedures led to billions of Order Audit Trail System violations.

RIO DE JANEIRO/DUBAI (Reuters) -  Anglo American  (L:AAL) has suspended a contract to supply Bahrain Steel with iron ore, the Gulf-based company said, in the latest headache for the miner's troubled Brazilian project after spills from a pipeline that carries the commodity to port.
The contract is worth nearly $1 billion annually, according to Reuters calculations using average realized prices reported by Anglo for its Minas Rio mine last year. 
Bahrain Steel, which produces iron ore pellets for steelmakers, said the London-based miner declared force majeure in April on the contract, which locks in a 20-year supply of 13 million tonnes of iron ore annually.
Anglo froze operations at Minas Rio in Minas Gerias state in March after two leaks were discovered in a pipeline that carries iron ore in slurry to an export terminal in coastal Rio de Janeiro. 
The suspension of the Bahrain contract underscores the severity of Anglo's problems with the project, purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion.
Bahrain Steel, which is owned by Foulath, a steel-focused investment vehicle in the Middle East, ruled out any serious impact on its own operations. 
""We have secured and effectively diversified our sources of raw materials ensuring continuity in our production and our ability to meet the needs of our customers,"" Bahrain Steel said in a statement to Reuters disclosing the April 4 force majeure notification. It did not say how much the contract is worth.
Anglo declined to comment. 
Shortly after the leaks, the miner said it would halt operations for three months, and projected a 3 million tonne hit to output forecasts for the year. Brazilian regulators imposed fines of 200 million reais ($51.81 million). 
But in late April, the company said the mine would be closed until the fourth quarter and projected 2018 output of just 3 million tonnes - all produced before the spills. Output for 2017 was 16.8 million tonnes.
It forecast annual group earnings would be dented by $300 million to $400 million due to the closure. 
Anglo also declared force majeure on a contract with Ferroport, a joint venture it has with port operator Prumo Logistica SA, following the spills. 
The contract is worth nearly $16 million a month, according to a Prumo filing to Brazilian securities regulator CVM in 2014, the first year the mine started shipments. Ferroport and Prumo are analyzing whether ""the events described (by Anglo) constitute Force Majeure,"" Prumo said in an April filing.
Anglo said in March that preliminary studies suggested the leaks were caused by cracks in the pipe welding from the manufacturing process.
The benchmark price of iron ore pellets <.IO65BP-CNO=MB> soared to almost $115 last week, up 30 percent from a year ago. 
Chinese steel mills, the world's biggest iron ore buyers, are increasingly using more pellets that can be fed directly to blast furnaces to curb emissions in line with Beijing's tighter environmental rules.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Reporter Without Borders: Life lessons with Vladimir Duthiers,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - TV news viewers may recognize one reporter who pops up in trouble spots all over the world: From the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, to the Boko Haram kidnappings in Nigeria, to assorted crises in Mali, Thailand, Algeria and the Mideast.
In an era when news reports largely rely on file photos and videos, CBS correspondent Vladimir Duthiers reports stories the old-fashioned way - on location. Risking your life like that tends to quickly put everything in perspective. 
Reuters spoke with Duthiers, 48, for the latest in our ""Life Lessons"" series, about his winding career path that has landed him at multiple crossroads of history.
Q: When your parents came to America from Haiti what outlook on life did they share with you?
A: Like many immigrants, their attitude was study hard and work hard, and anything is possible. It doesn't matter where you come from or what you look like, as long as you are willing to do whatever it takes to take it to the next level. As a result, they were pretty strict with me. I wasn't even allowed to wear sneakers to school.
Q: Did the fact they came from a poor country shape their perception of money and success?
A: They came to the U.S. in 1962, and back then Haiti was very different. It was like Havana in its heyday: Paved roads everywhere, policemen in uniforms, soccer matches on beautiful pitches, amazing hotels. For older Haitians, it's hard to reconcile the country they remember with the Haiti they see now.
Q: You are a familiar TV face now. You didn't start out in journalism. What made you switch? 
A: I started working on Wall Street, actually – first for Lehman Brothers, then for the firm that is now Alliance Bernstein. I wasn't fulfilling the promise I made to myself, that I wanted to be like Mike Wallace or Ed Bradley or Ted Koppel.
Q: Were you OK with earning a lot less money?
A: No, I was not! Most managers I interviewed with said, 'You are 38, you are working for one of the largest investment firms in the world, and you clearly have no idea what you are getting into.' They thought I wasn't serious about it. So I had to intern for free. I had some money saved, but I also had tuition and a mortgage payment and student loans, so I didn't emerge from the financial abyss until a couple of years ago.
Q: The 2010 earthquake in Haiti launched your career. What did you take away from that experience?
A: After the earthquake happened, I was at CNN, and Anderson Cooper asked if I wanted to be part of the team covering it. I said yes, and they said, 'Be at the airport in an hour.' But at first I had no idea how bad it was. We ended up being there for 40 days straight, in incredibly difficult and horrific conditions. There were huge mass graves, filled to the brim with people – men, women, children. I'll never forget what I saw. I just thought, 'There but for the grace of God go I.'
In many cases I would start to cry, and Anderson would tell me that it was OK. It's important not to lose your humanity.
Q: Having seen so much tragedy around the world, where do you devote your philanthropic dollars?
A: It's hard for me to pick, because there are always problems everywhere. But the International Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders are two organizations that do quality work, and don't focus on any specific country.
Q: What life lessons would you pass along to others?
A: A lot of kids these days see journalism as just a way to get on TV. But every single day, someone, somewhere is risking their life to do this job, because it's so important to democracy and civilization. So you may be in a situation where your life is at risk – and if you are not prepared for that, then this is not the profession for you. It is not a job to be taken lightly.

1282,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","From Goldman to Deutsche Bank, What to Watch for in Stress Tests","(Bloomberg) -- Can large U.S. banks hand $170 billion to their shareholders in the next 12 months? Will a top European investment bank botch the first public stress test of its entire U.S. business?
The Federal Reserve will answer those questions and more when it posts results from the second and final stage of its 2018 stress test Thursday at 4:30 p.m. While investors got hints during the first stage last week, the central bank has repeatedly found ways to surprise in past reviews of banks’ risk management and proposed cash payouts.
The results -- good or bad -- will land at a tense moment for bank stocks. The S&P 500 Financials Index fell a 13th straight day on Wednesday, the longest losing streak on record. Investors are concerned that recent interest-rate trends could crimp revenue from lending or that a trade war might derail global growth.
Here are the firms that analysts and investors are watching:
Goldman,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
In the first stage of the test, leverage ratios at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Morgan Stanley were projected to drop close to the minimum allowed in a stressed scenario, sounding alarm bells about their ability to increase payouts to shareholders. That test examined hypothetical losses with dividends continuing as before. The second phase looks at requests for future stock buybacks and higher dividends. Both firms quickly issued statements after last week’s result to warn against reading too much into it, arguing their capacity to distribute capital may be greater than what the numbers suggested.
Still, analysts have grown more skeptical the firms can increase their payouts -- or in Goldman’s case, that it can even maintain last year’s level.
“We don’t get to see all the details of how the Fed gets to its numbers, but it’s still hard to fathom how they can meet pre-test expectations,” said Brian Kleinhanzl at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “The math just doesn’t work.”
The pair may have to lower their proposed payouts to pass, Kleinhanzl said. Goldman already took that so-called mulligan twice since 2013, when the option was introduced. Morgan Stanley has used it once. Others saw the statements as lobbying the Fed for leniency, which could work in the bank-friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump.
“In the past that basically fell on deaf ears,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “The new guys might look at it a little differently.”
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
Analysts aren’t confident that Deutsche Bank AG’s U.S. operations can pass a key part of the test: the qualitative review of risk controls, internal oversight and other aspects of management. The bank’s U.S. unit already was placed on a Fed list of troubled lenders because its systems were deemed insufficient.
Like other big foreign banks operating in the U.S., the German firm was required to consolidate U.S. units under an umbrella holding company subject to the tests -- with results to be made public for the first time this year. But the company’s U.S. custodian unit took part in past tests, failing twice. The reasons then were similar to what landed the whole U.S. subsidiary on the Fed’s watch list.
“It’s pretty hard to expect a positive surprise for the state of Deutsche Bank’s controls,” said Markus Riesselmann, an analyst at Independent Research in Frankfurt. “Sadly, we’re all pretty much used to bad news around Deutsche Bank, so a negative result won’t necessarily hurt their share price.”
Banks can fail the qualitative exam even with strong capital. Deutsche Bank’s custodian unit had about 29 percent capital under stress both years it failed. The full U.S. subsidiary’s capital fell to 12 percent in last week’s projections, significantly higher than the minimum 4.5 percent. The business didn’t send any dividends home last year despite exceeding capital requirements. Failing this week would prevent it from doing so once again.
Other Foreign Banks
Other newbies this year include the U.S. units of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada and UBS Group AG. Even though they all handily passed the quantitative portion last week, they could be tripped up in the qualitative section as they adjust to the Fed’s expectations.
“The qualitative assessment will be the tricky test,” KBW’s European analysts wrote in a note June 22. “New entrants statistically find passing a challenge.”
Even the largest U.S. banks failed in the early years of the tests for qualitative reasons as they struggled to adapt. Such incidents petered out as the banks got the hang of the exercise. Last year, most were exempted from that portion as the threshold was raised.
The Rest
 State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). also came close last week to the minimum for its leverage ratio and might have to curtail plans for payouts, according to KBW’s Kleinhanzl. But the rest of the field -- 20 U.S. lenders and seven foreign banks with U.S. operations -- are all expected to get the green light. That means U.S.-based firms could boost payouts by $30 billion while arms of foreign banks send cash home.
Here’s a snapshot of the payouts analysts were estimating for some of the largest banks before last week’s results were announced:"

1289,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. GDP, Fed Speak, Jobless Claims on Tap
A slew of U.S. economic data is slated for Thursday including a crucial update on the pace of U.S. economic growth.
The final reading of first-quarter U.S. GDP at 08:30am ET is expected to show the economy expanded 2.2%, in-line with the previous reading seen last month. While the GDP price index is forecast to show an increase of 1.9% for the quarter.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance due 08:30 am ET for the week ended June 22, expected to show jobless claims rose to 220,000 from 218,000 the prior week.
At 9:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will speak and may offer insight into the Fed's thinking on monetary policy.
Traders will likely watch U.S. equities closely after an intraday reversal saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average give up more than 285 points to end the session in negative territory. US stocks had rallied intraday after the White House softened its stance on restricting foreign investment.
The dollar rose sharply Wednesday against its rivals supported by a slump in both GBP/USD and EUR/USD.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Oil Price Rally in Focus 
Natural gas prices climbed more than 1.81% on Wednesday – a day ahead of a report on inventories – amid expectations that a warmer U.S. summer could raise demand for air-conditioning, slashing natural gas supplies.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage rose by 71 billion cubic feet last week, adding to the build seen in the prior week.
In oil markets, meanwhile, the rally in crude oil prices will be closely watched as concerns over a possible global supply shortage continue to mount amid unexpected outages and the prospect of lower crude exports from Iran.
Crude futures settled at their highest price since November 2014 at $72.76 a barrel, up 3.2%.
3. Nike: Just Buy It?
Sportswear apparel giant  Nike  is slated to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday after the closing bell, and investors will be closely monitoring the sportswear giant's performance in its core U.S. market.
Analysts expect Nike to report earnings of 64 cents a share on revenue of $9.41 billion.
Nike's shares had rallied sharply in the run up to the earnings report but have since pared gains over the past two weeks. This comes despite expectations that the sportswear giant has managed to plug the leak in sales on its home turf.
In the most recent quarterly report, Nike reported that sales dropped 6% in North America, which makes up roughly 40% of total revenue.
In a bid to combat falling market share in North America, Nike has reined in merchandise and ramped up innovation, raising investor expectations that the sportswear giant could return to U.S. market growth sooner rather than later.
""Nike's multiple accelerates as sales momentum builds and gross margin rates are expanding, which in our view are key factors in the fiscal-year 2019,"" Wedbush said in a recent note.
Shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) closed at $71.37, down 1.64%."

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 03:07PM ET</span>",U.S. gives Disney approval to buy Fox amid bidding war with Comcast,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co won U.S. approval to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc entertainment assets for $71.3 billion on condition it sell Fox's 22 regional sports networks, the Justice Department said on Wednesday, giving Disney an edge over Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's competing bid.
The Fox movie franchises and TV shows have been the subject of a bidding war between Disney and Comcast, both of which want to expand their own entertainment businesses to compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The deal does not include the nationally broadcast Fox News, Fox Business or Fox Sports networks. 
If Disney prevails over Comcast, the combination would expand Disney's unrivaled portfolio of some of the world's most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox's X-Men, ""Avatar"" and ""The Simpsons"" franchises.
Disney owns ABC, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox's stake in Hulu. 
Disney, which also owns sports network ESPN, has agreed to divest all of Fox's regional sports networks, which provide sports programing for regional and local markets, such as Fox's YES Network, which airs New York Yankees baseball games around the New York metro area. 
Together, Fox's regional sports networks have about 61 million subscribers and have rights to broadcast live games of 44 of 91 U.S. professional sports teams in three of the four major sports leagues.
The Justice Department said that without the divestitures, ""the proposed acquisition would eliminate the substantial head-to-head competition that currently exists between Disney and Fox and would likely result in higher prices for cable sports programing.""
Disney's agreement with the government could be a setback for Comcast, which has yet to respond to Disney's latest offer for Fox, unveiled last week. Comcast, whose offer is worth $65 billion, declined to comment. 
Fox also declined to comment. 
Disney said it was ""pleased"" with the agreement reached with the Justice Department and said it looked forward to creating ""even more compelling consumer experiences.""
Analysts have antitrust concerns about Comcast's competing bid, which would add Fox's movie and TV studios to Comcast's NBC Universal. Chief Executive Brian Roberts had said that Comcast was willing to offer the same conditions as Disney and promised to fight for the deal in court if necessary.

The sports networks could attract a variety of bidders among technology and media companies looking to get their hands on live sports, sources said, although the industry-wide growth of these local sports networks has declined in the past few years as more viewers cut the cord on traditional cable packages.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Boeing's engine proposal deadline looms for new mid-market jet: report,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Three of the largest engine makers face a Wednesday deadline to provide  Boeing Co  (N:BA) with formal proposals for how they would power the planemaker's possible new mid-market jet, an aviation magazine reported.
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment but said the Chicago-based planemaker continues ""to make good progress"" in developing the jetliner's ""business case.""
Boeing's request for proposals would mark an important step toward bringing into service a jet with the potential to carve out new routes in 2025, though Boeing has stressed it would not be rushed into a decision on the plane.
CFM International - a joint venture between  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) - Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), and Rolls-Royce (L:RR) were submitting proposals, the Air Current reported, citing unnamed sources.
Boeing is studying plans for what industry sources describe as a hybrid jet combining a wide cabin and a restricted cargo space, moulded to fly efficiently in a space between the industry's single-aisle jets and wide-body long-haul aircraft.
Boeing aims to broadly replace its 757 model, a narrow-body jet with a single aisle. It envisions a mid-market jetliner with 220 to 270 seats and a range of up to 5,000 nautical miles, with global demand for 4,000 to 5,000 jets over 20 years, though rival Airbus (PA:AIR) disagrees with that forecast. 
Boeing wants an engine that burns 25 percent less fuel for every pound of thrust it produces compared with the 757's decades-old turbines, the Air Current reported. The timing for choosing either one or two manufacturers was not immediately clear, it said.
General Electric (N:GE) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rolls-Royce, which is facing problems with parts of the Trent 1000 engine that have led to the grounding of some 787s for repairs, said, ""whenever an aircraft manufacturer comes forward with a proposal we will have a technology response.""
A Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) representative referred to comments made earlier this month by its commercial engine business chief Chris Calio: ""I think the (Geared Turbofan engine) scales well, and so we're always looking and interested in other applications for the GTF as long as it makes sense for us.""

Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said in a research note that CFM ""is likely to be the keenest contender"", and might offer a derivative of its GE9X engine, which serves the forthcoming 777X. He said he would be surprised if Pratt and Rolls were not also in the mix.

1296,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",This Inverted Market Curve Is Already Causing Investors Pain,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s one market where an inverted curve is already causing pain for portfolio managers: foreign exchange.
Ben Emons, chief economist and head of credit portfolio management at Intellectus Partners, highlighted the inversion in some currency volatility curves as another channel through which angst over potential shifts to the global trading order are weighing on equities around the world.
The one-month implied volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the yuan now trades at a premium to that of the one-year contract, a shift that’s occurred amid the greenback’s 3 percent advance versus the Chinese currency over the past two weeks.
This doesn’t get nearly as much attention as yield curve inversions, but it’s still a clear negative for markets because it encourages portfolio managers to take less risk abroad, according to the strategist.
“The higher short-term FX volatility, the harder to currency hedge international bond and stock portfolios,” Emons wrote in a note Wednesday. “That leads to a ‘return to the base’ by reducing risk such as emerging market exposure and dialing down FX positions to the home currency.”
That is, as a trade war threatens to interrupt the flow of goods and services globally, it may already be impacting the global flow of capital.
Similarly, volatility curves for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso are inverted as the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement remains muddled heading into Mexico’s July 1 election."

(Reuters) - A mini rally in U.S. stocks, sparked by a U.S. move to ease its stance on curbing Chinese investments in American technologies, ran out of steam in afternoon trading on Wednesday, but a jump in oil prices helped prop markets.
President Donald Trump said he will use a strengthened national security review panel — the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — to deal with potential threats from Chinese acquisition of U.S. technology, instead of imposing China-specific restrictions. 
The decision marks a somewhat softer approach to curbing Chinese investments than reports on earlier plans to block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. tech firms.
""Nothing today came out other than commentary from the administration. The problems that we're dealing with in the market isn't going to be allayed by a couple of interviews,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
""We're going to need significant commentary from the President, trade advisers about where this is all going.""
After an initial rally, the S&P technology (SPLRCT) and industrial (SPLRCI) sectors — which have a relatively higher revenue exposure to China – fizzled. Tech stocks fell 0.63 percent, while industrials held a slim 0.15 percent gain.
The drop was relatively steeper in chipmakers, which on average get about a quarter of their revenue from China. The Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) slid 1.4 percent.
""I think it's still likely that chip stocks are a point of contention between the U.S. and China. So when they drop so low, they get interesting to investors and they come back to a place where fear kicks in again,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
At 13:39 ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 16.21 points, or 0.07 percent, at 24,266.90, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 5.62 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,717.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 54.88 points, or 0.73 percent, at 7,506.75.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) was up 1.6 percent, leading the gainers among the 11 major sectors, lifted by a jump in U.S. crude price as plunging stockpiles compounded supply concerns. [O/R]
Among stocks,  General Electric  (N:GE) gained about 3.2 percent, riding the optimism from the industrial conglomerates' restructuring plans announced on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc (N:CAG) said on Wednesday it would buy Pinnacle Foods Inc (N:PF) for about $8.1 billion, trying to grab a bigger share of the fast-growing snack and frozen food markets amid fierce competition in the packaged food industry.
The cash-and-stock deal, which would make Conagra the No. 2 U.S. frozen food maker by sales after Nestle (S:NESN), comes as demand rises for convenient, healthy ready meals, especially among millennials. 
Conagra and Pinnacle Foods have been investing aggressively to become the two fastest-growing frozen meal companies, according to analysts, with such brands as Birds Eye, Power Bowls and Hungry-Man, which tout more protein and fewer artificial ingredients.
The combined market capitalization of Conagra and Pinnacle Foods is about $23 billion, on par with rival Kellogg Co (N:K). The deal comes at a time when scale and negotiating power are crucial to packaged goods companies being squeezed by high commodities and freight costs and pressure from retailers for low pricing.
""M&A is a common theme we're going to continue to see as the growth environment has slowed for many packaged goods companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said, adding that many in the industry considered the deal ""inevitable."" 
""There are benefits to M&A on the cost side of things from buying power to supply chains, by being larger. But there's also benefits on the negotiating side with prices, merchandising and working with retailers,"" Weissman said.
Conagra Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly told Reuters the deal would help the company cut down on supply chain costs and strengthen its relationship with retailers.
""We can do a better job of filling full truckloads when we ship to our customers and work more efficiently,"" Connolly said, adding that the company will use the cash from cost savings to invest more in developing its brands.
DEAL WAS 'INEVITABLE'
Chicago-based Conagra said the two packaged food companies would have reported a combined $11 billion in full-year proforma net sales, with $4.9 billion in frozen food sales. It expects to save about $215 million by the end of the fiscal year 2022.
Pinnacle shareholders would get $43.11 per share in cash and 0.6494 Conagra shares for each Pinnacle share, implying an offer price of about $68 a share.
Including debt, the deal is valued at $10.9 billion. It is expected to close by the end of calendar 2018.
The acquisition is a victory of sorts for Connolly, who had unsuccessfully tried to buy Pinnacle when he was CEO of Hillshire. The sale to Hillshire was canceled after Hillshire agreed to sell itself to  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) for $7.7 billion.
Talks between Conagra and Pinnacle, however, restarted after activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC in April bought a 9.1 percent stake in New Jersey-based Pinnacle and urged the company to look for a sale. 
Conagra stock slid 7 percent to $35.56 and Pinnacle fell 4.2 percent to $65.
Weissman said Conagra shares were likely down because the market was not thrilled with Conagra using shares for the deal. Also on Wednesday, the company reported mixed quarterly results, with better-than-expected sales but lower earnings than analysts had expected.
Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said the implied offer price was below the $75 per share he expected.
He said the offer was ""a bit surprising,"" citing other recent deals, such as  General Mills  Inc's (N:GIS) purchase of Blue Buffalo, which have reached up to 19 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Centerview Partners are Conagra's financial advisers, while Evercore and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are advising Pinnacle.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 01:33PM ET</span>","Volvo, FedEx test truck 'platooning' on public U.S. road","By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Truck maker Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb) and package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said on Wednesday they have begun public U.S. testing of ""platooning"" technology, which allows digitally-connected semi trucks to save fuel by driving closely together in convoy, on a highway in North Carolina.
Using a state permit, Volvo and FedEx have been conducting tests on a section of North Carolina highway 540 since April, running three trucks towing two trailers each, a configuration FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) run in a number of U.S. states.
Keith Brandis, Volvo's North American vice president for product planning, said the tests will help the truck maker amass data to persuade other states and the federal government to permit more testing.
""Armed with hard facts and data, we hope to make our case,"" Brandis said. ""The business benefits of this technology will be proven in the coming months.""
A number of U.S. states have approved rules for trials of the new technology, but they vary by state. 
Volvo and FedEx said that while fuel savings from platooning vary, running trucks in convoys using this technology should boost safety.
Platooning uses a relatively low level of automation. The driver of the lead truck driver is in control, and the other trucks in the convoy follow automatically. For instance, if the driver of the lead truck hits the brakes, the other trucks brake automatically. 
A number of truck manufacturers and startups are experimenting with platooning and autonomous technologies, including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV) and electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). 
Truck makers including Volvo are already testing platooning technology on highways in Europe.
Daimler last September said it had received permission from the Oregon Department of Transportation to test its platooning technology on public roads after successful trials in its proving ground in Madras, Oregon.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Fresh optimism on trade lifts European shares,"By Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) - Relief that the trading dispute between China and the United States was on course to de-escalate pushed European shares higher on Wednesday after a start in negative territory. 
Fears over higher global barriers to trade had initially sent European stocks to 11-week lows but the Trump's administration decision to use an existing, but strengthened, security review for investments in technologies, rather than China specific restrictions, fueled optimism.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) closed 0.7 percent higher as Wall Street opened higher, also boosted by the news.
""Firmly strapped into the trade war rollercoaster, the markets saw a chunky upswing on Wednesday afternoon as Trump appeared to pull back from the brink"", said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst for Spreadex. 
Energy stocks (SXEP) added the most points to the index as crude prices climbed on supply disruption in Canada and after U.S. officials told importers to stop buying Iranian crude from November.
 BP  (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) rose 3.3 percent, 2 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. 
Industrials Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) which had been big drags on the index as investors priced in a more difficult trade environment for big exporters, rebounded with rises of 2.7 percent and 1.9 percent. 
Autos stocks (SXAP) also made a come-back in the black, up 0.2 percent and drove Germany's DAX up 0.9 percent. 
 Imerys  (PA:IMTP) shares rose 4 percent after analysts at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) upgraded the mineral extracting and processing company to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"". 
Shares in French oil storage and distribution company  Rubis  (PA:RUBF) fell 5.1 percent after Berenberg cut the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy, saying weakness in the oil storage business is likely to persist in the short- to medium-term.
Despite the change of mood on Wednesday, investors have overall been pulling billions out of European stocks and shifting into U.S. stocks in recent weeks as trade tensions ratcheted up. 
A global investor confidence index by State Street dropped in June, with the decline in sentiment largely driven by a significant fall in European investors' confidence. 
""Right now the environment is more positive for U.S. stocks but that could change fairly quickly,"" said Invesco's Hooper, adding: ""One of the key themes this year is rotation of leadership."" 

Analysts have been upgrading their earnings expectations for European stocks in the past weeks despite building trade tensions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund investor Doug Kass said on Wednesday that he is adding to his already large bank exposure in  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG's problems ""will benefit large U.S. money center banks.""
Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, said he believes Deutsche Bank, whose shares fell to a year low overnight, is weighing on the banking sector as some investors are concerned about Deutsche Bank's large derivative portfolio and its counterparty risk with U.S. money center banks. 
""I view the current underperformance in banks stocks as an important intermediate-term opportunity to acquire valuable long term investments,"" Kass said. ""Deutsche Bank's woes are actually a positive for U.S. money center banks that are rapidly gaining share in fixed-income trading and retail and corporate lending,"" he said. 
Kass characterizes Deutsche Bank as the ""next Black Swan for the EU economy"" as shares are down 40 percent year-to-date. ""Deutsche Bank is the Sears Holdings of the global bank industry,"" Kass said. Like Sears Holdings Co, Deutsche Bank has no current profits, is in a state of operating flux, is being forced to sell assets, has an extremely low equity capitalization and a large and leveraged balance sheet, Kass said. 
""Consider that Deutsche Bank's equity cap is only about $23 billion, compared to $170 billion for Citigroup - even though both have a comparable amount of assets on their balance sheet at $1.75 trillion,"" Kass notes. Deutsche Bank generates less than $50 billion in revenue compared with Citigroup's $65 billion. 
By contrast, JPMorgan has $2.5 trillion in assets, $200 billion of equity and generates almost $100 billion of revenue, Kass said. ""Reflecting operating losses and a toxic asset book of European loans and sovereign debt, Deutsche Bank trades at only one-third of overstated shareholders equity compared with Citigroup at 90 percent of shareholders equity and JPMorgan at 1.8 times capital,"" he said. 
But most disconcerting, Kass said, Deutsche Bank has an ""opaque derivatives book - probably at about $40 trillion with an estimated net exposure of approximately $100 billion."" 

""Deutsche Bank's financial and operating woes as well as those of other equally challenged EU banks and concentration on cost savings instead of business building have and will continue to inure to the benefit of the large U.S. money center banks who stampede towards gains in corporate and retail market share as well as taking share in global fixed-income trading,"" Kass said.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",General Mills to cut jobs amid rising costs,"(Reuters) - Cheerios cereal maker  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) said on Wednesday it would cut 625 jobs as it looks to reduce costs in the wake of slowing sales of its Yoplait yogurt, as well as rising commodity and freight expenses.
Shares of the company, which also reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, were up nearly 2 percent in midday trading.
General Mills, which also owns Häagen-Dazs and Betty Crocker brands, has been struggling to turn around its U.S. yogurt business as competitors such as Chobani and  Danone  (PA:DANO) unleash new flavors and healthier versions of yogurt. 
Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said he expects new launches, including yogurt with high protein and less sugar, to boost sales in 2019.
As the company's yogurt sales continue to fall, General Mills has relied on cereals and snack business to help prop up its top line. 
For 2019, the company expects total organic net sales to be in the range of flat to up 1 percent in 2019. Including the impact of it acquisition of pet food snacks maker Blue Buffalo, net sales are expected to rise 9 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier.
Net earnings attributable to the company fell 13.4 percent to $354.4 million.
Excluding certain items, General Mills earned 79 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Net sales rose 2 percent to $3.89 billion, in line with analysts estimate. 
Gross margins for the quarter rose to 36.5 percent from 34.7 percent a year earlier.

""We were pleased to see profit margins improve from a year ago as cost savings and increased sales of products with higher profit margins more than offset headwinds from higher transportation and input costs,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 35 largest U.S. banks are poised to put more money toward dividends, share buybacks and business investments, after clearing the first stage of an annual regulatory stress test on Thursday, showing they have enough capital to withstand an extreme recession.
Although the lenders would suffer $578 billion in total losses in the Federal Reserve's most severe scenario to date, their level of high-quality capital would be greater than the threshold that regulators demand - and above levels seen immediately leading up to the 2007-2009 crisis, the Fed said.
Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam, showing whether banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. Some might still stumble in next week's second, tougher test, which includes operational factors like risk management.
""This is the science and next week is the art,"" said Mike Alix, financial services risk leader at PwC. ""This is the mathematical calculation that shows there are robust levels of capital for most firms. Next week will be the judgment.""
The Fed introduced the stress tests during the financial crisis to ensure the strength of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy.
Since the first test in 2009, banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $800 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said.
U.S. subsidiaries of six foreign lenders, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and UBS Group AG, also go through the test and had their results publicly released for the first time.
Deutsche Bank, whose U.S. operations have been under intense regulatory scrutiny, also easily met all the minimum capital requirements, as did Credit Suisse and UBS, the results showed.
Other banks tested include household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, as well as major regional lenders like  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and U.S. Bancorp and Wall Street banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Banks investors view the test as a hurdle for capital returns through stock buybacks and dividends. It could also boost the case for regulatory relief promised by the Trump administration.
The Fed increases the difficulty of the test as the broader economic environment improves. This year the test features a severe global recession with the U.S. unemployment rate rising by almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent, accompanied by a steepening Treasury yield curve.
Some banks' results were hurt this time by the new federal tax law, which changed the impact of past losses on hypothetical tax bills under the scenarios, senior Fed officials said.
The second portion of the test will be released on Thursday. Those results will determine whether the Fed approves or denies capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed's.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","Automakers warn U.S. tariffs will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, hike prices","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major auto trade groups on Wednesday warned the Trump administration that imposing up to 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.
A coalition representing major foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), BMW AG, and Hyundai Motor Co, said the tariffs would harm automakers and U.S. consumers. The administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs.
""The greatest threat to the U.S. automotive industry at this time is the possibility the administration will impose duties on imports in connection with this investigation,"" wrote the Association of Global Automakers representing major foreign automakers. ""Such duties would raise prices for American consumers, limit their choices, and suppress sales and U.S. production of vehicles.""
The group added: ""Rather than creating jobs, these tariffs would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs producing and selling cars, SUVs, trucks and auto parts.""
On Friday Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports of EU-assembled cars. On Tuesday Trump said tariffs are coming soon. ""We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it wont take very long!"" Trump tweeted.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Toyota and others, urged the administration in separate comments filed Wednesday not to go forward.
""We believe the resulting impact of tariffs on imported vehicles and vehicle components will ultimately harm U.S. economic security and weaken our national security,"" the group wrote, calling the tariffs a ""mistake"" and adding imposing them ""could very well set a dangerous precedent that other nations could use to protect their local market from foreign competition.""
The Alliance said its analysis of 2017 auto sales data showed a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles would result in an average price increase of $5,800, which would boost costs to American consumers by nearly $45 billion annually.
Automakers are concerned tariffs will mean less capital to spend on self-driving cars and electric vehicles.
""We are already in the midst of an intense global race to lead on electrification and automation. The increased costs associated with the proposed tariffs may result in diminishing the U.S.' competitiveness in developing these advanced technologies,"" the Alliance wrote.
Both automotive trade groups cited a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that the cost to U.S. jobs from the import duties would be 195,000 jobs and could be as high as 624,000 jobs if other countries retaliate.
The proposed tariffs on national security grounds have been met by opposition among many Republicans in Congress.
Trump has made the tariffs a key part of his economic message and repeatedly lamented the U.S auto sector trade deficit, particularly with Germany and Japan. Some aides have suggested that the effort is a way to try to pressure Canada and Mexico into making more concessions in ongoing talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the department aimed to wrap up the probe by late July or August. The Commerce Department plans to hold two days of public comments in July on its investigation of auto imports.
The Commerce Department has asked if it should consider U.S. owned auto manufacturers differently than foreign automakers.
The Association of Global Automakers rejected that contention, saying its members' American workers ""are no less patriotic or willing to serve their country in a time of crisis than any other Americans.""
The group questioned national security as grounds to restrict auto imports. ""America does not go to war in a Ford Fiesta,"" they added.
The Alliance said ""there is no basis to claim that auto-related imports are a threat to national security"" and noted that 98 percent of U.S. auto imports came from U.S. national security allies.
In 1941, there were 31 manufacturing facilities in the U.S producing fewer than four million vehicles, the Alliance said. By contrast, the United States now has 45 assembly plants - operated by both U.S. and foreign automakers. Those plants produced nearly 12 million vehicles in 2017, more than three times the production volume before World War II.

""We are confident that today's U.S. production capabilities are more than sufficient to satisfy our country's future security needs,"" the Alliance wrote.

1335,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Elon Musk just revealed new details about Tesla's upcoming pickup truck,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed some new details about the company’s upcoming all-electric pickup truck in a series of tweets on Tuesday via Twitter.
Musk said the truck will come standard with dual motor all-wheel drive, ""crazy torque,"" and a suspension that dynamically adjusts for the load.
Musk also said that the vehicle would be able to parallel park automatically and would come with 360-degree cameras and sonar. 
He then teased another mysterious feature and said ""It will also have a special built-in sensor. Details later.""
While Musk has plans of his own for the truck, he said he is also open to suggestions when it comes to features for the vehicle. 
""What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck?"" Musk also asked his followers. ""I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances & what would be seriously next level?""
Musk has been talking about a pickup truck since at least 2013, but he said in December that the truck would arrive after the Model Y, so sometime after 2019.
Musk also said in December that the truck would be bigger than the F-150 and that it would have a 'gamechanging' feature, though he did not elaborate on what that feature might be. 
Pickup trucks are currently one of the hottest selling segments in the US, so it makes sense the company has plans to enter the space. But given the company's struggles to ramp up production of its newest vehicle, the Model 3, the timeline for the pickup truck could be pushed back past 2020.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boss of Italian bank Carige rejects criticism in boardroom feud,"MILAN (Reuters) - The chief executive of Italian lender Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) rejected accusations that he kept fellow directors in the dark on key decisions, in a boardroom row that threatens to undermine the bank's efforts to return to full health.
The row became public this week with the exit of Chairman Giuseppe Tesauro who, in remarks to two newspapers, accused CEO Paolo Fiorentino of acting too independently and wanting to turn Carige into ""a public company where he alone has a say"".
The Genoa-based bank has long been dogged by governance issues and hired Fiorentino a year ago to turn itself around. A former UniCredit banker, he pulled off a risky capital increase in December to stave off a risk that the bank could be wound down.
""All of the many decisions that have been taken over the past year have gone through the board and on some key moves there have multiple board discussions,"" Fiorentino told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""We've also introduced preparatory board meetings ahead of the actual approval of given measures.""
Earlier, in comments published in La Stampa and Il Sole 24 Ore, outgoing chairman Tesauro said Fiorentino had made his job almost impossible by withholding information. Attempts by Reuters to reach Tesauro for comment were not immediately successful.
Carige said on Tuesday the chairman had resigned over disagreements on the bank's governance and management. On Wednesday, also independent director Stefano Lunardi resigned citing the same reasons. The announcement came after Reuters spoke to Fiorentino.
""I found it odd that Tesauro spoke of a public company,"" the CEO said.
""If he means that Carige is trying to make sure all shareholders, small and large, receive the same amount of information and equal protection of their interests then that's one of my goals and one of my duties and the top shareholder is behind me on that,"" he added.
He said he spoke frequently with Malacalza, who is Carige's deputy chairman and the top shareholders with a 20.6 percent stake after backing two cash calls in the past three years.
Fiorentino arrived at Carige in July 2017 after Malacalza fell out with the previous CEO Guido Bastianini. A local businessman, Malacalza had also pushed out Bastianini's predecessor.
""There is an active relationship (with Malacalza) both within the board and in private meetings ... I was named by the board and I'll go on doing my job as long as I have the board's support.""

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Worsening trade row deepens chill felt by Chinese dealmakers seeking to do U.S. takeovers,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The rapidly deteriorating trade and investment relationship between Washington and Beijing is sending a further chill through Chinese dealmakers who have already seen the number of Chinese acquisitions of American assets take a big hit.
So far this year, Chinese companies have spent just $1.6 billion on U.S. assets, down almost 80 per cent from the year-earlier period, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast the amount China has spent on European assets has risen 39 per cent from last year to $45.1 billion.
""We are now focusing on Europe-bound deals and having U.S. deals on hold. The trade war between China and U.S., if not short-term, will be a mid-term thing and will take some time to conclude,"" said Lin Feng, founder and CEO of Chinese investment and advisory firm DealGlobe.
""Opportunities in the U.S. will be more small investments, or joint ventures in China. It will definitely hurt significant minority stake acquisitions, but on the other hand it may help targets in Europe and Israel,"" he added.
In 2016, which stands as the record for Chinese cross-border dealmaking, China acquired U.S assets worth $62.6 billion and spent $88.4 billion on European assets.
Since then, China's imposition of capital controls and in particular a regulatory crackdown on some of its most acquisitive companies, such as HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], Dalian Wanda Group Co and Anbang Insurance Group [ANBANG.UL], have badly dented Chinese investment flows heading for American shores.
FURTHER DETERRENT
The rejection by Washington of some major deals on national security grounds have only acted as a further deterrent to bankers and the Chinese companies they advise.
And this week, Washington has been signaling there will be tougher restrictions on Chinese investment, especially in sensitive areas of the economy, such as technology.
On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill to tighten foreign investment rules, spurred by bipartisan concerns about Chinese attempts to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology.
Then on Friday, the Trump administration is due to issue to proposed new restrictions on foreign investment in U.S. technology companies.
And there is also the escalating tit-fot-tat trade dispute, in which the United States has threatened to impose duties on up to $450 billion of Chinese imports, with the first $34 billion portion set to go into effect next month.
MORE HOSTILE Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office early last year, dealmakers have steadily become accustomed to a more hostile U.S environment.
Headline deals blocked by Washington in recent months included, notably, the $1.2 billion acquisition of Moneygram International (O:MGI) by China's Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL] in January. Delays in gaining approval led to the abandonment of a plan for HNA to buy a $200 million stake in Skybridge Capital LLC, a hedge fund founded by Trump's former aide Anthony Scaramucci.
Other scrapped deals have ranged from a $25 million bid for a stake in the Chicago Stock Exchange, which was blocked by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to a $16.5 million offer for a U.S. pig breeder
The door is not entirely closed, though. This month the U.S. approved the $2.7 billion takeover of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial (N:GNW) by China Oceanwide Holdings Group [OWREAC.UL] - a deal first struck in October 2016.
And dealmakers remain hopeful that any easing in the current tensions could boost China-U.S. deal volumes once more.
""This may not be the best timing. When the trade war is over, people will come back,"" said Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS (S:UBSG). ""Investors will continue to seek to identify attractive assets in the U.S.""
A senior executive with a Hong Kong-based investment firm confirmed he was still looking at U.S. deals. The new U.S. measures ""will definitely impact future deals and curb China's enthusiasm,"" he said. ""but we are still engaged in conversations.""
Another executive at the private equity arm of a Chinese state bank said the firm is also still actively studying U.S. deals.
""We are trying to see how we can participate,"" she said. ""Maybe we will just go for a very small stake.""
Still, investments in technology have become a whole front in their own right in what some bankers consider a ""cold war"" for cross-border deals in the sector.
Reuters reported this week that China has begun downplaying Made in China 2025 - a key policy designed, among other things, to back overseas investment in key sectors, but which had provoked alarm in the West.
""Many of our tech clients understand the prospects. They are all cautious and will not pursue big investments at this point in time,"" said one senior Hong Kong-based investment banker. Chinese investors have announced just five U.S. technology company acquisitions so far this year, totaling just $278 million, Thomson Reuters data shows - the lowest figure in five years.
Mind you, Joseph Gallagher, head of Asia Pacific M&A at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) (CSAG.UL), noted that issues around tech deals were not only a U.S.-China issue as European governments are also wary of China getting hold of key technology.

""Europe is becoming more difficult for Chinese acquisitions as well,"" he said. "" If the tech cold war went away, there would be significant tech M&A activity, but that's not likely to happen.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Airlines is in talks with 12-13 Turkish and Chinese banks to secure between $800 million and $1 billion in financing to construct its facilities at Istanbul's new airport, and a deal is almost ready, three sources close to the matter said.
Istanbul's third airport, which Turkey says will become the biggest in the world, is slated to open on Oct. 29. A total of 10.25 billion euros ($11.96 billion) have been invested in the airport, which will have an initial passenger capacity of 90 million per year.
Turkish Airlines is in talks with five local banks and various Chinese banks, including ICBC (IS:ICBCT) (SS:601398), the sources told Reuters. Two of them said the other four Turkish lenders to provide financing were Is Bank (IS:ISCTR), Yapi Kredi (IS:YKBNK), Alternatifbank and Ziraat Katilim.
ICBC confirmed that it provided financing but other banks mentioned did not respond to a request for comment.
The airline's shares were up 3 percent at 13.33 lira per share as of 0915 GMT, with more than 40 million shares traded.
The main BIST100 (XU100) index was up 0.63 percent.
Turkish Airlines did not respond to a request for comment.
""(Turkish Airlines) will make investments in buildings, customer sale offices, conveyor belts, and needs financing for them,"" one of the sources said. 
The deal is expected to be signed in July, another source said.
Chinese banks are eager to provide financing, another of the sources said, adding that maturity terms for the loans were between three to five years with a grace period of one year.
MEGA-PROJECTS
The third airport is among a series of mega-projects promoted by President Tayyip Erodogan, who won a new five-year term in Turkey's presidential election on Sunday.
Other big infrastructure projects include a third bridge across the Bosphorus, which opened in 2016, and plans to build a huge canal in Istanbul that would render a large chunk of the city an island.
Incoming flights will be directed to the new airport from the existing Ataturk Airport as soon as the new one opens on Oct. 29. The transition to the new site will be completed in 48 hours, officials say. Ataturk Airport is set to close down.
Like Ataturk, the new airport, which has not yet been named, is on the European side of Istanbul, a city of some 15 million people that straddles Europe and Asia. Istanbul's other airport, Sabiha Gokcen, is on the Asian side of the city. 
Turkish Airlines said in May that it had a loss of 314 million lira ($67.98 million) in the first quarter of the year, narrowing 78 percent from the loss in the same period a year earlier. Results showed first-quarter sales had climbed 44 percent to 10.53 billion lira.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",China's banks embrace Communist Party committees in risk crackdown,"By Matthew Miller
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's listed mid-tier and regional banks will face added pressure to curb risky activities following the formal establishment of Communist Party Committees at the lenders, bankers and analysts say.
China's 40 listed banks have announced changes to their articles of association to add the committees, with 26 making announcements after the start of the year.
Many specified that the organizations would be consulted before corporate strategy is agreed upon. 
While party committees have been set up across state-backed listed firms, their official establishment at banks comes as President Xi Jinping has targeted the industry and prioritized cutting financial risk. 
""Tighter party discipline doubtless will provide added teeth to the financial crackdown, increasing personal accountability of financial managers,"" said James Stent, a former external supervisor at China Everbright Bank (SS:601818) and independent director at China Minsheng Banking Corp (SS:600016).
In their proposals, many banks stipulated the creation of in-house discipline inspection committees - organizations responsible for overseeing the conduct and punishment of Communist Party members.
Under Xi, China has been revitalizing the party's role in Chinese institutions and society.
China Construction Bank Corp's (SS:601939) (HK:0939) discipline inspection committee announced in April a campaign to root out corrupt credit practices, focusing on branch business operations, loan and risk management, and internal compliance. 
Xu Jia'ai, head of discipline inspection at China's central bank, this year warned that a ""lack of strict party governance"" had contributed to major risks in the financial system, including weak supervision and illegal fundraising.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) is demanding that institutions take greater responsibility for loans, guarantees and investments.
Last month, officials from the regulator admonished bankers at a meeting in Beijing to ""steadily rectify market chaos"" and clamp down on ""illegal activities."" Those violating the law would be met with ""severe penalties,"" according to a notice on the regulator's website.
""The message was clear,"" said one executive who attended the meeting. ""Bankers will be held personally responsible.""
The regulator last month also launched a nationwide inspection of financial institutions, led by trust firms, to clean up the channeling of deposits into higher-yield, riskier investments. 
The CBIRC has begun ramping up punishments, handing out in December a $109 million penalty - its biggest ever - to China Guangfa Bank after a branch fabricated guarantees for 1 billion yuan in bonds that later went bust.
BRUNT OF CRACKDOWN
Earlier this decade, mid-tier and regional banks were the lenders that most aggressively expanded their balance sheets via the shadow banking system to compete against bigger rivals.
At Shengjing Bank Co (HK:2066), whose assets more than doubled over the last three years to 1 trillion yuan ($151.62 billion), financial investments categorized as receivables – typically shadow loan products - represented more than 20 percent of the total at the end of last year. 
At Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co (SS:600000), which shrank its shadow loan book by about one-third last year, loan-like credit assets still amounted to 581.7 billion yuan at the end of 2017.
Analysts have warned those institutions could bear the brunt of any crackdown by party committees as the government rolls out new measures to raise risk management standards.
At China Zheshang Bank (HK:2016), a Hangzhou-based regional lender which also saw its total assets more than double between 2014 and 2017, the Party committee will not only ""strengthen its leadership and supervision"" in the selection and discipline of personnel, but also participate in bank strategy. 
""The Bank should listen to the opinions of the Zheshang Bank Party Committee before discussing and deciding on major issues,"" the bank's amended articles of association stated, according to a May filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The formalization of the party committees has split investors and governance experts. While few welcome the Communist Party's tightening grip, some argue that bringing their workings into the light will make companies more transparent. But others fear a further loss of investor influence, said Fraser Howie, an independent China market analyst and author. 
""The Party is outside shareholder control,"" Howie said. ""To the extent the Party is exercising control of what a listed company is doing, to that extent shareholders are having their rights diluted or usurped.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Fears over higher global barriers to trade sent European stocks to 11-week lows on Wednesday, with little other company and economic news to provide relief from rising protectionism which has hit equity markets hard.
Europe's falls came after Asian stocks sold off violently on trade fears, with Chinese blue-chips hitting a 13-month low. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended its opening fall to 0.6 percent by 0830 GMT, hitting its lowest level since April 12 as financials and industrials stocks suffered. 
The banks sector (SX7P) was the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent as investors worried about the impact of protectionism on the economy and a flattening yield curve on banks' margins.
Bank shares fell to their lowest since December 2016 while the autos sector, a prominent target of higher U.S. tariffs, neared a 10-month low.
""This is for sure an environment in which the market has been able to ignore protectionist concerns, but I believe it's escalated to the point where it's hard to ignore now,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
Autos stocks (SXAP) fell 1.1 percent and drove Germany's DAX down 0.8 percent as BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) declined. 
Industrials Airbus (PA:AIR),  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and ABB (S:ABBN) were also big drags on the index, continuing their fall as investors priced in a more difficult trade environment for big exporters. 
Energy stocks (SXEP) helped limit losses, rising 1 percent as crude prices climbed on supply disruption in Canada and after U.S. officials told importers to stop buying Iranian crude from November. [nL4N1TT1AJ]
 BP  (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) were the biggest gainers in the market.
Shares in takeover target IWG (L:IWG), the British workspace firm, fell 4.3 percent after it warned on profit, blaming the cost of opening new space and a weak performance in Britain.
Traders said the takeover interest from private equity firms Terra Firma and TDR Capital among others were supporting the stock despite the profit warning.
With economic and company news relatively thin on the ground, broker recommendations also drove some big moves. 
 Imerys  (PA:IMTP) shares rose 3.8 percent after analysts at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) upgraded the mineral extracting and processing company to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"". 
Shares in French oil storage and distribution company  Rubis  (PA:RUBF) fell 5.5 percent after Berenberg cut the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy, saying weakness in the oil storage business is likely to persist in the short- to medium-term. 
Czech utility CEZ (PR:CEZP) traded ex-dividend, down 5.3 percent.
Overall, investors have been pulling billions out of European stocks and shifting into U.S. stocks in recent weeks as trade tensions ratcheted up. 
A global investor confidence index by State Street dropped in June, with the decline in sentiment largely driven by a significant fall in European investors' confidence. 
""Right now the environment is more positive for U.S. stocks but that could change fairly quickly,"" said Invesco's Hooper, adding: ""One of the key themes this year is rotation of leadership."" 

Analysts have been upgrading their earnings expectations for European stocks in the past weeks despite building trade tensions.

1358,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Sees ‘Rolling Bear’ Reaching High-Quality Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening, and a less-synchronized global economic expansion, is dealing a series of blows to financial markets in a pattern that ultimately will encompass higher-quality U.S. stocks, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Riskier assets have been hit first, before investors move on to securities perceived as safer, chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. While emerging-market equities have been hammered this month, the U.S. S&P 500 Index is still up for June.
“That’s basically our call for the year -- that we are in a kind of rolling-bear market,” Wilson said on the “Bloomberg Markets” show. “We are not seeing an ’08 scenario where everything gets hit at once; it’s selectively hitting markets one by one and it’s a rolling sort of correction.”
The recent sell-off in U.S. technology stocks is an example of that, Wilson said. The U.S. tech sector has been the only one in the U.S. to see valuations climb this year as money flowed into better-quality stocks, he said. Now, “maybe even some of these highest-quality stocks have gotten too expansive and maybe need to be hit a little bit,” he said.
The failure of 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to hold above 3 percent over the past several weeks is a key sign of investors’ shift in sentiment, according to Wilson. Morgan Stanley last week concluded the peak for the year is now already behind for the benchmark, amid brewing trade tensions and a stronger dollar.
“The fact that it can’t get above 3 percent, that’s concerning,” he said. “It’s signaling two things: number one, that growth is peaking -- doesn’t mean recession; and number two, that the Fed may be further along than people think, that they have tightened a lot already -- because don’t forget their balance sheet is reducing at the same time as they are raising interest rates. And that’s draining liquidity.”
One section of the market that may be protected against the rolling bear is U.S. small caps, he said. Relative earnings growth for those companies is going to be superior this year because of tax cuts, he said. And being more domestically focused, they are seen less vulnerable to hits from Trump administration trade policies.
Wilson anticipates a more aggressive rotation into defensive stocks such as utilities, telecom services, health care and consumer staples as growth slows and the U.S. Treasury yield curve heads toward inversion.

""The financial planners stood to receive higher commissions ... whilst at the same time exposing the clients unnecessarily to underwriting and associated risk,"" the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said in a statement.
In a federal court filing made public by ASIC, the regulator said six AMP employees advised about 40 life insurance customers to take out new policies which involved downgrading their level of cover in exchange for higher commissions from 2012 to 2013.
By selling weaker insurance policies for higher commissions, AMP's financial planners had ""failed to act in the best interests of the clients and to prioritize the interests of the clients"", ASIC said.
The regulator said it was seeking fines and court declarations that AMP failed to take all necessary steps to ensure its planners acted ""efficiently, honestly and fairly"" and within the law.
AMP said it had been co-operating with an ASIC investigation into the practice of insurance ""rewriting"" since 2014 and that it would ""file its defense in due course"".
The wealth manager had removed authorization in 2014 from the only financial planner named in ASIC's filing, and reported the individual's conduct to ASIC in the same year, AMP added.

It said it was ""apologizing to the customers impacted"" and that ""they are currently being compensated"".

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>","Trade war or not, China Inc already reining in American brands","By Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As Beijing and Washington veer towards a full-blown trade war, American brands in China face what may be an even bigger threat: local rivals armed with innovative products and the Chinese government's blessing.
American household names like Apple (O:AAPL), Starbucks (O:SBUX) and Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) Pampers are seeing their dominance challenged, a potential threat to the hundreds of billions of dollars U.S. firms make in China.
According to an analysis of data from Bain and Kantar, local brands snatched almost three-quarters of China's 639 billion yuan ($97 billion) market for fast-moving consumer goods - a category that includes items like soft drinks and shampoo - last year, up from two-thirds in 2013.
The data, shared with Reuters, shows that U.S. products like Pampers, Colgate (N:CL) toothpaste and Mead Johnson infant formula saw their market share drop around 10 percentage points in the past five years. The data was based on a survey of 40,000 urban households.
At the same time, savvy Chinese brands like SeeYoung, offering a popular silicon-free shampoo, and Pechoin, a maker of skincare products that plays up local ingredients, gained rapidly. 
""Local competition is now extremely high on the agenda of foreign firms in China,"" said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner with Bain & Co, the consultancy that co-authored the report.
""In order to win in China now they need to beat not just traditional competitors,"" he said. ""But they need to win against local companies that are faster and more innovative than they had realized.""
American brands have long enjoyed a vaunted status in China. U.S. fast food, beverages and coffee chains are ubiquitous in China's cities, while consumers lap up U.S.-branded infant formula, designer jeans, cars and smartphones.
That dominance, however, is threatened by China's push to bolster domestic brands by creating champions in certain categories and weeding out weaker players to improve quality.
Brewing trade tensions could exacerbate this slippage, threatening more than $180 billion in sales by U.S. firms in China last year, according to an analysis of 121 U.S.-listed American firms that broke out data for China sales in the most recent fiscal year. 
The total is likely far higher as many U.S. firms with a major China presence - including Starbucks, McDonald's (N:MCD) and Walmart (N:WMT) - don't break out China sales.
Apple made $44.8 billion in China in the last fiscal year, P&G around $5.2 billion and the sports apparel maker  Nike  (N:NKE) $4.2 billion. 
A trade war now looks more likely after talks in Beijing and Washington failed to defuse grating issues between the two countries over a trade imbalance, technology transfers and barriers that firms face doing business in China.
GROWTH TO ZERO
But the bigger threat might be the advances made by Chinese rivals.
Apple's iconic iPhone has seen its share of the country's smartphone market stall at around 10 percent since 2012, according to data from the analytics firm Canalys, and has been overtaken by upstart domestic phone makers like Oppo, Vivo and the more established Huawei [HWT.UL].
Starbucks, which boomed in China on the back of a budding coffee culture, said its same store sales growth in the country slowed to zero in the second quarter of 2018. The firm cited delivery issues, but it has also been facing a rising tide of small, fast-growing domestic rivals in China's big cities.
It's not only U.S. brands that are feeling the squeeze. A European trade body recently cited ""stiffer competition"" from Chinese rivals as one of the main anxieties felt by European brands.
And some firms have bucked the trend. The biscuit brand Oreo remains strong in the market, while Coca-Cola (N:KO) and Pepsi (O:PEP) recovered last year after losing ground between 2012 and 2016 to juice and water drinks seen as more healthy.
Overall, local brands gained market share over international rivals last year in 21 product consumer product categories like skin care, shampoo and infant formula, according to the Bain report. Local brands grew 7.7 percent last year versus tepid 0.4 percent growth for overseas rivals.
""That's definitely a trend,"" said a senior executive at a major U.S. consumer goods firm, adding that the biggest challenge his firm faced in China was strong domestic rivals.
GOING LOCAL
Chinese brands are getting increasingly confident about taking on overseas brands, including in high-tech sectors.
In China's auto market, the world's largest, domestic car brands - helped by supportive policies - have sneaked up on foreign brands over the past five years, challenging  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM), and the electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
The government's promotion of electric vehicles as a key industry has lured dozens of new Chinese competitors to enter the market.
Ian Zhu, a partner at NIO Capital, the investment affiliate of NIO, a Chinese electric vehicle start-up, said a shift to smart, electric and autonomous cars would bolster local brands as the vehicles increasingly become entertainment and work spaces rather than just a means of transport.
""You have to know local tastes and the local environment really well,"" he said. ""Foreign companies will have tremendous challenges in that.""
China's ""Made in China 2025"" push, which includes strategic areas including new energy and smart vehicles, is also helping local brands.
In other high-tech areas like medical devices, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, China is pushing its own domestic champions to trim reliance on overseas markets.
Many firms have responded by shifting production to China, which can give a brand quasi-local status.
""Most of what we sell is domestically produced,"" Ze Dias, China managing director for Kraft Heinz, told Reuters at the recent Shanghai launch of the firm's Jif Jaf biscuit, a China-only Oreo look-a-like with flavors including chocolate cheese and spicy chili.
Dias said the firm was exposed to some fluctuations in the commodities market related to trade tensions. Longer-term, however, he hoped the United States and China would resolve their issues.
""There are short-term bumps in the road,"" he said, but the United States and China ""will cooperate more than compete"".

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Asia shares sideswiped by China skid, oil extends gains","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets were under stress on Wednesday as further falls in Chinese stocks and the yuan sent ripples across the region, while oil climbed as the United States leaned on allies to stop buying Iranian crude.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) sank 2.2 percent to be a whisker above 13-month lows as a resolution of Sino-U.S. tensions remained a distant prospect.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) lost another 0.6 percent after touching a two-year trough on Tuesday. 
Japan's Nikkei (N225) had been faring better but soon succumbed to risk aversion and fell 0.3 percent.
European shares were expected to open flat, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were off 0.18 percent.
The fragile mood in Asia overshadowed gains in energy stocks made after news broke that Washington was pushing allies to halt imports of Iranian crude. 
U.S. crude (CLc1) added 17 cents to $70.70, having surged 3.6 percent overnight, while Brent (LCOc1) climbed 18 cents to $76.49 a barrel.
The jump in oil boosted the Wall Street energy sector 1.4 percent (SPNY), making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500.
But the S&P (SPX) still only managed to add 0.22 percent overall, while the Dow (DJI) rose 0.12 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) was up 0.39 percent.
Confusion remained the watchword with U.S. trade policy.
The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Tuesday to tighten foreign investment rules, spurred by bipartisan concerns about Chinese bids to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology.
Yet President Donald Trump also endorsed a measured approach to restricting Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies, saying a strengthened merger security review committee could protect sensitive technologies.
""We remain of the view that a large scale ""trade war"" remains a low probability though the odds of it happening appear to have increased,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist David Hensley.
He noted that the latest tariff threats from the White House would cover more than 30 percent of U.S. imports, equal to almost 5 percent of annual economic output (GDP).
""If all this were to happen, and U.S. trading partners were to retaliate, it would deliver a significant supply shock to the world economy, raising inflation and lowering growth.""
BACK TO YUAN WATCHING
In currency markets, trade-sensitive currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars lost ground while the safe-haven yen found demand. The kiwi dollar hit its lowest in seven months at $0.6812 .
The U.S. dollar was broadly steady against a basket of currencies at 94.661, after bouncing from 94.171 on Tuesday. The euro (EUR=) was back at $1.1650, having run into profit-taking at a top of $1.1720 overnight.
Yet the dollar could not sustain gains on the yen and eased back to 109.85 from an early 110.12 .
The dollar has been aided in part by recent gains on the Chinese yuan, which has stirred speculation Beijing was allowing its currency to weaken to bolster exports.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) fixed the yuan midpoint  at a six-month low of 6.5569 per dollar on Wednesday. That was down 0.6 percent from the previous fix but actually a little firmer than market expectations.
However, the spot rate continued to slip with the yuan breaking past 6.6600 per dollar for the first time since December.
""The PBOC's preference might be to allow moderate weakening, pulling back if depreciation pressures started intensifying. But that's a difficult balance to strike. The chances of a sizeable depreciation have risen,"" economists at Capital Economics said in a note.
In commodity markets, gold was seemingly no longer considered a safe haven by investors and hit its lowest in more than six months.

Spot gold  was last at $1,255.93 having hit its weakest since mid-December at $1,253.00.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested during a meeting with lawmakers that his administration may switch to foreign investment reviews under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States instead of imposing new limits on Chinese investment in U.S. technology.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","Canada's Sun Life sees Asia profit doubling, eyes bigger stake in China venture","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Canada's Sun Life Financial Inc expects to double its profit in Asia over the next five years on strong demand for insurance in key markets like China where it was keen to raise its ownership in a joint venture, its chief executive said. 
Asia is a battleground for foreign insurers including  Aviva  (LON:AV),  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc and Sun Life who are attracted by the region's lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums.
""We are bullish on not just the insurance business (in Asia), but wealth management and asset management as well,"" Dean Connor told Reuters, adding the company's post-tax profits of about C$450 million ($337.94 million) in Asia could double over five years.
Sun Life, which operates in seven Asian markets including China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and Malaysia, has in recent years made a series of deals in the region to acquire businesses or raise its ownership in several of those markets. 
Connor said Sun Life would like to increase its 25 percent holding in the Chinese insurance joint venture as a result of Beijing's plan to lift the ownership cap to 51 percent for foreign insurers.
Beijing said last year it planned to lift the ownership cap to 51 percent for foreign insurance joint ventures in 2020 and remove the limit completely two years later, which would allow for further expansion.
The regulatory guidelines for the stake hike by foreign insurers in their Chinese ventures have not been announced yet and there is no timeline on their implementation.
Sun Life Financial Asia accounted for 15 percent of the group's underlying net income in the first quarter of this year, according to financial reports posted on its website.
""We have grown rapidly organically but we have also invested around a billion dollars in capital in Asia ... We will continue to look for those kind of opportunities across Asia,"" Connor said, referring to the company's acquisition plans.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 10:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ackman makes fresh layoffs at Pershing Square hedge fund,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose investment assets have shrunk by more than half in the last three years, has made a second round of staff cuts and laid off three investor relations team members, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The prominent manager cut one investor relations executive and two investor services executives at his New York-based Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management hedge fund last week, the sources said. These layoffs come after Ackman cut his staff by 10 people in January, shrinking the firm to 46 employees from 56.
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
The fresh round of layoffs shows that Ackman, one of the industry's most voluble activist investors, is moving forward with an overhaul that some had questioned but has so far been successful, involving both cost cuts and investment strategy changes.
Pershing Square now oversees roughly $8 billion in assets, less than half the amount it managed at its peak in 2015. Assets dwindled after three years of losses which prompted many investors to ask for some of their money back.
Unlike other managers who might try to replace departing capital, Ackman decided to re-tool his firm, telling clients that he wants to return to his roots by running a smaller firm and growing assets only through improved returns not by bringing in new investors.
In addition to the layoffs, key members of his team have voluntarily left.
Investment team member Ali Namvar retired and Vice Chairman Steve Fraidin returned to practicing law as a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
Investment team member Brian Welch is leaving at the end of this month. The investment team has historically had between eight and 10 members.
In his early years, Ackman dazzled with double-digit returns, often delivering some of the industry's best returns.
As part of the revamp, Ackman, one of the industry's most visible managers, said he would stay out of the limelight to concentrate on investments, leaving the visiting with clients to others. So far this year the firm has made bets on  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) and Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW).
So far Ackman's promises of delivering improved returns appear to be materializing. Through the middle of June, Pershing Square's private hedge fund was up more than 9 percent while the publicly traded fund, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd, was up 11.4 percent since the start of the year.

Australia is likely to bar Huawei from participating in a 5G mobile telecommunications roll-out as it fears the company is de facto controlled by Beijing and sensitive infrastructure will be vulnerable to eavesdropping, according to Australian media reports.
""Banning Huawei will not make the Australian telecom ecosystem safer, but will have a huge impact on the industry and the prices and services Australians receive,"" John Lord, chairman of Huawei's Australian unit, told Australian Associated Press on Wednesday.
""It will be a great policy failure and demonstrate to the world that we are not ready for the new reality of a smart and innovative China,"" said Lord, adding Huawei's products are ""safe and secure"".
The spat between Huawei and Australia's security agencies lands amid a low in Sino-Australian relations and intense concern at Chinese influence in Australian politics.
Huawei, whose chairman Lord, was a former Rear Admiral in Australia's Navy, emerged on Tuesday as the top corporate sponsor of international trips by Australian federal politicians.
Australia is preparing to pass laws designed to limit China's influence in domestic affairs following criticism by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that Beijing was interfering.
Turnbull said on Wednesday his government was still mulling Huawei's role in the country's nascent 5G network.
""We'll continue to consider that and get the best advice on that from our national security agencies,"" he said.
Huawei, the world's largest maker of telecommunications network equipment and the No. 3 smartphone supplier, has already been virtually shut out from the giant U.S. market because of national security concerns. 
It was blocked on security grounds from supplying equipment to Australia's new broadband network and Australia this month promised hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure Huawei did not build an internet cable between Australia and the Solomon Islands.

The diplomatic rift between Australia and China has spilled into the trade sphere in recent weeks as Australian wine exporters such as Treasury Wine Estates have faced delays getting some products through Chinese customs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) is facing more pressure over its handling of a fraud at its HBOS Reading business that took place more than a decade ago, with the chair of Britain's Treasury Committee calling for ""maximum transparency"" over the affair.
The intervention by committee chair Nicky Morgan follows the publication of an internal 2013 Lloyds report last week, which alleges serious misconduct by the bank over its handling and disclosure of the fraud.
Morgan, who described the report's allegations as ""deeply troubling"", has written to fellow member of parliament Kevin Hollinrake, saying the committee had taken a close interest in the case and could ""engage constructively"" with it once investigations into the matter have been completed. 
""It is then that we will have more clarity on who knew what, and when,"" she wrote, adding that she would press for speedy conclusions to the investigations and that specific allegations could then be put to the bank.
Morgan's intervention turns up the heat on Lloyds and regulators over the fraud, one of Britain's worst-ever banking scandals for which six people were jailed for a total of 47 years last year.
A Lloyds spokesman said on Wednesday the bank supported the investigations into the fraud, welcomed Morgan's statement and would assist the committee in its consideration of the matter.
""Lloyds Banking Group remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee's desire for transparency,"" the spokesman said in a statement.  
A cross-party group of lawmakers, headed by Hollinrake, last week called for ""full, forensic and expeditious"" investigations by regulators and law enforcement agencies into the report's allegations.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud, while a retired judge Linda Dobbs is looking at whether Lloyds properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009. Britain's National Crime Agency has also expanded a review into the fraud. 
The fraud, which took place in the early 2000s, enabled the conspirators to enrich themselves at the expense of the bank's business clients. 
Morgan has also written to Dobbs to ask when her Lloyds-commissioned review into the matter would be complete. Morgan also said the committee would expect to see her full, unredacted findings in the same form as they are presented to the FCA.
The allegations in the Lloyds' internal report could have far-reaching implications given Lloyds' takeover of HBOS in 2009. 
Written by a former Lloyds manager, the report says that had HBOS properly disclosed the fraud in 2007, a 4 billion pound ($5.30 billion) 2008 rights issue that stabilized its financial position, and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds, would not have happened.
The report has circulated privately among regulators and law enforcement officials for years but has not been made available to the public. Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a critic of Britain's big banks, published the report online last week, saying it was in the public interest.
Morgan has also written to Russel Griggs, an independent professor appointed by Lloyds to manage a compensation scheme for the victims of the fraud, asking for details on his progress on settling victims claims. 
""It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long to come to light,"" she said in a statement.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",GE's determined makeover could dim deal prospects,"By Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) plan to divest $20 billion worth of assets may have bankers excited about contacting potential buyers, breaking off other big chunks of the conglomerate, and creating an M&A bonanza. 
GE's message to dealmakers: Not so fast.
The company is wedded to a plan it outlined Tuesday to sell 20 percent of its healthcare unit and distribute the other 80 percent to shareholders through a tax-efficient spinoff, people familiar with management's thinking said.
Tax concerns make GE wary of entertaining other options for its healthcare business, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. 
A provision related to the majority stake GE owns in oil-services company  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) led to the plan it announced on Tuesday to gradually sell the stake down over 2-3 years, they said.
In an interview, GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery would not rule out selling the healthcare unit or the Baker Hughes stake, but said the company intends to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders can still benefit from future growth.
“Our intention is to take it out as a stand-alone company,"" Flannery told Reuters when asked if a sale was a possibility. ""My world view is there’s no such thing as ruling out any option, but that’s not our intention,
""We want to get these out into shareholders hands where they can grow more quickly.”
GE's slow-and-steady divestiture plan tracks the approach it has taken under Flannery who took the helm last August.
For instance, when GE announced plans to sell its transportation business to Wabtec in an $11.1 billion last month, it kept a chunk of the business for itself and shareholders.
The company is open to smaller divestitures, and several are in process, including GE's lighting division, parts of its project finance unit Energy Financial Services, its aerospace parts group Middle River, and its offshore positioning systems unit Converteam.
Those transactions will only generate between $1 billion and $3 billion each, people familiar with the businesses said. Altogether, GE will probably generate another $5 billion or so in cash through more marginal deals.
The most problematic asset GE is trying to sell is its insurance business, which has incurred hefty charges, sparked shareholder lawsuits, and an investigation by U.S. regulators. Insurance liabilities stood at $38 billion at the end of 2017, according to GE's annual report, though it is unclear how such a deal would be structured or valued, bankers said.
TWO GEMS
There is already interest in GE's two gems – its healthcare unit and Baker Hughes – but each has complications preventing an outright sale.
In April, medical equipment maker Danaher Corp (N:DHR) approached GE about potentially acquiring the life sciences division of its healthcare unit, a major source of sales that makes X-ray machines and hospital equipment, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Danaher's approach.
GE did not entertain talks at the time and remains unconvinced that any offer would be able to match how much the tax-efficient spinoff will earn for shareholders, the person said.
Another acquirer that could express interest in the healthcare unit is Thermo Fisher Scientific (N:TMO), according to a separate person familiar with the matter.
But GE plans to put roughly $18 billion of debt and pension obligations on the spinoff company, something that could dampen enthusiasm among potential buyers.
For Baker Hughes, instead of an outright sale, GE will likely either hold an initial public offering or organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors.
The company plans to stick to a lockup agreement it struck when acquiring the stake to remain a co-owner at least until 2019, the people said. Although the oil-services industry has come under pressure from falling commodity prices, GE sees potential in the business from cost cuts and growing customer relationships, they said.
Even if GE wanted to find a single buyer for the stake, it would be tough.

The only two strategic buyers, Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) and  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), would face major antitrust challenges, analysts said. Plus, there are few players out there with the resources to acquire the huge stake, worth $22 billion on Tuesday.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>","Put on probation, Uber wins London license to avoid ban","By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc won a probationary license to operate in London on Tuesday in a partial victory for its new chief executive after it made changes to ease strained relations with city authorities.
The new license was subject to strict conditions, however, and came with a warning to prove it had changed to retain its right to operate in London, the heart of its biggest European market.
Uber overhauled its policies and personnel in Britain after Transport for London (TfL) refused to renew its license in September for failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers. 
The ruling has been a test of Uber's new senior management, with Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took charge the month before TfL's decision, pledging to ""make things right"" in London. 
Judge Emma Arbuthnot said that changes made by its London subsidiary in light of the ruling were sufficient for Uber to be considered ""fit and proper"" to operate as she granted a 15-month ""probationary"" license.
The license is much shorter than the five-year license it was denied in September, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan was clear that the court ruling was no carte blanche for Uber in London.
""I believe everyone must play by the same rules, no matter how big or powerful they are,"" he said in a statement. 
""Uber has been put on probation – their 15 month license has a clear set of conditions that TfL will thoroughly monitor and enforce."" 
TfL said it was considering the court's decision and that the conditions would let it take action if Uber failed to meet standards.
The license conditions for Uber London Limited (ULL) include implementing a new governance structure, giving TfL notice of what Uber is doing in areas that may be a cause of concern, reporting safety related complaints and having an independent assurance audit report every six months. 
ULL must also be notified by its parent firm of any matters that could be relevant to its obligations as an operator.
With backers including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and BlackRock (N:BLK) and valued at more than $70 billion, Uber has faced protests, bans and restrictions around the world as it challenges traditional taxi operators, angering some unions.
Uber, which has about 45,000 drivers in London, introduced several new initiatives in response to the ruling, including 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to police. It has also changed senior management in Britain, though it was allowed to continue operating in London while the appeal process was ongoing.
Uber's work with London authorities is part of a broader shift by the company to engage with regulators rather than bulldoze them. It has also started discussions with regulators in New York City about a cap on the number of cars the service is allowed, which previous chief executive Travis Kalanick had resisted.
Mayor Khan said that as a result of the initial London ruling, ""Uber has been forced to overhaul the way it operates not just in London but across the world."" 
""UBER IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING""
Uber had originally reacted with indignation at TfL's decision last year, saying authorities had ""caved in"" to its critics. 
But officials struck a more conciliatory tone at the court hearing, accepting both that TfL's original decision was right and that a shorter license was appropriate. Tom Elvidge, General Manager of Uber in the UK, welcomed Tuesday's ruling.
""We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust,"" he said.
Elvidge and other Uber officials told the court Khosrowshahi had helped to change the culture of the firm after he was appointed last year, and judge Arbuthnot noted that the then-new chief executive had apologized in person to TfL in October.
Shawn Carolan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, an Uber investor, said the ruling was ""a great testament to the progress Uber has made in engaging with city government under Dara's leadership.""
But others said that Uber was playing catch-up. Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant based in New York and the former deputy commissioner for traffic and planning for New York City, said that Uber should have done more to work with authorities earlier.
""It's an occasion for one-handed applause because this should have happened all along,"" he said, adding that it was understandable that TfL wanted to keep Uber on a short leash.
Western Europe is an increasingly important market to Uber. It has pulled out of China, Russia and Southeast Asia, and its future in India, where it battles local rival Ola, is in question. 
But Uber's presence in London has angered the drivers of the city's iconic ""black cabs"", who have previously blocked London's streets in protest at the app.
The Licensed Taxi Driver's Association (LTDA), whose lawyer in court warned about the prospect of an ""Uber in sheep's clothing"", said it was disappointed with the decision.
""Uber's blatant disregard for TfL's regulations and public safety was laid before the Court,"" said Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the LTDA.
""The justice system has failed Londoners today and let an aggressive multinational corporation win.""

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 06:29PM ET</span>",The culture clash behind GE's quick exit from Baker Hughes stake,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - When  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co bought oilfield services giant Baker Hughes last July, it created a global industry colossus with $22 billion in annual revenue.
GE promised to digitalize oilfields worldwide, marrying its expertise in big data, analytical software and subsea equipment with Baker Hughes' experience in drilling services, chemicals and tools.
Less than a year later, GE is bailing out of the deal, the firm announced Tuesday, planning to sell its 63 percent stake in the combined firm over time as part of a larger move to simplify its business and reduce debt.
The retreat comes amid slipping market share, management missteps and culture clashes that have unsettled employees and frustrated suppliers and customers, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with more than 30 employees, former employees, recruiters, analysts, suppliers and customers.
GE managers initially took 11 of the combined firm's top 15 posts and ushered in a by-the-book culture more like its aviation business than that of oil industry, where relationships are more prized and handshake deals are still common, said people who have had dealings with both.
In a Tuesday note to employees seen by Reuters, Baker Hughes GE Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli complimented his ""amazing team"" and reassured them about the path ahead, but acknowledged ""the last year has not always been easy for you, or our customers and partners.""
""I recognize that this moment is bittersweet for some, welcomed perhaps by others,"" he wrote.
Baker Hughes GE lost market share in 12 of 19 services and equipment sectors between 2016 and 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of data from prominent oilfield services consultancy Spears & Associates. In one area where Baker Hughes has been a pioneer, drill bits, its share fell to 17 percent from 20 percent between 2016 and 2017.
In a statement to Reuters, Baker Hughes GE attributed the market share losses to ""challenging market dynamics"" and said most of the losses occurred before the merger closed in summer of last year.
Since the merger, suppliers have chafed under strict cost-cutting demands, and some customers shifted to competitors after abrupt service-fee increases and contract changes, according to suppliers, customers and former Baker Hughes executives. The choppy transition also has driven out veteran Baker Hughes managers in key departments and rattled staff.
Revenue for the combined company last year was $21.9 billion, well below the $23.8 billion estimated in its 2017 merger proxy.
Baker Hughes GE oilfield services and equipment revenues declined by $700 million. Rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted higher revenues on a resurgence in the North American hydraulic fracturing market, said Chirag Rathi, a consulting director at market researcher Frost & Sullivan. Baker Hughes sold a majority of its hydraulic fracturing business in 2016.
Baker Hughes GE said its financial performance reflects broader industry trends and called itself a ""strong and differentiated company"" that now has a ""defined path"" to unwind the merger over the next two or three years. It said it would stay focused on supporting workers, customers and boosting shareholder value.
Baker Hughes GE's shares were up 2 percent to $33.13 on Tuesday, but still down nearly 18 percent since the merger closed.
The company will now set about dividing itself before ever fully integrating the two firms. While the combined culture remains a work in progress, ""the old Baker Hughes structure has been torn apart,"" said Edward Muztafago, director of equity research at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
It remains unclear whether Baker Hughes will continue to benefit from GE's financial clout and advanced manufacturing over the long term. 
Last year, Baker Hughes landed a major deal with Twinza Oil to provide oilfield services, equipment and financing for an offshore development near Papua New Guinea. Analysts say access to credit and lending from GE Capital, a unit GE is now planning to shrink, helped that deal come together.
For now, Baker Hughes will continue to have access to vaunted GE technologies that were cited as key advantages in the original merger, including the GE Store, a technology and manufacturing exchange, and GE's Predix operating system, which links and monitors equipment through the internet, the company said. But the company said Tuesday it would also develop solutions independent of the Predix system.
ABRUPT PRICE HIKES, CONTRACT CHANGES
Shortly after the merger closed last year, Baker Hughes GE made an ""overnight"" decision to raise prices and internal sales targets, a former employee told Reuters. The moves, along with squeezing costs from supplier contracts, aimed to raise revenue and margins.
While oilfield margins have modestly improved, they still trail well behind those of top rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton, said Bernstein analyst Colin Davies, who noted the oil-price recovery has driven margin gains industrywide.
One privately-held U.S. oil producer that uses Baker Hughes GE's artificial lift products said the company raised its service prices by 20 percent late last year with little notice. The customer shifted some of its business to a rival, Novomet Inc, even after Baker Hughes GE agreed through negotiations to trim the increase.
""They're not managing the account as personally as they need to,"" the customer said, declining to be named because of ongoing business between the two firms.
Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on its pricing except to say it makes regular adjustments to stay competitive.
Suppliers also have faced post-merger changes to contract terms and procurement processes. One company told Reuters that Baker Hughes GE pressed for a 3.5 percent discount on goods and a 120-day grace period on payments, terms the company rejected. Normally, customers pay within 30 to 60 days, the supplier said.
One dispute escalated into a breach-of-contract lawsuit. Manufacturer Markall Inc built a successful business supplying components to Baker Hughes over four decades, but the relationship quickly deteriorated after the merger. 
In the suit, filed in November, Markall alleges Baker Hughes GE had not paid for more than $5 million in custom parts that it had agreed to buy before the merger.
Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it deals with issues predating the acquisition.
EXODUS OF EXECUTIVES
GE Chief Executive John Flannery, appointed shortly after the merger, foreshadowed Tuesday's announcement last November when he said the firm was considering its ""exit options"" just months after acquiring its controlling stake.
Then the company canceled a planned switch of former Baker employees to GE's healthcare plan, several former Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas employees told Reuters. A move to cut staff just ahead of end-of-year holidays also hurt morale, two former workers said.
Another sign of strain: the departure of veteran employees in key positions, according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the resignations.
More than 50 resumes from Baker Hughes employees have landed with one professional recruiter since last summer, according to a headhunter there.
Melissa Law - a 20-year Baker Hughes veteran and former president of its global chemicals business - joined food ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle (LON:TATE) last September. Eric Holcomb, formerly a Baker Hughes director of financial planning, left after more than a dozen years to join marine shipping company Kirby Corp in December.
Chief Global Operations Officer Belgacem Chariag - one of a handful of Baker Hughes executives to remain in senior management after the merger - resigned in January without announcing a new position. 
Chariag did not respond to a request for comment. Baker Hughes declined to comment on the departures but called its overall retention rates ""strong and in line with the market.""

The latest developments involving a trade dispute pitting the United States against China and other countries are creating such uncertainty that investors are struggling to value stocks at a time strong corporate profits would otherwise bolster stocks as the bull market extends into its 10th year. 
""The uncertainty regarding policy leads to uncertainty regarding profits,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. ""I’m not sure how one could say that trade is fully discounted because policy is being set somewhat randomly.""  
Although concerns over a global trade war have loomed over the stock market since March, the issue has barged into the foreground in recent days, as motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) and Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) warned of a financial toll from the trade tensions. 
Investors, meanwhile, are reconsidering whether statements from U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration may be more than just an effort to gain leverage in any trade negotiations.
""As it seems that this is not just a negotiating tactic - this could be reality - that is beginning to unnerve the market,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago.
The dilemma of weighing trade concerns was cast into stark relief for investors on Monday when the S&P 500 dove 2 percent amid conflicting signals from the Trump administration over proposed restrictions on foreign investment in U.S. technology companies. 
The benchmark index recovered somewhat to close down 1.4 percent, but still marked its biggest single-day decline in nearly three months. The S&P 500 rebounded modestly on Tuesday, ending up 0.2 percent.
INVESTOR NERVOUSNESS
Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey said the trade dispute was definitely making it harder to value the stocks. 
""Handicapping it is extremely difficult, and contributing to the overall nervousness of investors,"" he said. 
""It's given me pause about committing new capital and I'm in the position of a lot of investors where with these sell-offs, my first reaction is to step back rather than to leap in,"" Meckler said.
The S&P 500's current price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, is 16.7 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That makes stocks significantly cheaper than they were in January, when the index traded at 18.6 times estimates, but still more expensive than their long-term average of 15 times.
Trade has become one of the main uncertainties facing stock investors as they value stocks, along with the path of interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve, said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management LLC in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
""It is making it harder,"" Veru said. ""What sort of P/E do you put on a company? That's the struggle right now.""

Recent comments from Harley and Daimler indicate that the impact from tariffs could cloud the second-quarter earnings season starting in a few weeks in which S&P 500 companies are expected to increases profits by 20.7 percent, fueled by the recent U.S. corporate tax cuts. 
""This will be a huge topic,"" said J. Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. 
""CEOs are starting to think about how this affects them and what moves they're going to make ...,"" Evans said. ""It's very hard for them to plan anything with this uncertainty, but they have to move forward as if the current trend is going to continue for several more years.""
There does not seem to be as yet any significant impact from the trade uncertainty on analysts' projections for earnings. Analysts estimate earnings will rise by 22.4 percent for 2018, up from a 19.8 percent increase expected at the start of April, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

But some market strategists are beginning to project fallout from an intensified trade war. Using assumptions including a 10 percent increase in import costs stemming from heightened tariffs, BofA Merrill Lynch projects a 3-4 percent hit to S&P 500 earnings per share.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economists calculate that escalation of the trade dispute to include $200 billion of imports could reduce economic growth by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points, which translates to a 1 to 1.5 percent reduction in S&P 500 earnings growth.
Whether such projections become more relevant could become clear at the end of next week, when U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to go into effect. 
""The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading with Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker. We'll keep trading off if the trend persists.""
Some investors continue to doubt that the U.S.-China tensions will escalate into a full-blown trade war and that, given that Trump himself has measured his success by the stock market, the administration will be wary of policies that would seriously undermine stocks.
""You can still value stocks,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. ""You have to take a giant leap of faith that this so-called trade war won't unfold.""

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Ex-Akebia employee jailed for night as insider trading trial starts,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Akebia Therapeutics Inc (O:AKBA) employee accused of engaging in an insider trading scheme must spend a night in jail after he violated a U.S. judge's order and spoke to a witness at the start of his trial on Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ordered the detention of Schultz Chan, who has had prior issues following court directives, after asking why he could not heed her warnings to not talk to witnesses, as he did by saying hello to one.
""At this point you are interfering with the trial if your lawyer can't turn his back on you,"" Talwani said.
The development occurred shortly after jurors heard opening statements in the trial of Chan and Songjiang Wang, a former  Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc  (O:MACK) employee who prosecutors say participated in the insider trading scheme with Chan.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kriss Basil said both men shared inside information with each other about their respective companies' clinical drug trials in order to profit in the stock market when their employers announced the studies' results.
""That's cheating, and that's the fraud we intend to prove in this case,"" Basil said.
He said Wang, Merrimack's director of statistical programming, tipped his friend Chan, 54, three times in 2013 to 2014 about positive results in drug studies before the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company announced them.
Chan, in turn, bought Merrick stock, as did his wife and his landlord, Basil said. On one tip alone, Chan and his wife made $136,000 trading before Merrimack announced the results of a cancer drug study in May 2014, Basil said.
He said Wang, 54, also provided Chan money, which he used to buy Merrimack stock. In 2015, Chan wrote Wang a check for $84,000, representing his profits, Basil said.
When Chan in 2015 joined Cambridge-based Akebia as its director of biostatistics, he also traded in its own stock after learning about the results of study involving a drug to treat anemia patients who also had chronic kidney disease, Basil said.
Both men deny wrongdoing. Horstmann said Chan, the ""mayor of Nerd City,"" did not need inside information to know from studying public data that Akebia's drug would be successful, which is why he bought stock before he formally began his job.

""The information is out there in the public for someone like Mr. Chan with his experience to take advantage of it,"" he said.

Currencies also retreated and are heading toward their worst month since November 2016.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index sank to the lowest in 10 months, while 18 out of 24 currencies tracked by Bloomberg fell. The Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled 20 percent from its peak in January, with China joining nations such as Turkey and Pakistan in crossing that threshold. The risk premium on sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries widened.
Traders are grappling with conflicting signals after President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday at a less confrontational path toward curbing Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. technologies. His remarks seemed to favor the approach of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. Earlier, President Xi Jinping reportedly said he would strike back. In addition to tension between the world’s two biggest economies, traders are assessing a scenario of accelerated tightening by the Federal Reserve and impact of higher oil prices.
“This is a dangerous market,” said Jonathan Garner, Morgan Stanley’s chief Asia and emerging markets strategist. “We now think we’re heading to an outright bear market.”

1. Data Deluge Hits US Markets 
A deluge of top-tier U.S. economic data is slated for Wednesday which may help turn attention to domestic issues as tentative demand returned to risk assets, supporting a bounce in US stocks.
The Commerce Department releases its report on May core durable goods orders due 08:30 am ET forecast to show a 0.5% increase. While orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft – which serves as a proxy for business spending plans – is expected to show a 0.3% rise.
The preliminary report on U.S. trade balance for May due 8:30am is expected to show deficit widened to $68.90 billion.
Pending Home Sales due 10:00 am ET, meanwhile, is forecast to show 1.1% growth for May following a surprise 0.4% decline in the prior month.
While the slew of U.S. economic reports will be closely watched for signs of ongoing U.S. economic strength, any further developments on the trade tussle front will likely attract special attention.
The dollar continued to its climb Tuesday supported by a slump in the euro and weakness in the safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
2. U.S. Crude Oil Supplies in Focus 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show crude supplies fell for a third straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 2.572 million barrels in the week ended June 22. Domestic crude output – which remains at a record 10.9 million barrels per day – is also likely to garner investor attention.
Crude oil futures settled 3.6% higher at $70.53 on Tuesday as focus turned to the prospect of lower global supplies after the United States threatened ""powerful"" sanctions against countries that fail to halt Iranian crude imports by Nov. 4.
3. Tesla's Musk Steals Focus Away From Goldman's Bearish Update
Tesla bounced back from session lows as CEO Elon Musk piqued investor interest with an update on the upcoming production of pickup trucks.
Musk said in a tweet that the vehicle ""will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.""
The update from Musk overshadowed a bearish report from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), claiming the electric automaker would likely miss its guidance on Model 3 production.
Goldman Sachs maintained its sell rating on Tesla on expectations that Model 3 production rates – based on VIN registrations – would average around 2,200 per week in the second quarter, below both Tesla's guidance and an elevated consensus estimate, according to media reports.
Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed 2.70% higher at $342.00."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday criminally charged a Standard & Poor's credit ratings analyst and two friends, all from Manhattan, with insider trading related to Sherwin-Williams Co's $9.3 billion purchase of Valspar Corp.
According to prosecutors, the analyst Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz, 32, tipped Abell Oujaddou and Jeremy Millul in early March 2016 about the impending transaction between the two paint makers, after learning about it in confidential memos at work.
Oujaddou, 55, who runs an upscale Manhattan hair salon, and Millul, 31, who manages a jewelry boutique in Manhattan's Diamond District, allegedly made about $300,000 of illegal profit by buying Valspar shares and options, and selling them after the merger was announced on March 20, 2016.
Prosecutors also said that after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began examining trades in Valspar that occurred before the announcement, Pinto-Thomaz lied to S&P by denying he knew Oujaddou and Millul.
Sherwin-Williams, which is based in Cleveland, agreed to buy Valspar for $113 per share, 35 percent above where it traded before the all-cash merger was announced. Shares of Valspar rose about 23 percent on the next trading day.
S&P spokesman John Piecuch said Pinto-Thomaz has been suspended, and that the unit of S&P Global Inc is cooperating with authorities.
""We hold our employees to the highest standards of honesty and integrity and take adherence to our compliance policies very seriously,"" Piecuch said in a statement. 
A lawyer for Pinto-Thomaz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oujaddou's lawyer had no immediate comment. Michael Bachner, a lawyer for Millul, said his client denied wrongdoing and will defend himself.
All three defendants were arrested on Tuesday, and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy. Each faces up to 20 years in prison on the securities fraud counts.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the defendants.
Sherwin-Williams completed the purchase of Minneapolis-based Valspar on June 1, 2017, after divesting $431 million of assets.

The cases are U.S. v. Pinto-Thomaz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-mag-05432; and SEC v Pinto-Thomaz et al in the same court, No. 18-05757.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Ex-State Street executive convicted in U.S. of hidden fee fraud,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A former  State Street  Corp (N:STT) executive was convicted on Tuesday of participating in a scheme to defraud several of the bank's customers by charging them secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades. 
A federal jury in Boston found Ross McLellan, 46, guilty on five of six counts the one-time State Street executive vice president faced, including conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.
The verdict came on the second day of jury deliberations and followed a trial of about three weeks. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin scheduled McLellan's sentencing for Oct. 10.
""We're disappointed in the verdict and optimistic in an appeal that will include an enormous amount of significant issues, some of which are virtually unprecedented,"" said Martin Weinberg, McLellan's lawyer.
McLellan is one four ex-employees of the Boston-based bank who since 2016 have faced U.S. charges that they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars. 
Two of those former executives - Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt - pleaded guilty in 2017. Both agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testified against McLellan in hopes of leniency when they are sentenced.
The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six customers mark-ups on certain transactions. 
In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement.
According to prosecutors, from 2010 to 2011 McLellan, Pennings, Boomgaardt and others conspired to add the secret commissions for trades made for the six customers, which had been utilizing the bank's ""transition management"" business.
The service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments.
The six customers included the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds.
Prosecutors also claimed McLellan defrauded a New York-based unit of insurance company AXA SA (PA:AXAF) by applying hidden fees to trades conducted on its behalf. Jurors acquitted McLellan on the wire fraud charge related to that allegation.

Charges remain pending against a former State Street employee, Kevin Walker, accused of participating in the AXA fraud scheme with McLellan.

1409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",How to Make Money Off Brazilian Stocks When They Are Sinking,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s at least one way to make money and bet on Brazilian equities at the same time, even if the Ibovespa is down more than 7 percent this year.
Just ask investors in the ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil, or BZQ. The fund is up 40 percent year-to-date and is nearing a 12-month high. It gives investors twice the inverse performance of underlying Brazilian equities -- that means the more shares sink, the better the payout for buyers.
Brazilian assets are struggling with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in October, a more bearish outlook for the country’s economy and the prospect of tighter monetary policy in the U.S.
Recently, lower-than-expected economic growth and a weaker Brazilian real added a cautious note for earnings. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), UBS and Santander (MC:SAN) all mentioned downside risks to Brazilian company results. The country’s benchmark Ibovespa index fell almost 11 percent in May, the biggest monthly drop since September 2014. In June, the equity index has already slumped 8 percent.
Mark Mobius, co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners, said that he’s ""concerned"" about the potential slackening of reform movement in Brazil and that the nation’s stocks ""are not trading at bargain levels,"" suggesting they may have further to fall.
On June 8, investors traded over $11 million worth of BZQ, the most since May 2017 and more than 10 times the average daily turnover for the past year. Leveraged strategies are usually used by traders and reset their leverage daily to give new buyers the performance they anticipate, meaning the longer they’re held, the less accurately they track their benchmarks.

The KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF, or KBA, saw frenzied trading Tuesday after the benchmark index in Shanghai plunged into a bear market overnight. More than $62 million in shares changed hands by 2:52 p.m. in New York, roughly 11 times the daily average in the past year. The ETF fell 1.2 percent to the lowest level since June 2017.
It’s a stark reversal for a fund that saw $197 million in inflows during May after MSCI Inc. said it would include Chinese shares in its emerging-market index as of June 1. More than $1.9 trillion in assets track the index, according to MSCI’s website. But investors have pulled $12 million in the past two weeks, the first sign of outflows since February.
“KBA has been getting some love this year because it is literally holding stocks that are going into the MSCI index,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. “The question is, how much pain can people take day-to-day or month-to-month? And clearly, not everyone is going to have the same stomach for that.”
Selling has deepened as President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on as much as $450 billion of Chinese goods headed for the U.S. and the Treasury Department was reportedly planning curbs on Chinese investment in American technology. Economic data released two weeks ago missed expectations, heightening angst that the world’s largest economy was slowing.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co said on Tuesday it will spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes, effectively breaking up the 126-year-old conglomerate which was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power.
The slimmed-down company will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years.
""This is really the culmination of 10 years of observations I've had about the company,"" said Chief Executive John Flannery, a GE veteran who took the helm in August with a mandate to revamp the company. Flannery's comments came on a conference call with investors and analysts.
GE said its plan will strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt, building up cash and further shrinking GE Capital. Shareholders will receive 80 percent of the value of GE Healthcare as a tax-free distribution of shares.
GE shares jumped 8.7 percent to $13.86, on track for their best day in three years.
Effective Tuesday, GE was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average, the iconic stock index of which it was a founding member in 1896. 
The company will spin off the profitable healthcare unit over the next 12 to 18 months, and sell its Baker Hughes stake over two to three years.
GE will likely either need to hold an initial public offering of Baker Hughes, organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors, or find an entirely new investor to acquire its holding since the only two strategic buyers of its stake, Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co, would have major antitrust risks in the oilfield services market, analysts said.
In an interview, Flannery declined to rule out selling healthcare or the Baker Hughes stake to strategic buyers, but he said the company intended to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders benefit from future growth.
The decision to divest does not mean GE dislikes the businesses, he said. ""It's quite the opposite. We're trying to get these out directly into our shareholders hands and in an environment where they can grow more quickly."" 
GE pledged to preserve its 48-cent-a-year dividend until the healthcare unit is spun off, partially appeasing investors who have expressed concerns about the company's ability to pay it. [L2N1SU17A]
The moves, which end a year-long strategic review, mirror changes that analysts had sought a year ago. 
GE said its plan to divest $20 billion in assets ""is substantially complete,"" leaving a ""simpler and stronger"" company that it hopes will boost growth, operating profits and shareholder returns.
Major shareholder Trian Fund Management supports GE's plans and believes that the initiatives will create ""substantial value for shareholders,"" it said in a statement. 
The remaining businesses ""share similar technologies and industrial markets, in contrast to limited synergies that exist with GE Healthcare,"" Fitch analyst Eric Ause said in a note.
To view a graphic on GE's market capitalization under past 4 CEOs, click: https://reut.rs/2Mp76e4
BEST AND WORST 
But the changes leave GE with some of its best- and worst-performing units. Aviation has been highly profitable, but power business profit has tumbled as sales of plants and services have slowed, and renewable energy profit margins are less than 5 percent, a result of fierce price competition.
Flannery said in the interview that he expected gas-powered electricity generation to keep rising over the next 30 years. But new power plant sales will be weak ""and frankly we're planning for that as sort of indefinite,"" Flannery said. 
""We're making management actions now premised on we've got to live in that world,"" he said. ""If it changes, great, but don't hope.""
The healthcare unit spinoff follows rival Siemens AG's floating its medical business as a separate company, Siemens Healthineers, in March.
On Monday GE said it agreed to sell its distributed power unit for $3.25 billion to U.S. buyout group Advent. GE also has agreed to shed its transportation unit, which makes railroad locomotives.
GE bought Baker Hughes in 2017 and combined it with its own oil-and-gas equipment and services unit to create a new company in which GE owns 62.5 percent. The unit reported sales of $17.23 billion in 2017.
GE estimated restructuring costs at between $800 million and $1.2 billion, and said it plans to reduce industrial net debt by about $25 billion by 2020 and maintain more than $15 billion of cash on its balance sheet.
The company has foundered in key markets in recent years, and a foray into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in 2008.
GE has since largely divested GE Capital, but lingering liabilities forced it to take a $6.2 billion charge last year, and begin setting aside $15 billion more in reserves against insurance claims.
Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, who ran the company for 16 years, from shortly before the 9/11 attacks to last summer, said in a statement that important elements of GE's history would continue after the latest batch of sales are done.

""GE remains a formidable company,"" he said.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 02:15PM ET</span>",Trump revs up attacks on Harley-Davidson over production move,"By Doina Chiacu and Rajesh Kumar Singh
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) with higher taxes on Tuesday and said the iconic motorcycle maker would suffer from a public backlash if it goes ahead with a plan to move production for European customers overseas.
Trump's attack on the company is another about-face for the president. Early in his administration he had hailed it as a model of American manufacturing and posed with company officials and gleaming Harley bikes on the White House lawn.
""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!"" Trump said.
It was unclear what taxes Trump was referring to, and why the company might have to pay them, since it will maintain production in the United States for U.S. customers. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's tweet.
Harley-Davidson shares fell nearly 1 percent to $41.29, after losing nearly 6 percent on Monday. 
'AN EXCUSE'
The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it will move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast that the trading bloc's tariffs - introduced as a counter to Trump's tariffs on some EU-produced metals - would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year.
Harley-Davidson said it had no comment on the president's tweets. But company spokesman Michael Pflughoeft said it was assessing the potential impact of the production shift on its U.S. facilities.
In his Twitter posts on Tuesday, Trump suggested the famous American brand was using trade tensions over tariffs as an excuse to move production.
""Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse,"" Trump said.
In January, Harley-Davidson said it would close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, due to a sharp drop in U.S. demand for its motorcycles, but said it would consolidate work done there into its plant in York, Pennsylvania.
The company is setting up an assembly plant in Thailand, a move it announced in May 2017, but that would put together bikes only for the growing Southeast Asian market. 
The Thailand plant had no connection with the closure of the Kansas City facility, Harley-Davidson Chief Executive Matt Levatich told Reuters in an interview in February.
The Thailand plant, which will open later this year, would let Harley-Davidson avoid the country's up to 60 percent tariffs on imported motorcycles and help it get tax breaks while exporting to neighboring countries, according to the company. 
Harley's announcement of the Thailand plant came months after Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have lowered import tariffs on the company's bikes in some of the fastest-growing motorcycle markets in Asia.
Besides Thailand, Harley-Davidson has two more assembly plants outside the United States, in Brazil and India. The company has said ramping up production overseas could take at least nine to 18 months. 
As U.S. sales dip, Harley has been aiming to boost overseas sales to 50 percent of annual volume from about 43 percent.
Jaime Katz, a senior analyst at Morningstar Equity Research, said the 'tit-for-tat' retaliatory tariffs might ""temporarily"" hamper some of the company's planned market growth initiatives.
BIKERS FOR TRUMP
Trump first responded angrily to the Harley announcement on Monday, saying he has supported the 115-year-old manufacturer and was surprised by its plans, which he described as waving the ""White Flag."" 
""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!"" Trump said in a post on Twitter on Monday night.
Trump enjoyed the support of a group called ""Bikers for Trump"" in his 2016 presidential campaign and he invited Harley-Davidson representatives to the White House in February 2017 shortly after he took office, greeting them with the words ""Made in America, Harley-Davidson.""
Harley-Davidson is the latest in a line of companies targeted by Trump for various reasons. 
The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) over what he sees as its unfair treatment of the U.S. Postal Service, and he has complained about the high costs of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's replacements for Air Force One aircraft, urging the federal government to cancel the order.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/TORONTO (Reuters) - Steel pipes and tubes used in drilling and transporting crude oil flooded into Canada this spring, a Reuters analysis shows, as U.S. President Donald Trump's steel tariffs forced producers from Asia to Europe to seek new markets.
Canada is a major steel producer in its own right and the biggest supplier to the United States, but the country is swamped by supply from India and South Korea which underscores the global shift in trading patterns following the Trump administration's decision to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imported to the United States.
The spike in imports threatens jobs in the Canadian energy steel-making sector, one of the biggest consumers of the commodity, prompting concerns about plants owned by  Tenaris  SA (MI:TENR), EVRAZ and others, and calls for Ottawa to take action.
(GRAPHIC: Canadian imports of steel pipe for the energy industry, excluding U.S. products - https://reut.rs/2tlYH41)
Non-U.S. imports of drill pipe, casings and line pipe rose 90 percent in April from a year earlier and their total value rose 80 percent to C$183 million ($137.3 million), customs data analyzed by Reuters showed.
""There is a clear and present threat looming over us right now,"" said Neil Rasmussen, president of Alberta-based Bri-Steel Manufacturing. Sales of ""oil country tubular goods"" in Canada are already slow and increased import competition worsens the situation, Rasmussen said.
While steel imports have expanded into Canada for years due to high domestic production costs and global overcapacity, they accelerated after Trump's threats, leading up to the president announcing them on March 1.
The latest surge was driven by an import spike from India and South Korea, the data showed. Tonnage rose more than value, indicating that average prices fell.
Asked about higher shipments to Canada, India's Steel Secretary, Aruna Sharma, said India does not export large quantities of steel overseas.
A flood of cheap imports forced the European Union to launch a safeguard investigation, resulting in a sharp drop in imports through the port of Antwerp, the union's biggest steel-handling port, a spokesperson at the port said.
Selling pipe into the United States has also become harder for Canada with some U.S. customers asking Bri-Steel to delay orders, leaving it to consider layoffs if the situation worsens, Rasmussen said.
The import surge has the potential to close steel plants, said Mark Rowlinson, assistant to the United Steelworkers Canada national director. He referred to a 2015 shutdown at the Tenaris  Prudential  (LON:PRU) plant in Calgary, which the company blamed on a spike in pipe imports. 
GETTING WORSE
A steel industry source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Canadian producers are losing bids to South Korea, Mexico, Romania and China. 
""It's going to get a lot worse.""
Tariffs took effect on March 23, though some U.S. allies including Canada were exempted until May 31. Canadian retaliatory tariffs take effect on July 1.
Canadian authorities can levy special duties on unfairly subsidized steel, or temporarily restrict imports during a sudden surge with a ""safeguard action"". Asked about the potential for safeguards, Canada's Finance Ministry said it is monitoring the situation.
Canada should take action as pipe priced more than 10 percent cheaper floods the market, said Butch Mandel, president of Welded Tube of Canada. The company is realigning its supply chain to sell only Canadian-made products to Canadian customers, Mandel said.
Pipemaker EVRAZ declined to comment on how it has been affected.
Luxembourg-based Tenaris supports Canada's retaliatory tariffs and could boost production if tariffs against U.S. steel cause supply shortages, according to a confidential letter sent last week to Canada's finance department.
""Canadian manufacturers have ample capacity to assure any security of supply concerns,"" said Tenaris Canada vice-president David McHattie, in a letter seen by Reuters.
McHattie declined further comment.
One executive at a Canadian pipeline company, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it is accepting supply quotes from more countries than ever before, allowing it greater flexibility.
But overall, the cost-inflating effect of the trade war is another pressure on Canada's high-cost oil sector, industry officials said.
Steel tariffs are a ""troubling development,"" since steel is used in every part of the (energy) industry, said Nick Schultz, vice-president of pipeline regulation at Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).
Many U.S. manufacturers import Canadian steel to make specialized equipment for Canada's oil industry and are passing along the anticipated Canadian tariff, said Tom Whalen, chief executive of Petroleum Services Association of Canada.
""We have a competition issue in Canada. This is going to make it worse,"" Whalen said.

The dangers raised by the complainants are real and worldwide, and that both parties accepted the science behind global warming, Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said in the ruling.
""(However), the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a District Judge or jury in a public nuisance case,"" Judge Alsup said. 
A Shell spokeswoman said the company regards climate change to be a complex problem, which is not an issue for the courts but requires sound government policy.

BP did not have an immediate comment, while ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil were not available for comment outside regular business hours.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Tuesday said it hired  Lee Enterprises  Inc (N:LEE) to manage its newspaper and digital operations in 30 markets, hoping to boost readership and draw more advertisers as print circulation declines.
Berkshire will continue to own BH Media Group, which has 30 daily newspapers including its hometown Omaha World-Herald in Nebraska and 47 weekly newspapers, and retain editorial control.
Lee expects to earn about $50 million of fees under the initial five-year agreement, comprising $5 million annually plus a share of profits. Strategic decisions will be made jointly.
The agreement takes effect on July 2. Berkshire had invested in Lee in the past. 
""I love our newspapers and am passionate about the vital role they serve in our communities,"" Buffett said in a statement. ""Although the challenges in publishing are clear, I believe we can benefit by joining efforts.""
Lee shares rose 45 cents, or 18.8 percent, to $2.85 in late morning trading. The Davenport, Iowa-based company said it has 46 daily newspapers including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and nearly 300 specialty publications in 21 U.S. states.
While newspapers are only a small part of Berkshire, which bought most of them earlier this decade, the transaction reflects Buffett's disappointment with the industry's decline.
He told shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 5 that only the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and perhaps the Washington Post had found digital models to overcome declines in readership and print ad revenue.
Print circulation fell in 2017 at all but one of Berkshire's daily newspapers, which also include the Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia and Tulsa World in Oklahoma. The number of BH Media employees fell 11 percent last year to 3,719 from 4,194.
Berkshire was a major investor in the former Washington Post Co, whose board Buffett sat on between 1974 and 2011, with a hiatus when he was a director at Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
Tuesday's agreement excludes the Buffalo News in western New York state, a newspaper that Berkshire bought in 1977.

Berkshire owns more than 90 companies in the chemical, energy, food, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and has investments that include Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>",Who is making money from struggling U.S. malls?,"By Richa Naidu and Carl O'Donnell
CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - With its lonely hallways, half-shut food court and out-of-order restrooms, the River Oaks Center mall in suburban Chicago seems like an unlikely place to make money.
But that is exactly what two little-known, family-owned investment firms - Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management - are doing here and across the country.
With about 100 malls from New York to Utah now under their ownership, the two funds have climbed quietly from anonymity to being among the country's top-twenty mall landlords - thanks in large part to an aggressive low-investment business strategy at many of the distressed malls they have acquired over the past five years.
The approach has been aided by a slew of retail bankruptcies, and the fast-changing consumer tastes in favor of e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), offering these two investment firms brick and mortar assets at bargain prices. 
(For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2wv7jcy)
About half the malls Namdar and Mason have acquired are similar to River Oaks: properties with relatively low sales, sometimes in need of redevelopment and typically located in underdeveloped neighborhoods. More recently, the rest of their mall mix has consisted of healthier, but not high-end, properties as the funds have been trying to improve the quality of their assets.
A source with direct knowledge of Mason and Namdar's strategy said the funds invest as little as possible on many of their properties, adding the aim is to hold the assets, not redevelop them.
The approach is not without its detractors, namely mall tenants and some government officials who were hoping to see more investment in their malls once Namdar and Mason took control of the property. But in locations like River Oaks, that investment has not come. 
""There has definitely been a decline in traffic,"" said Vickie Bass, manager of the Ashley Stewart clothing store at the mall. 
In interviews with Reuters, Namdar and Mason said the upkeep was adequate and that they do not flip malls, preferring to hold onto them. On occasion, they have sold their least profitable properties to redevelopers.
""When you own 100 retail properties, of course you're going to have people having complaints... if there are issues, we deal with them,"" Namdar President Igal Namdar said. ""We have a very high retention rate for our tenants, which shows us we are doing a good job."" 
The low rent Namdar and Mason ask for - sometimes only a couple of thousand dollars a month - has helped keep down vacancies at their malls, according to store managers and sources familiar with Mason and Namdar's strategy.
In order to improve the caliber of their tenants and portfolio, Namdar and Mason told Reuters that they have increasingly been buying healthier malls. 
""We now want better quality assets, malls that are occupied, with healthy ratios and diverse tenants,"" Igal Namdar said. 
BUYING CHEAP 
Igal Namdar, 48, and his wife's cousin, Elliot Nassim, 36, the respective founders of Namdar and Mason, said they developed their investment strategy after they started buying malls together in 2012.
Namdar, who got his start in real estate using money from his family's jewelry business, said he clinched his first mall deal that year with Nassim by acquiring Desoto Square (NYSE:SQ) Mall for $24.6 million from Simon Property Group Inc (N:SPG), after it defaulted on a $62 million loan.
A key aspect of Namdar and Mason's strategy is snapping up malls at very low prices. Namdar and Mason told Reuters they have spent an average of $15 million to $20 million to acquire retail properties in the past three years, a fraction of what many of the malls cost to develop.
According to real estate data firm Trepp, Namdar and Mason bought 22 properties that were being sold in bankruptcy auctions between the start of 2015 and the end of 2017, paying an average of $5.3 million for each mall. This reflects a 92 percent discount to the value of the malls when they secured their loans, according to Reuters calculations.
Namdar and Mason typically spend 20 to 50 cents per square foot on maintenance. This compares to an average of about 60 cents per square foot that U.S. mall owners spent on mall upkeep in the first quarter of 2018 among malls that reported square feet for the period, according to National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries.
Namdar and Mason have spent so little on the malls they have acquired, they often yield a 10 to 16 percent capitalization rate, a gauge of the investment's rate of return, according to real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield's head of capital markets Mark Gilbert. 
This tops last year's average U.S. mall capitalization rate of 5.4 percent, and even the 9 percent rate mall owners enjoyed on average in their 1990s heyday, according to real estate research firm GreenStreet.
But Mason and Namdar's high-return strategy comes at the risk of friction with local officials, retailers and shoppers.

""Over time, you do become what you're perceived. I think that in many respects if they don't define what they're going to do with these malls in general, then they may get defined by the bad ones,"" Gilbert said.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Ad infinitum? Mad Men seek new pitch for digital age,"By Kate Holton
CANNES, France (Reuters) - Paid to have their finger on the consumer's pulse, the Mad Men of advertising are under mounting pressure from clients to adapt to a fast-changing digital age where simply shifting marketing dollars online from old media no longer cuts it as a strategy. 
Talk at the global industry's annual gathering in Cannes was dominated by complaints that owners of ad agencies, including the biggest WPP (LON:WPP), are no longer set up to help brands reach consumers in an online world of mass but fragmented content. 
With tensions rising, many brands are creating their own digital ads in-house and placing them directly on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Many more are demanding that agencies rebuild around the client rather than making campaigns in individual agencies to be placed on specific parts of the market - such as mobile phones, social media, billboards, radio, TV and more. 
Tencent's Seng Yee Lau, who oversees advertising on China's biggest social media platform, said brands and ad agencies needed to fundamentally restructure after the internet became the largest platform for ads, ahead of TV. 
""The reason why marketing is no longer seen as the engine for growth is because we have not innovated ourselves,"" he told Reuters. ""The people the brands are trying to address have formed themselves into a new digital civilization."" 
Changes at  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), which spent $9 billion on marketing last year, reflect the tension. 
It says it will still use agencies to make big creative TV ads and to advise and buy media inventory, but it is increasingly creating content in-house to keep costs down.
""I'm a huge supporter of advertising agencies but what I need is something fit for purpose for this new world,"" said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer for Unilever which owns brands including Dove, Magnum and Persil. 
""Not every bit of advertising needs to be epic."" 
Unilever typically works with a dozen agencies for one brand. As each of those agencies runs its own P&L, it receives conflicting advice and ultimately conflicting ad messages. 
WPP, which works with Unilever, has over 400 agencies. Unilever makes and sells around 400 brands. 
JOINED-UP THINKING
Unilever is running a trial with four brands where agencies have had to create an integrated offering, a move designed to help it reach consumers who now use media, content and e-commerce in vastly different ways from just a few years ago. 
""The technology itself isn't the challenge,"" Weed said. ""The thing that is much harder to predict is the consumer behavior change that the technology drives.""
Reflecting the huge amount of flux in the industry, different brands are taking different approaches. Mars, owner of M&M's, Uncle Ben's and Pedigree, said it had done a few small in-house trials but was instead saving costs by taking crowd sourced video ads - provided, for example, by freelancers and production companies - from agency BBDO, owned by Omnicom.
""My mantra is working with our partners and encouraging them to disrupt themselves,"" marketing boss Andrew Clarke told Reuters, about crowd-sourced ads ""at a fraction of the price but within the BBDO house and with their stamp of quality"".
That is a reference to companies, including Mars, that pulled ads from YouTube last year after they found them placed next to extremist content. 
P&G, the world's largest advertiser for brands such as Olay, Gillette and Pampers, has perhaps gone the furthest by asking talent from across WPP and other agencies owned by rivals Omnicom and Publicis to form one team to provide one offering.
The changing dynamics mean the major holding companies - which also include IPG, Dentsu and Havas - are slowly losing their once vice-like grip on a client's ad spend.
New competitors Accenture and Deloitte are helping that happen, using existing consultancy relationships with C-suite executives to offer to review their spending and cut out unnecessary expense. 
Accenture Interactive's Joy Bhattacharya, on a boat that was moored alongside one from rival PwC, said the work of a consultant was to break down silos in major companies to improve operations. Adding in marketing could help the overall result. 
""My desire is to see how we can join it all up because that's where a lot of transformation changes fail,"" he said.
CONSTANT CHANGE
On top of the changing dynamics, advertising is also grappling with Europe's new GDPR law which regulates the use of personal data, threatening ad agencies and networks that use such information to send targeted ads to individual users. 
One of those in Cannes at the sharp end of the change is Jonathan Nelson, the digital boss of the world's second biggest holding company Omnicom. He accepts that his agencies from BBDO Worldwide to TBWA may lose bits of work they once provided. 
In the long term, however, he argues brands need agencies more than ever to create ads that cut through the chaos and grab the attention of consumers, whether they are on social networks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Spotify, gardening blogs or watching TV at home.
""The world isn't getting less complex, it's more,"" he said. ""So how do you stitch that together?"" 
The scale of the change can be most clearly felt at WPP, the world's biggest ad company that employs 200,000 people through agencies such as JWT and Ogilvy & Mather to support clients including Ford, Unilever, P&G and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD). 
Mark Read, running the British firm after the resignation of founder Martin Sorrell, said radical change was needed after a sharp slowdown in client spend led to profit warnings in 2017. 
""Every industry in the world is being disrupted,"" he told Reuters on the seafront terrace of a grand hotel in Cannes. ""To some extent knowing how to do it really well in the old world is not always an advantage for how to do it in the new."" 
The one consensus in Cannes was that advertising and marketing, described by its leaders as a $1 trillion industry, is going through the biggest upheaval in decades.
While that jeopardizes jobs on New York's Madison Avenue, in London's Soho and other corners of the world, it also threatens a much wider ecosystem where advertising not only funds free content and services online, but drives economic growth too. 
Michael Roth, boss of IPG, agreed with Omnicom's Nelson that ad execs are needed in a rapidly changing world to chart the new terrain. He says IPG was outperforming peers. But from an investor point of view he conceded they could all do better.
The share prices of the top four holding companies - WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and IPG - are all down in the last 12 months, with WPP falling almost 30 percent. 
""I have a slide that says 'we're the new disruptors in the industry, the advertising industry is doomed',"" he told Reuters. ""That was the headline of the Wall Street Journal 25 years ago.
""There are a lot of people chasing the same amount of revenue, so that is an issue. We have to be ahead of the game.""

In a staff memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday, the bank's chief operating officer Tom Montag said Sanaz Zaimi, head of Global Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) Sales, would assume the additional role of country executive for France and relocate to the French capital during 2019.
The move is one of the most senior Brexit staff redeployments to date by a major bank, and reflects a renewed sense of action among institutions keen to protect their businesses from a possible Brexit shock.
International banks which built up London operations over the past few years are now scrambling to beef up EU outposts to overcome the loss of passporting rights which enable them to offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states with just one local license.
U.S. banks have said London would almost certainly remain their primary hub in Europe irrespective of Brexit, citing a broader pool of talent, a more suitable legal and regulatory framework and an Anglo-Saxon workplace culture as factors giving the British capital an edge.
But they have also said relocation and hiring decisions were subject to change, depending on the shape of any financial services deal between Britain and Brussels.
In preparation, Bank of America is merging its London-based subsidiary with its Dublin-based Irish entity, which will become its main EU base. 
It has already said it would expand its investment banking activities in Paris and transfer some of its London-based back office operations to Dublin, ahead of Brexit. 
Reuters earlier reported that up to 400 jobs in Bank of America's markets, trading, sales and fixed income teams would move from London to the EU in a first wave of transfers next year, citing two sources familiar with the bank's Brexit plans.
Zaimi will be joined by Vanessa Holtz, who is currently head of global G10 foreign exchange trading and co-head of EMEA G10 FX trading. She will also become head of European Union FICC trading. Othmane Kabbaj, head of EMEA emerging markets FICC sales, will assume the additional role of head of EU FICC sales, the memo said.

Holtz and Kabbaj will also relocate from London to the bank's new Paris offices next year, Montag said, adding that further EU leadership appointments would be announced in due course.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",JP Morgan consults on including Gulf states in key bond index,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan has started a consultation on including Gulf states in its widely tracked emerging market government bond indexes, although a number of issues remain sticking points.
JP Morgan's EMBI bond index is a key performance benchmark for emerging market investors. Inclusion in the index can encourage hundreds of billions of dollars of buying of that country's bonds, lowering its borrowing costs.
Slides produced as part of the bank's annual index ""governance consultation"" first looked at various metrics for Gulf states, whose relatively high incomes don't always fit the standard definition of an ""emerging"" market.
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar - have issued a quarter of all new debt sold by emerging markets in each of the last three years. They now account for 14 percent of total EM debt stock.
A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the likelihood of Gulf countries getting the green light in the next update of the index, which normally gets announced around September.
A source at the bank told Reuters that its ""indices work to strict rules of eligibility and this rumored scenario with GCC countries (gaining inclusion) may never come to pass"". 
The presentation showed how GCC countries are too high on the World Bank High Income classification (IIC) index to meet normal emerging market index eligibility. 
However, there could be other ways to look at it, such as purchasing power parity ratios that the IMF and OECD use to compare different countries' wealth. That would class GCC countries firmly as emerging markets. 
Analysts and investors were beginning to run the numbers on what inclusion would mean in terms of bond buying.
According to JP Morgan's estimates, about $360 billion track its hard-currency emerging market debt indexes. About $150 billion of debt from GCC may get added with an expected weight of 12.33 percent. A phase-in could happen at 2 percent a month for six months.
""This could lead to passive inflows of over $45 billion, which will be about 30 percent of total amount outstanding of the bonds to be added,"" said Abhishek Kumar, the managing director for emerging markets debt and fixed income beta at State Street Global Advisers.
Dino Kronfol, chief investment officer for global sukuk and MENA fixed-income strategies at Franklin Templeton said it would be a ""tremendous development and very positive for the region, particularly efforts to develop regional capital markets.""
Assessing the situation in China, the JP Morgan consultation acknowledged that significant progress had been made in opening the country's bond markets to foreign investors since 2016. 
""We continue to observe key action items to determine GBI-EM Global Diversified eligibility,"" JP Morgan wrote in the presentation slides, referring to the bank's local sovereign debt benchmark. 
Adding only the more readily traded or ""liquid"" Chinese government bonds could result in an estimated weight of 7 percent in the bank's flagship GBI-EM Global Diversified index. 
China has $800 billion of bonds represented in the GBI-EM Broad index, but the replicability of these bonds remained unclear, JP Morgan added. 

Just over $230 billion of assets under management are benchmarked against its local debt indexes, of which $211 billion are benchmarked again the GBI-EM Global Diversified index, the bank said.

1458,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Harley-Davidson's decision to shift some manufacturing out of the US confirms the worst fears about Trump's trade battles,"Iconic US motorcycle company  Harley-Davidson announced Monday that it was moving more of its production outside of the US in response to new tariffs, showing the reality of how President Donald Trump's trade fights can backfire.
Harley-Davidson said the EU's  new tariffs on US-made motorcycles would  drive up costs and force the company to shift a sizable portion to its production outside of the US to avoid the tariff.
The company said the  EU's tariff increase — to 31%, from the current 6% — would increase the cost of every motorcycle shipped from the US to Europe by $2,200.
""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said  in a regulatory filing. ""Harley-Davidson expects ramping-up production in international plants will require incremental investment and could take at least nine to 18 months to be fully complete.""
The EU implemented tariffs on just over $3 billion worth of US goods in response to Trump's decision to hit steel and aluminum imports with tariffs. In addition to four US-based manufacturing facilities,  Harley operates plants in Australia, India, Brazil, and Thailand.
 Trump fired back at the company in a series of tweets across Monday and Tuesday, threatening retaliation if Harley went through with the move.
""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never!"" Trump  tweeted Tuesday. ""Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!""
While the back-and-forth between the president and the legendary company appears to be heating up, Harley's move is also an example of what economists say will be a significant long-term problem with the tariffs and represents a black eye for Trump's arguments in favor of the measures.
""For Harley to be forced to move production out of the country because of the tariffs is very damaging to Trump’s repeated claim that his trade, tax and regulatory policies will get companies to boost their US investments and create good manufacturing jobs,"" Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider.
Tariffs increase costs for businesses. And many of Trump's tariffs focus on intermediary goods, or parts, that are then incorporated into finished products. That increases the costs for companies to bring the parts they need into the US to complete their products.
In turn, it also incentivizes firms to move their production abroad since other countries may have lower tariffs — or no tariffs — on the same intermediate product.
Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Yang Liang, a graduate associate at the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs, highlighted the possibility that companies will abandon the US in a recent policy paper.
""Beyond the immediate damage to American competitiveness, trade restrictions push high-technology firms to locate elsewhere in the future,"" the researchers wrote. ""Tariffs can diminish trade flows, but ideas are easily relocated.""
Additionally, retaliatory tariffs from the EU, Canada, Mexico, and more make it expensive to get finished goods into those markets. By shifting production closer to the point of sale, businesses can avoid the increased cost to sell in Europe or other countries with restrictions.
Alden said that given those two compelling economic cases, Harley-Davidson could be just the start of a series of manufacturing relocations outside the US.
""I think this is only the beginning. Most global trade is still in manufacturing, and the combination of the steel and aluminum tariffs, the coming China tariffs, and the various retaliatory actions are going to increase costs for many manufacturers,"" Alden said. ""I expect many other companies will be forced reluctantly to move production as Harley has done in order to maintain their viability.""
In addition to being a possible economic harbinger, the loss of Harley-Davidson's production also comes as a symbolic blow to Trump. The president hosted Harley executive at the White House in 2017 and has repeatedly praised the company as a strong homegrown product.
""It is highly visible evidence that even an icon of American manufacturing can be turned against Trump through targeted retaliation,"" Benn Steil, senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider."

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>",Toyota gives Corolla a sporty makeover to draw young drivers in aging Japan,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has given the Corolla, one of the world's best-selling cars, a major makeover and launched it in Japan on Tuesday in hopes that a sporty silhouette and new interactive functions will draw in younger buyers. 
While ubiquitous among first-time drivers and university students in North America, Corolla's top market that accounts for about a third of its global sales, the model has become known as a car for the elderly at home where the average age of its owners is around 70 - an image Toyota wants to change.
""We're grateful that our older customers have remained loyal to the Corolla,"" said Yoshiki Konishi, chief engineer of the Corolla Sport, the newest model which next goes on sale in North America in the coming months and Europe in 2019. 
""But we want the Corolla to resonate more with younger drivers ... we want to target people in their 20s and 30s.""
To spruce up the image of its most iconic model, Toyota has led the Corolla's rollout with the hatchback Sport version rather than the traditional sedan.
For Japan, the Corolla Sport comes fitted with Toyota's data communication module which collects driving data to provide cloud-based, real-time navigation and technical support, while also monitoring vehicle health to give maintenance updates. 
Corolla and a revamped domestic Crown sedan model, also launched on Tuesday, will be Toyota's first mass-market cars to offer such advanced technological functions that were previously available exclusively in models from its high-end Lexus brand. Other automakers offer similar functions.
""By adding connected capabilities to a model known for being popular among older drivers, Toyota is trying to attract younger people to the Corolla, and widen its customer base (at home), said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama.
""By doing so, it is betting that the next car trend may not be based on vehicle segment or model, but perhaps on applications, or functions.""
But attracting younger drivers is tough in general in fast-graying Japan, where the number of driving license holders aged under 30 dropped 22 percent in the past decade while for those aged 65 and above it jumped 64 percent, official data shows.
The Corolla Sport's revamped image and connected functions had limited appeal for Yuhei Fujita, a 27-year-old who works for a tech company in Tokyo and does not own a car.
""Most cars have decent navigation systems, and if I were to buy a car I'd be happy to be able to connect my smartphone to it,"" Fujita said.
""The Corolla has a strong image as being a family car, so I'm not sure why Toyota wants to market it toward younger people now."" 
Toyota declined to give demographic targets for the newest member of the Corolla family, which has sold 46 million units across more than 150 countries since its launch in 1966.
But Konishi acknowledged the reliability of the Corolla would likely continue to draw in mature drivers.

""I'm in my 50s, and I'm planning to buy one.""

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) said it is not considering moving production out of Britain because of Brexit, although the carmaker has cut its dependence on its Oxford car plant by quietly expanding a new Dutch assembly site for its Mini brand.
By building up a second export base for its Mini brand outside of Britain, BMW can mitigate any damage caused by a possible hard exit from the European Union's single market. 
Asked whether the German carmaker was actively considering moving production out of Britain due to uncertainty over future trade relationships, BMW executive Ian Robertson said: ""No we're not."" 
""We are committed to our operations in the UK, our workforce here,"" the German carmaker's special representative for Britain said at a conference on Tuesday.
Comments published in the Financial Times from another BMW executive on Monday suggested that BMW would close its British factories which make Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) cars if Brexit leads to serious supply chain disruption.
Robertson said those comments were taken out of context and referred to supply chain disruption resulting in delays to production at factories.
Asked about the impact of Brexit uncertainty on any new production in Britain, Robertson said there were no investment choices to be made on that front. 
""In our cycle we are in an enviable place because we took a lot of decisions three and a half years ago and as a result we don't need to make any decisions right now,"" he said on the sidelines of a conference in London.
Britain's main car lobby group said on Tuesday that a lack of clarity on Brexit had halved new investment in the industry and urged Prime Minister Theresa May to keep the world's fifth largest economy in the EU's customs union.
BMW has spent the past four years quietly stepping up production capacity at a new European export hub for the Mini with Dutch contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar, reducing its dependence on a plant in Oxford, central England.
At VDL Nedcar staffing levels have jumped to about 7,200 today, from around 4,500 last year and 1,450 in 2014, VDL said. VDL declined to give a current figure for vehicle production, but said capacity has risen beyond 170,000 vehicles last year, from 89,000 vehicles in 2016.
""The numbers at VDL Nedcar have nothing to do with the current Brexit discussions,"" BMW said. 
By contrast staffing levels at BMW's British plant have remained relatively stable during the same period, with just over 4,500 people working on building Minis in Oxford. 
The plant in Oxford made about 60 percent of the 378,486 Mini's produced last year. 

BMW said VDL's staffing levels have jumped after it added the assembly of BMW's popular X1 model to the Dutch production line in August last year, in addition to building the Mini hatch, Mini plug-in hybrid and Mini convertible at the plant in the southern Dutch town of Born.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in June likely rose 2.5 percent from the same month in 2017 as consumers continued to prefer expensive pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers over passenger cars although discounts on new vehicles remain high, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Tuesday.
But the positive sales month for major automakers was overshadowed by trade war concerns.
""Tariff threats remain at center stage,"" LMC head of global vehicle forecasts Jeff Schuster said in a statement. ""A trade war involving vehicles would be devastating to sales volume in the United States and other key markets.""
Last week Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) cut its 2018 profit forecast, saying import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz sales. 
New vehicle prices remained high during June. The average transaction for the first half of 2018 should hit $32,221, surpassing the previous record of $31,397 in 2017, the consultancies said.
June will be the second consecutive month of rising sales. Despite those gains, the first half of the year should be the weakest for the U.S. auto industry since 2014.
June U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.508 million units, up from 1.472 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 14 selling days of June. Automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), will release June U.S. sales results on July 3.
No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) will issue its first quarterly sales report after saying in April it would stop reporting monthly U.S. sales. 
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million units after hitting a record high in 2016.
Sales are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
LMC maintained its full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales forecast of 17.1 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales for June will be 16.9 million vehicles, up more than 1 percent from 16.7 million units in June 2017, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, excluding lower-margin fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to increase by more than 2 percent in June.

Through the first six months of the year consumer discounts hit $3,892, up $118 from the same period in 2017.

LONDON (LPC) - Blackstone (N:BX) has launched a $5.5 billion bridge loan to support the pending bond issuance for its acquisition of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ (TO:TRI) Financial and Risk division (F&R), which is expected to complete later this year.
The $5.5 billion bridge loan is separate from an US$8bn equivalent term loan B portion of Blackstone's $13.5 billion loan and bond financing, which is also being shown to large institutional investors, Thomson Reuters LPC reported on Monday. 
The financing package supports Blackstone's $20 billion acquisition of a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters' F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR and is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis. 
The bridge loan includes a $3 billion, 7.5 year senior secured loan, which is split between $2 billion and $1 billion-equivalent euros, and an eight-year, $2.5 billion unsecured loan, which is split between $1.8 billion and $700 million-equivalent.
The structure mirrors the expected sizes of the bond tranches.
The senior secured tranche pays a margin of 400bp and the unsecured tranche has a margin of 625bp.
A 50bp commitment fee is included for tickets of at least $150 million on the secured tranche and 25bp is payable for all other ticket sizes.
The unsecured tranche has a 75bp commitment fee for tickets of at least $50 million and 50bp for all other commitments.

1469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Trump Says Harley Move Abroad Would Be ‘Beginning of the End’,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump accused Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). of using new tariffs on trade as cover for an existing plan to shift some production abroad and threatened the motorcycle manufacturer with a ""big tax"" on bikes imported to the U.S. if it relocates some plants overseas.
The company said in a government filing Monday that it may locate some production outside the U.S. in response to European retaliation for the president’s tariffs on imported metals.
But Trump took issue with that on Tuesday.
June 26, 2018
""Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it,"" Trump said Tuesday in a Twitter posting.
The president followed up by warning the company that goods produced overseas and imported back into the U.S. could be taxed. “Harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Trump said on Twitter Tuesday.
June 26, 2018 June 26, 2018
Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a ""Plan B"" that Harley employed after the U.S. abandoned the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year. He’d said they didn’t relish the investment, which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market.
The early-morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker, after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump’s penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.
“To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,” the company said.
On Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""
“I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!”
In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years trough bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump’s “trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.”
“The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,” Sanders told reporters at the White House.
Jack Daniel’s Feels Pinch
Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel’s.
Brown-Forman Corp., which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25 percent tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel’s, would amount to about a 10 percent increase for consumers.
Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that “we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.”
Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.
Harley shares fell 6 percent, the biggest drop in almost five months, to close at $41.57. The stock is down 18 percent this year.
The EU’s levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump’s trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.
Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as “a true American icon” and “one of the greats.”
Ryan Weighs In
“Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,” Trump said at the time. “I think you’re going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there’s a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren’t having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.”
Harley-Davidson’s headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump’s move to impose tariffs, said the company’s announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president’s trade policy.
“This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,” AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. “The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.”

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Audi partners with Israel's autonomous vehicle simulation startup Cognata,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - German carmaker  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG) has partnered with autonomous vehicle simulation platform provider Cognata Ltd to speed up the development of autonomous vehicles, the Israel-based startup said on Tuesday.
Cognata said its simulation platform virtually recreates real-world cities, provides a range of testing scenarios, including traffic models that simulate realistic conditions, prior to physical roadway tests of autonomous vehicles.
Audi, through its self driving car unit Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH (AID), is the first major carmaker to sign a multi-year partnership on Cognata's platform, which will help it reduce the time to get its autonomous cars to market.
""At AID, we are convinced that simulation is a key tool to increase our development speed and a necessary one for the validation of our product and for proving it is safe,"" AID Chief Technology Officer Alex Haag said.
""After exploring various solutions, we decided that partnering with Cognata is the fastest way to reach these goals,"" Haag added.
A slew of car and technology companies from U.S. No.1 automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) to Uber [UBER.UL] and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo are investing in testing autonomous capabilities and looking to launch the technology for commercial use soon. 
""Simulation technology can help greatly reduce autonomous vehicle testing costs for carmakers,"" Cognata Chief Executive Officer Danny Atsmon told Reuters.
The AID-Cognata deal comes at a time when Israel's defense technology, which has helped its military drive tanks, guide and intercept missiles, and keep its computer systems secure, is being redeployed in the development of driverless cars.
Israeli auto tech startups raised $814 million last year, only slightly behind the $1.2 billion raised by U.S. firms. (https://reut.rs/2Iqe3cg)
U.S. chipmaker Intel (O:INTC), German auto supplier Continental (DE:CONG), Samsung (KS:005930),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and GM (N:GM) are among companies that have bought startups or are setting up their own development centers in Israel.
Cognata, which competes with firms including Redwood City, California-based Metamoto, had raised a total of $5 million as of the last funding round in 2017. 

The startup's investors include Maniv Mobility - a car technology fund backed by Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) and French auto parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) - planemaker Airbus' venture capital fund Airbus Ventures and Tel-Aviv based early-stage venture capital firm Emerge.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares made a modest bounce on Tuesday, recovering slightly after trade tensions sent stock markets into a spiral as investors shed risky assets. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.3 percent by 0837 GMT, but was far from making up all the previous session's 2 percent losses. The index hovered near its lowest level since mid-April. 
Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI), which has been the most sensitive to trade tensions, managed a 0.4 percent gain. 
The sectors worst hit by the trade-related sell-off were Tuesday's strongest gainers, with basic resources (SXPP), banks and oil stocks (SXEP) leading the way, while tech stocks (SX8P) also recovered. 
Autos (SXAP), a sector in the firing line of higher tariffs, managed a 0.5 percent gain having hit a fresh 9 1/2 month low on Monday, with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) leading Italy's FTSE MIB. 
Multinational consumer firms LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Richemont and Swatch all rose too. 
Concerns over trade have gripped global markets over the past weeks, wiping $1.5 trillion off the MSCI All-Country World since June 12. 
Trade disputes and slower economic growth have hit European stocks hard, with the STOXX 600 down 3 percent year-to-date and euro zone stocks (STOXXE) down 2.4 percent.
Chris Hiorns, senior fund manager at EdenTree, said he thought European stocks would perform more robustly ""if we could really see growth come through and become self-enforcing, a virtuous circle of growth driving higher demand.""
But, he added: ""If we are looking for triggers then what we'd want is for Trump to stop his trade war with China.""
On the stock level, merger and acquisition news drove the biggest movers. 
British satellite firm  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) fell 6.3 percent, the worst on the STOXX 600, after France's Eutelsat (PA:ETL) said it did not intend to make an offer for the firm, having said on Monday it was considering a possible bid. 
Eutelsat shares rose 2.9 percent.
Bid speculation meanwhile boosted French payments processor  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) 4.2 percent after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the firm was drawing preliminary interest from several private equity firms.
In results-driven moves, the food and biopharma testing firm Eurofins (PA:EUFI) jumped 5.4 percent after saying it was raising its revenue target for the year, having received antitrust clearance for its acquisition of U.S. food company Covance.
Austrian paper pulp maker Andritz (VI:ANDR) rose 3.1 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to a ""buy"", a day after the firm clinched a deal to buy U.S. company Xerium Technologies.
Ambu (CO:AMBUb) shares fell back 5.2 percent, having risen as much as 9 percent on Monday after an ""overweight"" rating from JP Morgan. 
While investors were concerned about the potential deepening of a trade spat which has shifted from a bilateral U.S.-China dispute to one involving more regions, including Europe, some analysts said the economic impact would ultimately be limited. 

""Trade negotiations have also been distracting attention from decent economic fundamentals, especially in the U.S., and strong corporate earnings growth,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management.

LONDON (Reuters) - Modest gains from Europe's main bourses relieved nervy investors on Tuesday, after the latest escalation in an increasingly global trade storm pummeled Wall Street and sent China into 'bear' market territory.
A 0.3 percent rise from the FTSE in London and 0.4 percent gains from Frankfurt and Paris was a welcome sight after another bumpy Asian session had extended a sell-off that has now wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. [.T] (SS)
China's yuan had slumped to a near six-month low against the dollar, while 0.5-0.8 percent fall on big share markets (SS) left them down 20 percent from their January peaks, a threshold that defines a 'bear' market.

The dollar hovered near a 12-day low against a six-strong group of other top world currencies having drifted down versus the euro, yen and pound despite a modest uptick in U.S. bond yields. [FRX/]
""The sell off in risk assets has eased, but it is certainly not the last storm we are likely to see coming from that direction,"" said Societe Generale's global macro strategist Kit Juckes.
The tense atmosphere also kept metals on the defensive as financial markets worried about the wider global economic fallout of the U.S. administration's ""America First' agenda.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had ramped up the rhetoric again on Monday saying on Twitter that restrictions on investing in U.S. tech firms would apply ""to all countries that are trying to steal our technology."" 
Wall Street had tumbled, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their steepest losses in more than two months, and the Dow Jones closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016. (N)
The so-called FAANG stocks, which have led momentum in U.S. stocks, were hammered too after having hit record intraday highs last week. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dropped 2.7 percent, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) NFLX) slid 6.5 percent, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost 2.6 percent.
Asia then followed albeit in smaller scale. Tech-heavy indexes such as South Korea's KOSPI and Taiwan's weighted index fell 0.45 percent and 0.55 percent, respectively. 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was down 1.8 percent, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc lost 1 percent and Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings shed 0.3 percent.
""Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington's bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy,"" wrote Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
""It's turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections (in November)."" 
CARS WARS
Another sign of the dust gradually settling in Europe was the first rise in European car shares in eight days. Carmakers are another likely target of U.S President Donald Trump's tariff plans.
The euro dipped back having reached a near two-week high of $1.1722 while the dollar was beginning to find some traction again against the yen. It was last at 109.67, having fallen to a two-week low of 109.365 yen. The yen often attracts safe-haven bids in times of political tension and market turmoil.
Brent crude oil futures were up 0.15 percent at $74.83 on uncertainty over Libya's capacity to deliver on exports commitments. Brent futures had fallen 1 percent overnight as receding investor risk appetite weighed on commodities. [O/R]
Oil prices were capped after OPEC and its allies on Friday agreed to increase global supplies, albeit modestly.

Trade concerns kept copper on the London Metal Exchange near a 2-1/2-month low of $6,702.5 per tonne brushed on Monday. Spot gold shed 0.1 percent to $1,263.62 an ounce.

When asked by a reporter at a conference whether the German car manufacturer was ""actively considering"" moving production out of Britain due to uncertainty over future trade relationships, Ian Robertson said: ""No we're not."" 
""We are committed to our operations in the UK, our workforce here,"" he added. 
Comments published in the Financial Times by a BMW executive on Monday suggested that BMW would close its British factories which make Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) cars if Brexit leads to serious supply chain disruption.

Robertson said those comments were taken out of context and referred to supply chain disruption resulting in delays to production at factories.

Sainsbury's sales were down 0.2 percent in the 12 weeks to June 17 and its market share fell 0.4 percentage points to 15.6 percent, researcher Kantar Worldpanel said.
Shares in the group, which in April agreed to buy No. 3 player Asda for 7.3 billion pounds ($9.7 billion), were down 1.8 percent at 0814 GMT.
Sainsbury's is due to publish a first quarter trading update on July 4.
In contrast, sales at Asda, the British arm of Walmart (N:WMT), rose 1.8 percent. They were up 1.4 percent at market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and up 1.9 percent at No. 4 Morrisons (L:MRW).
However, all three continued to lose market share to discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl.
Aldi's sales rose 8.2 percent and Lidl's were up 10.0 percent, giving market shares of 7.4 percent and 5.4 percent respectively.
Overall, UK grocery sales rose 2.1 percent in the period, reflecting strong sales of spirits, soft drinks and hay fever remedies.
Kantar Worldpanel said grocery inflation was 1.9 percent, with prices rising fastest in markets such as butter, colas and canned fish.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",China's regional jet gold rush hits regulatory turbulence,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regional jet market is struggling to get off the ground as Beijing slows approvals for new airlines, industry executives say, dashing hopes that recent policy changes would drive aircraft sales. 
Foreign companies such as  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), Embraer SA (A:EMBR3) and ATR had cheered a 2016 policy that required passenger carriers to operate at least 25 city-hopper jets before graduating to bigger aircraft.
It appeared to all but assure sales of such small planes in the world's fastest-growing aircraft market, currently dominated by wide-body jets, as the regulator tried to boost flights into China's smaller cities.
But there is a problem, executives say: the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has only approved two new airlines since the ""Rule 96"" policy went into effect. ""The truth is that almost two years has passed and I have not succeeded in one single deal,"" said one executive from a Chinese aircraft lessor speaking on condition of anonymity, who added that he had met with numerous start-ups to promote regional aircraft.
The executives added that although the slowdown was probably well meaning, caused by regulators' concerns over safety and quality, it meant that there was a queue of at least six Chinese airlines waiting for approval. 
The policy had stoked optimism among regional aircraft makers, as Chinese airlines have for years mostly focused on growing their fleets of Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (NYSE:BA)  Out of 3,311 commercial aircraft flying in China at the end of March, just 5 percent were regional jets, the CAAC said in April. By comparison, regional jets in 2016 took up 30.6 percent of the 7,039-strong fleet of aircraft in the United States, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration.  ""The intention is that (the regulators) want to push, but they have enhanced the entry barriers so they have very high standards for the investors,"" said Wang Qi, chief China representative for French turboprop manufacturer ATR, which is renewing its Chinese certification.  Chinese airlines in general have a good safety record. The CAAC did not respond to requests for comment.  PATIENCE AND FRUSTRATION For many, Rule 96 underlined Beijing's intentions to improve regional air transport. The country's 13th five-year plan for 2016-2020 included 500 new airports. But only Tianjiao Airlines in Inner Mongolia and  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) subsidiary Beijing Airlines, which converted from a private charter operator to a passenger airline, were approved last year.  An executive at Tianju Airlines, which is waiting for the green light to start carrier operations from central China's Shaanxi province, said regulators grew more cautious.  But he said the airline hopes to fly next year, after four years of preparations and at least one change to its proposal to adjust to CAAC policies.  ""We currently fulfill all conditions,"" said the executive, who only gave his surname as Li because he was not authorized to speak to the media. AirAsia Group (KL:AIRA), which is working with local partners to establish a low-cost carrier in China, has looked at options like buying an existing air operator's certification to speed things up, according to two sources familiar with their plans.  The company, which last year signed a memorandum of understanding with China Everbright Group and the Henan government, declined to comment.  OPTIMISM  The only aircraft that meet Rule 96's seat limits of 100 or less and are certified to be sold in China are Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd's [CMAFC.UL] ARJ-21, AVIC Aircraft's (SZ:000768) MA60 turboprop and Bombardier's Q400 and CRJ 900 models. Bombardier and Embraer said they remained optimistic about their prospects in China.  ""The situation under Rule 96 continues to evolve,"" Bombardier Commercial Aircraft's President Fred Cromer said in an interview with Reuters at the company's Montreal-area factory in the Canadian province of Quebec last week.  ""The fact that we have a plane that's well known by the authorities there and an operator that operates quite a few works in our favor,"" he said in reference to Bombardier CRJ 900 operator China Express.  Embraer said in an e-mail that it expects its E175 jet to obtain CAAC certification by September.  But Corrine Png, chief executive of transport consultancy Crucial Perspective, said Chinese airlines were still more inclined to buy larger jets to meet surging travel demand amid a shortage of landing slots and pilots.  ""It would be costly to maintain a small number of regional jets in China which may not be economically efficient from the Chinese airlines standpoint,"" she said. HOMEGROWN COMPETITION Industry insiders are also concerned that Beijing may be promoting China's domestically produced aircraft over more advanced models.  COMAC put the ARJ-21 regional jet into service in 2016 and has delivered just five so far. But it has orders for 450 planes, dwarfing the numbers for Bombardier and Embraer's in China. Tianju Airlines told Reuters it had considered Airbus' A320 and Embraer E190 jets but decided to buy the ARJ-21.  ""We think it's the most suitable model for us,"" said Li, who declined to comment further.  ATR's Wang said the turboprop maker planned to look beyond regional jets and consider general aviation, which Beijing has also pledged to support with infrastructure investment.  
Any company can buy an aircraft and begin operating it for charters, for instance. That means ATR could reconfigure its 42-seat model into a 30-seat offering for such businesses, he said. ""That category has very low barriers and there are potential investors for ATR,"" he said.

1490,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","‘Outright Bear’ Ahead for Emerging Markets, Morgan Stanley Says","(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market economies witnessing an equity selloff have more than just the U.S.-China tension to blame, said Jonathan Garner, Morgan Stanley’s chief Asia and emerging markets strategist.
There’s also accelerated tightening in the U.S., a rollover in global growth outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, as well as risks around oil-price strength, the Hong Kong-based Garner told Bloomberg Television.
“This is a dangerous market,” Garner said. “We now think we’re heading to an outright bear market.”
The diverse troubles convinced  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists to lower their 12-month target for the MSCI emerging-markets gauge to 1,000 from 1,160. Garner noted that the team has been worried since the end of 2017 about how a softening in equities would play out in emerging markets.
Movement in interest rates on the back of Federal Reserve tightening, as well as trade protectionism and the Chinese renminbi’s weakening against the dollar since the end of April could all help cause stock indexes such as the Hang Seng to “adjust to the downside quite rapidly,” Garner said.
Oil prices that have charged ahead this year have been a drag for more than 80 percent of emerging markets, even as they provide a boost to some oil-exporting economies such as Russia, Colombia and Mexico, he said.
Amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions, Garner said he’s watching how auto stocks have been suffering, particularly in Europe and Japan. He sees earnings estimates for technology hardware such as semiconductors and mobile phones coming down, and a global tightening cycle is pressuring financial-sector equities as economies move faster than anticipated on interest-rate hikes.

Once UKAR has completed its sales, it will mark the winding down of another crisis-era intervention made by the government to stabilize Britain's banking sector, with its stake in Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) already sold and the re-privatization of the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) underway again. 
UKAR said it expected to sell 900 million pounds worth of equity release mortgages by the end of this year, with everything else wrapped up by 2021, subject to ongoing supportive market conditions. 

It pointed out that it also needs to consider ""inherent complexities"" in the Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley portfolios, including non-loan business assets and liabilities and pension obligations.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 09:41PM ET</span>",Rising crime pushes Mexico bulletproof car production to record,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Historic levels of violent crime in Mexico have sparked a record increase in the country's car-armoring business, with an industry group predicting a double-digit jump in the number of vehicles bulletproofed this year.
There were more than 25,000 murders across Mexico last year, the highest annual tally since modern records began, government data shows, with 2018 on track to be even worse. 
That insecurity will help drive a 10 percent rise in car-armoring services this year to 3,284 cars, above the previous all-time high in 2012, according to the Mexican Automotive Armor Association (AMBA).
That figure is small relative to the 15,145 cars armored in 2017 in Brazil, which expects to see a 25 percent jump this year.
Demand in Mexico has grown so strong that more global automakers have started bulletproofing cars on their own Mexican production lines as opposed to the usual practice of after-market armoring.
Audi (DE:VOWG_p) began making an armored version of its Q5 light sport utility vehicle exclusively in the central state of Puebla in mid-2017 for local sale and export to Brazil and Argentina. The company declined to give recent sales figures.
Audi's Mexico arm said its factory-made armored Q5, which cost $87,000 locally, was cheaper for consumers than using an after-market firm, which one industry expert estimated would boost the car's cost to more than $95,000 and void the factory guarantee. 
BMW, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz have made armored cars in Mexico for several years.
After being assaulted and robbed multiple times in recent years, Arturo Avila, who owns a security company, now only travels in armored cars to traverse the streets of Mexico City.
""One of the crimes that hurts us most is kidnapping, that's what we're afraid of,"" he said, adding he changed his car every two years.
About 1.5 million cars were sold in Mexico in 2017, but just a tiny portion were armored, since the cars remain a luxury for the affluent and for companies that require executives to travel in bulletproof vehicles with bodyguards, said Avila. 
Those companies include Mexico's largest banks and multinationals like  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) and Procter & Gamble Co. Both companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mexican security companies have also expanded rental and leasing offerings, services that are increasingly popular.

About 80 percent of armored car providers' business is in the private sector, which seeks to protect executives and their families, with the rest from government.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is also President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, said China and the EU had agreed to defend the multilateral trading system. Speaking at a press conference following talks on Monday in Beijing, Liu said China is prepared to face off against U.S.’s tariff threats.
“Unilateralism is on the rise and trade tensions have appeared in major economies,” Liu said. “China and the EU firmly oppose trade unilateralism and protectionism and think these actions may bring recession and turbulence to the global economy.”
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 1.3% and 0.4% lower respectively by 9:48PM ET (01:48 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also traded 1.0% lower.
Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said a report later this week on American restriction on Chinese investments would not be as damaging to growth as markets expected.
""There's no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries that are interfering in any way with our country. This is not the plan,"" he said, adding that the markets were overreacting to recent reports that the administration would restrict foreign investment.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has pressed within the administration for a negotiated settlement to trade disputes with China, denied the measures would be aimed specifically at China.
The restriction is “not specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology,” he said in a tweet on Monday.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>","Trump officials send mixed signals on China investment curbs, markets sink","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conflicting signals from the Trump administration over proposed restrictions on foreign investment in U.S. technology companies, along with news that recently imposed import tariffs are starting to disrupt supply chains, sent global stock markets tumbling on Monday. 
Proposed restrictions on foreign investment in U.S. technology would not just be confined to China, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The forthcoming restrictions would apply ""to all countries that are trying to steal our technology,"" he said.
The U.S. Treasury is due to issue its recommendations on Chinese investment restrictions on Friday.
Late Monday White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro sought to downplay Mnuchin's remarks, telling CNBC television that the restrictions on investments in U.S. technology companies would just target China.
Benchmark Wall Street stock indexes suffered their worst losses in two months on Monday, while safe haven Treasury debt yields fell.
U.S. technology stocks were worst hit. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent of Google, fell 2.6 percent, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 2.75 percent, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dropped 3.0 percent. 
TARIFFS IMPACT SUPPLY CHAINS
The recent imposition of import tariffs by the U.S., and counter-measures by other countries, are also starting to affect global production and supply chains. Some U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs went into effect in April and additional tariffs begin in July. 
Harley-Davidson, the dominant player in the U.S. motorcycle market said on Monday it would not pass on the cost of EU tariffs to customers and instead focus on shifting some U.S. production to other countries. 
Harley shares closed down 5.0 percent and analysts cut their profit forecasts on concerns about how quickly the company would be able to adapt to the 25 percent import duties the European Union began charging on June 22.
Other companies likely to feel the impact of recent U.S. tariffs on imported steel which raise costs for manufacturers, and the counter-measures by China which may hit U.S. exports, include heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE:BA). Caterpillar stock lost 3.7 percent and Boeing fell 7.7 percent on Monday.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DIVISIONS
The conflicting signals on trade policy from the Trump administration reflect deep divisions among policymakers over how hard to push China on demands for changes in trade, technology transfers, and industrial policies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has been reluctant to back steep tariffs on Chinese goods, fearing the impact on global supply chains. Goods assembled and exported in one country often depend on components manufactured in another, after being designed in yet a third country, making the national trade deficit focused on by President Trump an unreliable guide. 
Last month, Mnuchin said a trade war with China was ""on hold"" after officials of the world’s two largest economies held talks in Beijing that were focused on opening more sectors of China's economy and increasing purchases of American goods.
But trade policy advisor Navarro, the administration's harshest China critic, has advocated a far more confrontational approach with Beijing.
“The market is perceiving that politics will become policy,"" said Brian Battle of Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real. The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker.""
""A trade war means lower global GDP. It's bad for growth,"" he said.
CFIUS LANGUAGE 
Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who consults regularly with the administration, said that he believes Mnuchin would prefer to apply the text of a bill working its way through Congress to strengthen national security reviews of U.S. acquisitions to investments by China.
The bill would allow the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review transfers of minority interests in companies dealing with critical infrastructure or critical technology as opposed to full acquisitions.
""I would not, on the investment side, be betting against the Treasury Department,"" Scissors said, noting that Treasury would control implementation of such rules. 
Export controls, on the other hand, are the purview of the U.S. Commerce Department and the National Security Council. Trump administration officials have said they are considering the use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose new restrictions on China, an act widely used to freeze assets after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
Spokespersons for the Treasury and the Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment on their investment and export control plans. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 328.09 points, or 1.33 percent, to 24,252.8, the S&P 500 lost 37.81 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,717.07, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 160.81 points, or 2.09 percent, to 7,532.01.

Earlier policymakers in China moved quickly to temper any potential impact on economic growth from Beijing's trade dispute with the United States. Its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points to spur lending to smaller firms.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 08:27PM ET</span>",U.S. approves first marijuana plant-derived drug for epilepsy,"By Tamara Mathias and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - The U.S. health regulator approved GW Pharmaceuticals Plc's epilepsy treatment on Monday, making it the first cannabis-based drug to win approval in the country and opening floodgates for more research into the medicinal properties of cannabis.
The drug's approval permits its use in patients aged two years and older with Dravet Syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), rare childhood-onset forms of epilepsy that are among the most resistant to treatment.
""This approval serves as a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies,"" said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.
The drug, Epidiolex, is made up of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the hundreds of molecules found in the marijuana plant, and contains less than 0.1 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component that makes people high.
GW Pharma grows its own supply of cannabis in specialized glass houses in the United Kingdom to ensure uniformity in the genetic composition of the plants, which are then processed into a liquid solution of CBD. 
Although THC can induce paranoia, anxiety and hallucinations, CBD has the opposite effect and has been cited by scientists as a potential treatment for mental health issues.
While supporters of legalizing marijuana say the decision is a step in the right direction, businesses reliant on the plant must contend with the federal government's ban on its use. 
Based on the potential for abuse, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) categorizes chemicals into five schedules, with Schedule 1 substances - like marijuana and heroin - considered the most deadly and deemed to have no medical benefits. 
As a result, Epidiolex's launch remains at the discretion of the DEA, which must now evaluate the drug and consider reclassifying it as a substance that has medical properties, so as to allow GW to begin selling it.
GW said it expects the reclassification to occur within 90 days. The company has not yet set a price for the drug and said it would work with insurance providers to ensure the medicine would be covered under health plans. 
GW's Nasdaq-listed shares marginally fell in afternoon trading. The stock has run up nearly 50 percent in the past 12 months. 
Most patients with LGS and DS require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved anti-epileptic drugs. 
The two epilepsy forms are severe and associated with high rates of mortality. Some LGS patients have to wear helmets to avoid brain injuries from ""drop seizures"", where muscles suddenly become limp and cause standing patients to collapse. 
Epidiolex would also be the first approved therapy for DS, treatments for which are currently limited to a combination of seizure medication and drugs to prevent emergencies. 
Treatments available for both disorders are far from perfect and some patients resort to buying ""self-prescribed"" CBD online or from unregulated vendor sites, Dr. Pavel Klein, founder of the Mid-Atlantic Epilepsy and Sleep Center, said.
""I hope patients have conversations with their physicians about whether this product (Epidiolex) provides them with treatment they have been looking for with other unapproved products,"" said Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director of regulatory programs at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 

(This version of the story has been refiled to correct paragraph 12 to show DEA must make a decision within 90 days of FDA approving a medicine, instead of there is no time limit.)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports mostly shield consumers by targeting supply-chain components - but lurking inside the tariff lists are some surprises, from Google Nest thermostats to vaping devices to equipment used by aspiring rock stars.
In an escalating tit-fot-tat trade war, the United States has threatened to impose duties on up to $450 billion of Chinese imports, with the first $34 billion portion set to go into effect next month.
The first round of tariffs seeks to avoid consumer end products, suggesting a carefully crafted strategy to avoid a direct tax on voters.
But some consumer items will be affected, a Reuters analysis showed. And should the Trump administration escalate tariffs to the full $450 billion as threatened, it would have to put tariffs on just about everything. The United States imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year.
""By the time you get to $200 billion, you're going to start to affect products consumed by every member of the family,"" said Hun Quach, vice president of international trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.
According to a Reuters analysis of the 1,102 products targeted by the United States Trade Representative office, initially just 1 percent that will have a 25 percent tariff slapped on them in stages from July 6 are ""consumer goods.""
Under the categories developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the most comprehensive database for determining the uses of goods traded between two countries, most of the targeted products are classified as either ""capital goods"" or ""intermediate items.""
The idea is to force companies to shift their supply chains away from China or boost efficiencies to make up any cost differences. But ultimately, that would still hurt U.S. consumers, industry leaders say.
""From our perspective, it kind of doesn't matter where in the supply chain you impose the tariff, because it's ultimately going to be a tax on Americans,"" said Josh Kallmer, senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industries Council, which represents major tech firms.
The industry classifications throw up some perhaps unexpected groupings, indicating what economists say is the arbitrary impact of tariffs.
For instance, the Nest thermostat, assembled in China and sold in the United States by Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google for around $250, is classified in the ""capital goods category"" of imports and will be subject to the tariffs.
Imports of Chinese-made vaping devices to the tune of $300 million a year will be hit, as will $16 million of electronics effects units, used by rock bands to distort guitar sounds.
Under the OECD product categories, both of these fall into a $1.1 billion U.S. category of miscellaneous electrical equipment proposed for a second, $16 billion round of tariffs.
The Buick Envision, a mid-sized sport-utility vehicle from General Motors Co's (N:GM) stable, is also on the list. Built in China, it sold 41,000 units in the United States last year.
Chinese-made cars from Volvo, owned by China's Geely (HK:0175), also face U.S. tariffs, though Volvo recently launched its own U.S. production at a plant in South Carolina.
Cellphones have so far been excluded, the USTR said last week. That would mean Apple's (O:AAPL) Chinese-assembled iPhone would not be impacted. Some 61 million were imported last year, data from researchers Counterpoint and IHS Markit shows.

NOT ALL CHINESE FIRMS
Most of the companies that will suffer from the first rounds of tariffs are not actually Chinese firms, according to research from Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely.
Using Chinese export data, she and researcher Yang Liang found that 87 percent of electronics-related products targeted were from non-Chinese multinationals and foreign-invested joint ventures.
Chinese semiconductor products, for example, largely use chips from the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan. Low-level assembly, packaging and testing work is done in China.
""People who say we can hurt China more because we buy more from them don't really understand how the trade flows work,"" said Lovely.
The flows from China to the United States include oxides of lanthanum, a rare earth metal where imports only come from China, used in Toyota (T:7203) Prius car batteries and catalytic hydrocracking of petroleum. 

China also has a 99 percent share of U.S. imports of several categories of LED lamps, totaling more than $1.1 billion last year. In ceiling light fixtures, classified as intermediate goods but often sold to consumers, China supplied 91 percent of all imports, at $697 million last year.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>",Trump tariffs force companies to rework supply chains,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - From global manufacturers such as Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) to small tech startups, companies are scrambling to rework supply chains built for an era of stable, open trade policy that is now under threat.
As U.S. President Donald Trump pushes to upend the status quo of global trade, companies that initially took a wait-and-see stance are starting to take action to shield their businesses from shifting trade policy. 
On Monday, U.S. motorcycle maker Harley warned of higher costs because of retaliatory EU tariffs, and said it would shift production of bikes destined for the European Union out of the United States to factories it has built in India, Brazil and Thailand.
The decision of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company, which Trump vowed to make great again when he took office, came less than a week after Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) cut its 2018 profit forecast, citing growing trade tensions. Its German rival BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was considering ""possible strategic options"" in view of the rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Harley is the latest example of how companies are finding themselves in the crosshairs following ""tit-for-tat"" retaliations over Trump's bid to rewrite global trade rules as part of his ""America First"" agenda.
Office furniture maker  Steelcase Inc  (N:SCS) last week reported a 230 basis-point fall in the gross margins of its American business in the first quarter due to higher raw materials costs following Trump's metal import tariffs.
Although it increased prices earlier this month, the second increase in four months, Steelcase said it expected profit margins to remain under pressure for another quarter or two.
""A manufacturer can no longer assume that the direction of trade policy is towards freer and freer trade over time,"" Dustin Burke, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, told Reuters last month.
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimate that the U.S. tariffs along with the retaliatory duties imposed or under consideration by trade partners will affect 1 percent of global trade. But for some companies, that 1 percent covers a much larger share of their supply chain.

SEARCH FOR RESILIENT OPTIONS
It is not clear how Washington's trade dispute with China and other partners will be resolved, and that has many companies still reluctant to take actions that could take years to pay off.
""If you tell us what the rules are, we'll determine the best way to position the capacity and to go about the investment,"" said Michael Lamach, chief executive of heating and air-conditioning product maker Ingersoll-Rand Plc (N:IR). ""What you need is certainty around the rules.""
The uncertainty has been a bonanza for supply chain consultants, who are helping clients assess potential replacements for Chinese and other non-U.S. suppliers.
Chicago-based Peter Guarraia, a partner at Bain & Co, last month covered three continents in just two weeks. After scouting for vendors in India and Thailand, Guarraia flew to Atlanta, Mexico and then to the UK to evaluate supply chains.
""We are all over the place,"" he said late last month. ""A lot of our clients are asking, 'How do we turn our supply chains from a necessary evil into a competitive weapon?'""
Companies routinely examine supply chains to make them more competitive, but until now very few mapped vulnerability to trade risks beyond their primary suppliers, said Brett Weaver, a partner at KPMG. 
NO EASY CHOICES
Complex and decades-old supply chains cannot be shifted to different countries or facilities easily. 
Some businesses work with contracts anywhere from six to nine months in advance of delivery, while others have multi-year contracts with their suppliers. For some manufacturers like those of medical devices, changing suppliers is not possible without regulatory approval.
In some cases, companies have no option but to stay put as there are no alternatives to existing suppliers.
Take  Varian Medical  Systems Inc (N:VAR), which makes cancer-fighting radiation therapy systems. The Palo Alto, California-based company uses tungsten in one of its components. It imports the metal from China which has the bulk of global tungsten production. The United States does not have any domestic commercial production of primary tungsten, the company said.
'MADE IN AMERICA'
HiberSense, a small startup that sells internet-connected home climate control systems, decided early this month to end its reliance on imports of thermostats from China and fast-track a plan to manufacture the devices in Pennsylvania. 
""We don't want to be subjected to these ebbs and flows of political environment,"" Chief Revenue Officer Bob Fields said in an interview. ""We would much rather be in control of what we are doing.""
It will take minimum of nine months and at least $200,000 in research and development before the two-year-old startup can begin production. Until then, Fields says the company will have no option but to pay an additional 25 percent tariff on the shipments of thermostats from China, and hope that its customers would accept the increased costs. 

Fields said the tariffs would increase the average retail price of HiberSense systems to above $2,000 per unit from about $1,900 earlier.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Europe to retaliate if U.S. imposes auto tariffs: France,"PARIS (Reuters) - Europe will hit back if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with a threat to slap import tariffs on European-made cars, France's finance minister said on Monday.
Trump escalated already burning trade tensions on Friday by threatening to hit all imports of cars assembled in the European Union (EU) with a 20 percent tariff.
The threat comes shortly after the United States imposed tariffs on European-made steel and aluminum in a move Washington's NATO allies blasted as unjustifiable.
""If the United States hits us again with a 20 percent increase on cars we will respond again. We don't want an escalation, but we are the ones being attacked,"" Le Maire told the Anglo-American Press Association.
Trump posted his threat on Twitter the day European Union reprisals took effect against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The EU targeted $3.2 billion in American goods exported to the 28-member bloc, including bourbon and Harley Davidsons (N:HOG).
The company said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the EU from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90-100 million a year.
Reacting to the news, Le Maire said: ""Whatever allows jobs to be created in Europe goes in the right direction. We don't want a trade war, but we will defend ourselves.""
Tariffs are not the only point of trade frictions between Europe and the United States. 
EU countries are also furious about U.S. sanctions their companies will be subject to for doing business with Iran following Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 international nuclear deal.
Le Maire said he had so far not received ""positive signs"" from Washington about joint French, German and British requests for exemptions from the sanctions.

""For the moment, our requests remain unanswered,"" he said

1509,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says Harley ‘First to Wave White Flag’ in His EU Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump accused Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). of surrendering in his budding trade war with the EU after the company said it would relocate production outside the U.S. in response to European retaliatory tariffs.
“Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag,” Trump said in a tweet shortly after departing the White House on the presidential helicopter. “I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!”
The company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the EU in response to Trump’s penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.
“To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,” the company said.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump’s “trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.”
“The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the E.U. will join is in that,” Sanders told reporters at the White House."
1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 05:56PM ET</span>",Harley-Davidson to move some production out of U.S. to avoid EU tariffs,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said on Monday it would move U.S. production of motorcycles for European Union customers overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs that could cost the company up to $100 million per year. 
Harley shares plunged as much as 7 percent and analysts cut their profit forecasts on concerns about how quickly the company would be able to adapt to the 25 percent import duties the European Union began charging on June 22.
U.S. President Donald Trump has held up Harley as an example of a manufacturer that would benefit from his policies. But the proposed production shift appeared to mark an unintended consequence of U.S. tariffs imposed on European steel and aluminum earlier this month.
""We think Harley's decision to protect EU demand is wise for the long-term health of the market,"" Baird Equity Research said in a note. ""But we expect the near-term impact to weigh on estimates and sentiment until a clearer path to mitigation is outlined.""
In a regulatory filing, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company said the retaliatory duties would result in an incremental cost of about $2,200 per average motorcycle exported from the United States to the European Union, but did not provide more details on current motorcycle costs.
Harley's entry-level bike in France currently costs 7,490 euros ($8,766). 
The company said it would not raise retail or wholesale prices for its dealers, and expects the tariffs to result in incremental costs of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of 2018 and $80 million to $100 million on a full-year basis.
Trump vowed to make the iconic motorcycle maker great again when he took office last year. But since then the company has been counting the costs of his trade policies. 
In late April, Harley said Trump's metal tariffs would inflate its costs by $15 million to $20 million this year on top of already rising raw material prices that it expected at the start of the year.
White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday the administration wants Harley to make more motorcycles in the United States. 
""Remember, they came to us, for example, pointing out that India had a 100 percent tariff on Harley Davidsons. That's certainly not fair,"" Navarro told CNBC.
""We want Harleys made here, more made here, and that's going to happen under the president's trade policies.""
In response to Navarro's comments, a Harley spokesman said the company made its position clear in Monday's filing.
EUROPEAN BUSINESS 
Struggling to overcome a slump in U.S. demand, Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its iconic motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently.
In January, the company announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Missouri as part of a consolidation plan after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years.
In 2017, Harley sold nearly 40,000 new motorcycles in Europe which accounted for more than 16 percent of the company's sales last year. The revenues from EU countries were second only to the United States. 
Harley said ramping up production at overseas international plants could take at least nine to 18 months. It has three assembly plants outside the United States - one each in Brazil, India and Thailand.
The company decided to build the Thailand plant in response to Trump's decision to pull out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership which would have lowered import tariffs on its bikes in some of the fastest-growing motorcycle markets in Asia.
The company said it will provide more details of the financial implications of retaliatory EU tariffs and its plans to offset their impact on July 24 when its second-quarter earnings are due. 
Analysts at Baird Equity Research cut its 2018 profit estimates for Harley-Davidson to $3.70 per share from $3.90 and now expect 2019 profit of $3.85, down from $4.20.
CFRA Research lowered its 12-month price target for the stock to $47 from $49.
Harley-Davidson's shares fell as much as 7 percent on Monday, before paring some losses in late trading. Its shares have lost about 9 percent since early March when the trade skirmish between the United States and the EU started, and are down over 18 percent since end-December 2017. 
Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) last week cut its 2018 profit forecast citing growing trade tensions. Its German rival BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was considering ""possible strategic options"" in view of the rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Trump has also threatened to crackdown on auto imports. Analysts at Moody's reckon a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles and parts would be negative for most of companies including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM).

Brokers with Wells Fargo Advisors, from January 2009 to June 2013, encouraged retail customers to sell market-linked investments meant to be held to maturity so they could replace them with new products, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement Monday. Wells Fargo supervisors approved the “flipping,” which hurt clients’ returns, in violation of internal policies, the SEC said.
“It is important that brokers do their homework before they recommend that their retail customers buy or sell complex structured products,” Daniel Michael, head of the SEC’s complex financial products unit, said in the agency’s statement. “The products sold by Wells Fargo came with high fees and commissions, which Wells Fargo should have taken into account before advising retail customers to sell their investments.”
The SEC has been focusing on the products, which have been criticized for their high fees and lack of transparency. The agency fined Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s Merrill Lynch unit in June 2016 for misleading investors and also sued UBS Group AG in October 2015 over statements tied to a currency-linked structured note.
Wells Fargo resolved the case without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. The bank agreed to pay a $4 million fine and return $1.1 million in ill-gotten gains and interest.
“We are committed to helping our clients achieve their investment goals and cooperated fully with the SEC’s investigation,” Shea Leordeanu, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said in an email. “We previously made policy and supervision changes related to this matter to improve internal controls.”
The SEC settlement is separate from a review of Wells Fargo’s wealth-management business that the bank flagged in its annual regulatory filing."

1515,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>","Markets Are on Edge, and So Are Bond Dealers","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The global stock market as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index fell as much as 1.71 percent on Monday, its biggest drop since March. Investors pinned the decline on concern that a budding trade dispute between the U.S. and its chief partners will steamroll into something much bigger that drags down the global economy. Perhaps cooler heads will prevail before it gets that bad, but those who control what is considered the most important market in the world don’t seem too optimistic. 
The 23 primary dealers of U.S. government securities, which are authorized to trade with the Federal Reserve and obligated to bid at the Treasury Department’s bond auctions, have built up their holdings of Treasuries and related debt to $150 billion, a record. Given their unique access to the central bank and the amount of trading volume that they experience daily, the surge in holdings begs the question of why dealers, whose members include JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), would be loading up on the safest investment in the world if they didn’t see some pretty severe storm clouds building in the global economy. Some might say that it’s just a byproduct of the growing amount of debt outstanding. Perhaps, but debt outstanding has been growing for years, and there has been no discernible correlation with dealer holdings. Plus, holdings of Treasuries and government agency debt by banks in general has started to rise again, reaching a record $2.54 trillion, based on Fed data released late Friday, after dropping this year through April.
More than a few investors and strategists feel that the global economy and corporate earnings are at a peak and have nowhere to go but down. Officials in both China and the European Union have said in recent days that unilateral trade actions like the kind sought by the U.S. risk pushing the world into a recession. And what about all that talk about a bear market in bonds? It seems more strategists are reconsidering. “We suggest investors buy 10-year Treasury notes outright,” Morgan Stanley global head of interest-rate strategy Matthew Hornbach wrote in a note to clients Friday. He was right, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped to 2.88 percent, moving further below the psychologically important 3 percent level. STOCK HEADWINDS GET STRONGERMany prognosticators have pointed to the outperformance of U.S. equities in recent weeks as a sign that investors think the Trump administration has the upper hand as trade tensions escalate. Maybe so, but that thinking was absent Monday as the S&P 500 Index fell in sympathy with its global peers. Regardless of whether you think the U.S. can come out ahead in a trade war, the headwinds are growing stronger for equities. Although Wall Street analysts project revenue growth in the second quarter to accelerate slightly to 8.7 percent from 8.5 percent in the first three months, according to DataTrek Research, earnings growth will slow to 19 percent from 24.7 percent. That’s still incredibly high, of course, but the point is that profit margins are eroding in a trend that’s not likely to sit well with investors already fretting about historically high valuations. On top of that, JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report Friday that it appears this quarter’s gains in U.S. equities are due primarily to corporate stock buybacks. They figure that U.S. companies deployed the majority of the offshore cash that was repatriated in the first quarter, which totaled $217 billion, into buybacks. In other words, if companies stop buying back their shares with the money they are bringing home, watch out.
DOLLAR REGIME CHANGEThe big rally in the dollar starting in mid-April that caught most everyone by surprise is running out of steam. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has weakened for four consecutive days after surging 6.28 percent between April 16 and June 19. The idea that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates while most of the developed world stood pat dominated strategists’ explanations for the dollar’s ascent. Maybe the better one was that the rally was due largely to a sort of short squeeze in the dollar. The dollar’s move largely tracks positioning of hedge funds and other large speculators as measured by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Positioning reached its most bearish in mid-April before traders began unwinding what had been lucrative bets until then on the dollar’s decline. Those wagers have been steadily unwound since then, coinciding with the dollar’s rebound until finally CFTC data released late Friday showed that net positioning in the dollar was bullish for the first time since the end of 2017. Goldman Sachs is one firm that doesn’t recommend jumping on the dollar bandwagon just yet. In a report late last week, the firm's foreign-exchange strategist wrote that the greenback is likely to depreciate in the second half of the year.
EM SELL-OFF LURES UBSEmerging-market financial assets slid again on Monday, with the MSCI EM Index of equities dropping to its lowest since August and a separate MSCI index tracking their currencies plumbing is lowest levels of the year. Outside of some minor respites here and there, developing-market assets have steadily declined this quarter. All along, plenty of big name firms have suggested that the sell-off was overdone and have been proved wrong. Now, UBS AG is throwing its hat into the ring, with the firm’s wealth-management unit saying that these assets are poised to rally in the second half of 2018, with stocks potentially set for a 15 percent gain, according to Bloomberg News’s Ben Bartenstein. Like the Goldman Sachs strategists, UBS emerging-markets chief investment officer Jorge Mariscal expects the dollar to weaken, which will take some pressure off of developing-nation equities, bonds and currencies. Plus, Mariscal told Bloomberg News that he expects the trajectory for interest rates to become clearer and trade threats to die down. There may be something to that outlook. Although JPMorgan on Friday cut its year-end target for the MSCI EM Index to 1,230 from 1,300, that’s still above the 1,071 level where it was trading on Monday.
OIL MARKET LACKS CONVICTIONAfter surging on Friday by more than 3 percent on the decision by OPEC and its allies to boost production by only a small amount, oil prices gave back 0.8 percent of those gains on Monday as the dust cleared. But here’s the thing: It’s still unclear how much more supply will actually be poured into the market despite the group saying it will add 1 million barrels to daily supplies, and which countries will be responsible for it, according to Bloomberg News’s Jessica Summers. “This is a market lacking conviction, leadership and any sense of what’s going to happen next,” Walter Zimmermann, chief technical analyst at ICAP-TA, told Bloomberg News. “If anything, we’re ending the day with more questions than we began the day with.” Several ministers said that, in reality, the accord would add a smaller amount of oil to the market — about 700,000 barrels a day — because several countries are unable to raise their output. Going into the meeting, hedge funds kept their West Texas Intermediate net-long position — the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop — little changed, cutting it by only by 0.4 percent to 313,867 futures and options during the week ended June 19, CFTC data show. Longs dipped 0.6 percent, while shorts fell 2.1 percent.
TEA LEAVESThe Conference Board will release its monthly report on consumer confidence Tuesday, and the consensus among economists surveyed by Bloomberg is that June’s report will remain near the highest levels since 2000. But beyond the headlines, some interesting trends are developing in the data that suggest consumer sentiment may soon be headed lower. First, although the survey’s present situations index has soared, the index measuring consumers’ outlook for the future is little changed this year. As a result, the gap between the two has trended wider, just as it did in the late 1990s just before the economy entered a recession. Bloomberg Intelligence economists Carl Riccadonna and Niraj Shah wrote in a Friday report that although “such a pattern can persist for an extended period” and “is not a foreboding signal of an imminent downturn,” it is “typical of the middle-to-later stages of an economic cycle.”

1. Consumer Confidence, Fed Speak, Housing Data on Tap
While top-tier economic data and Fed speakers slated for Tuesday is likely to take a backseat to any uptick in trade war rhetoric, consumer confidence and housing data will be closely scrutinise for signs the U.S. economy remains on solid footing.
The S&P/CS Composite-20 HPI due 9am ET – measuring the change in the selling price of single-family homes in twenty metropolitan areas across the United States – is expected to show growth of 6.9% in April, a slight uptick from 6.8% seen the prior month.
Economist forecast the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge due 10:00 am ET to show a cooler reading of 127.6 for June from 128 in the previous month.
The Richmond Fed manufacturing index data for June due 10:00 am ET is expected to decrease to 15 from a reading of 16 the prior month.
Potential clues on U.S. monetary policy will likely also garner attention with a speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President, Raphael Bostic, at 1:00 p.m. ET and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kapan slated for 1:45 p.m. ET.
The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Monday amid fears the United States is reportedly drawing up fresh tariffs. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attempted to ease investor jitters, insisting that ""things are bullish here in America.""
2. Draw in Crude Supplies to Continue?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday after data last week showed a draw in crude inventories.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 3.016 million barrels for the week ended June 15. That was below the 5.914 million barrel decline reported by the Energy Information Administration during the same period.
Crude oil futures fell 50 cents to settle at $68.08 a barrel as traders continued to assess OPEC's decision to lift output, while a supply outage inCanada kept losses in check.
3. Harley-Davidson to Bounce Back From Ride Lower?
Shares of Harley Davidson were showing fighting spirit in after-hours trade following a sharp fall Monday after the company confirmed its motorcycles exported from the U.S. to the European Union would be subject to higher tariffs.
Harley-Davidson stated that European Union tariffs on its motorcycles exported from the U.S. have increased from 6% to 31%. This comes as the EU tariffs on a list of U.S. goods and iconic brands including Harley-Davidson's motorbikes were implemented on June 22.
The higher tariffs are expected to average an incremental $2,200 per motorcycle exported from the U.S. to the EU.
Management said they decided against raising MSRP’s or wholesale prices to cover the costs of the EU's retaliatory tariffs as it would have both an immediate and lasting impact on the sustainability of its dealers’ business.
Absorbing the tariffs would set the motorbike manufacturer back about $30M to $45M in the remainder of 2018, and $90M to $100M on an annual basis.
Harley said it will shift production of motorcycles bound for the EU to international manufacturing facilities in a bid to sidestep the tariffs. The transition, however, is expected to take between 9 and 18 months.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo fined by SEC over investment sales misconduct,"By Jonathan Stempel and Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will pay more than $5.1 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it improperly pushed retail customers to actively trade complex investments in order to generate higher fees.
The SEC on Monday said the payout includes a $4 million civil fine, plus the return of ill-gotten gains and interest, over misconduct by the Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage in its sale of so-called market-linked investments.
Wells Fargo was accused of reducing investor returns by encouraging customers to actively trade the investments though they were intended to be held to maturity, and despite an internal policy prohibiting ""short-term trading"" and ""flipping.""
The San Francisco-based bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but has taken steps to address sales practices that occurred from January 2009 to June 2013, the SEC said.
Wells Fargo said in a statement it has made policy and management changes related to the SEC charges, and is committed to helping customers achieve their investment goals.
Wells Fargo has been plagued for nearly two years by scandals over how it treated its customers, including by selling them products they did not need to meet internal sales goals.
It has overhauled management and is trying to regain trust, including through an ad campaign saying that Wells Fargo was established in 1852 and ""re-established"" in 2018.

Market-linked investments are fixed-maturity products whose interest rate is determined by the performance of a particular asset or market measure, such as equity and commodity indexes.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",BMW executive says would shut UK plants if Brexit hits supply chain,"By David Milliken and Edward Taylor
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) would have to close its Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) plants in Britain if Brexit seriously disrupts its supply chain, an executive at the German carmaker told the Financial Times.
The warning follows concerns voiced last week by the head of Siemens' (DE:SIEGn) operations in Britain, who told Reuters that the country should stay in the European Union customs union, contrary to the British government's policy.
""We always said we can do our best and prepare everything, but if at the end of the day the supply chain will have a stop at the border, then we cannot produce our products in the UK,"" BMW customs manager Stephan Freismuth was quoted as saying.
Around 60 percent of the 378,000 Minis made by BMW last year rolled off the production line in Oxford. Its factories in Swindon, Hams Hall and Oxford currently employ around 6,300 workers to make BMW engines and Mini vehicles. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) has also warned that British jobs would be under threat from a 'no deal' Brexit, drawing criticism from government ministers who said such comments undermined Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating position.
BMW's Freismuth added that the company wanted to keep its British plants open and was working on contingency plans, but that any disruption to imports of components would increase costs and damage its 'just in time' manufacturing model.
About 90 percent of the parts used in BMW's British factories come from mainland Europe.
""If you have a stop for one day, it costs a lot of money, but at the end if there are more stops our management have to decide how this can be sorted,"" he said.
A BMW spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to our manufacturing operations in the UK and continue to operate business as usual, as we work through a range of possible Brexit outcomes and their potential impact on our business.""
BMW however warned that the lack of clarity surrounding future customs arrangements remains a cause for concern.
""As previously stated, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations is not helpful when it comes to making long-term business decisions,"" BMW said. 
BMW's just-in-time production system requires the free movement of parts and goods. 
""Clearly if parts cannot physically get to a factory at the expected time, that factory will not run as smoothly and reliably as is desirable,” BMW said. 
A spokesman for the British government said it was confident of securing a good deal with the EU that allows for the ""most free and frictionless trade with our European neighbours"". 

""We are working with the sector to put the UK at the forefront of new automotive technologies to ensure we remain the destination of choice for future investment,"" he said.

COMMENTS:
RANDY FREDERICK, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas
“The things that have caused this market to not be happy at the beginning of the day have not abated at all. As a result there is no reason to think it won’t weaken into the close.
""The 50-day (moving average) was providing a little bit of support right at the get-go and then the 100-day sort of looked like it was the stop but if I am a technical guy I am worried about the 200-day now, which is frankly, a ways down there. That is 2,6664, that is not a number I want to get anywhere near. But if you look back at the pullbacks we had in early April and early May both of them didn’t really bounce until they hit the 200-day, so I would be a little cautious here. 
""This is an incredibly tough market to not only forecast but also to trade because fundamentals are really strong everywhere – corporate earnings are great, labor market is great, everything is great – but you can’t trade technicals when everything is going on is being driven by news and geopolitical tensions. So how do you predict the next hour or next day what might come out of Washington? I just don’t know how you trade this thing, I don’t know how you forecast it, because you don’t know. It is a tough one. I can only forecast based on fundamentals and technicals, I can’t predict the news. 
""As long as this stuff is out there and until we see somebody backpedaling, we see somebody flinch, we see some progress in negotiations which we all think is part of the game, we haven’t see any of that, I would be cautious here. I don’t like it, I hate to think this kind of stuff could derail all of the fundamental strength we have but in the near-term, it looks like it.” 
WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK: 
“People are scared, the market does not like uncertainty. And a trade war is something that is difficult, if not impossible, to handicap. A lot of profit taking on stocks that had been leaders. Selling in the cyclical and big industrial international stocks – that’s a continuation – and until people get some clarity, it may be difficult for investors to show a lot of conviction in terms of being long.” 
PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: 
“The story out there today is about trade tensions with China, the latest development with regard to limiting investment in U.S. firms. We’re seeing some areas holding up reasonably well: telecom, utilities and consumer staples. Industrials and technology stocks, with their extended valuations, are the sectors that are struggling today.
“[Future market performance] depends a lot on the statements we hear from the respective parties. I don’t expect a rebound, but I don’t expect the pace of selling we’re seeing today to continue either.”
ANDREW FRANKEL, CO-PRESIDENT OF STUART FRANKEL & CO IN NEW YORK: 
""It was a technical level the S&P broke (the 100 day moving average). When we broke that it sold off and now you're seeing it hovering around that level.""
""Amidst a day the volume isn't robust, technical levels can play a key role ... That added a little fuel to the move lower. Overall from a trading perspective you see a self-fulfilling prophesy. The lower the tape goes, people will rein in exposure. Sometimes selling begets selling. There's a backdrop of trade concerns.""
""We're due for some sort of pullback. You've multiple sectors getting hurt. It makes me feel you've got exposure being taken down.""
J. BRYANT EVANS, INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, COZAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS:
""I do think tariff talk is at the front of investors' minds and is what is influencing the market more than anything else today. It's really hard to know just how all of this is going to shake out. For sure, we are looking at negative issues for U.S. agriculture products, for steel and other basic materials, especially aluminum, and also how all of the tit-for-tat shakes out with different countries. That's going to affect different companies differently.
There's just a lot of uncertainty about whether the plans are going to work out for the better or not.""
BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO
“The market is perceiving that politics will become policy. The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real. The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker. We'll keep trading off if the trend persists.”
""A trade war means lower global GDP. It's bad for growth. What we've seen in the last nine days was a measured sell off. We're still barely positive for the year.”
""The rhetoric is foreboding. It’s not sounding better and the deadline is getting closer."" 
""There's going to be a measured retreat. You want to have appropriate window dressing for quarter end. You can't have a bunch of cash you have to have a positions. That's part of why its measured.""
ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
“It’s now all about the whole trade dialogue, which seems to be going in the wrong direction. Most market participants and most companies would really like to see a resolution of trade policy so people understand what the polices are.""
“I think everybody recognizes that globalization has been a great thing... This position that we are taking currently, not only with the Chinese, who I think are the primary target of all this trade talk, but even with our friends, is unsettling.""
""The market in general has hung in there really well with the belief that this is a negotiating strategy, that these things aren’t actually going to happen.”
“It’s seeming like it is. It’s beginning to seem like these positions that are extreme and punitive are actually not just a negotiating strategy, it looks like they might be reality. And if they're reality, then it causes all kinds of disruption to global business endeavors. Pretty much every company in their supply chain...suddenly they have got a cost or an uncertainty.”
“As it seems that this is not just a negotiating tactic, this could be reality, that is beginning to unnerve the market.”

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Ex-State Street executive pulled 'bait-and-switch' on clients: U.S. prosecutor,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A former  State Street  Corp (N:STT) executive engaged in ""bait-and switch"" by promising to charge several of the bank's clients low fees to execute billions of dollars of trades before secretly applying commissions to them, a U.S. prosecutor said on Monday.
Ross McLellan, a former executive vice president, sought to defraud customers including Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund and European pension funds out of millions of dollars, prosecutor William Johnston told a federal jury in Boston.
In his closing argument following three weeks of trial, Johnston said the evidence showed McLellan from 2010 to 2011 directed employees to charge customers the hidden commissions in order to ""secretly pick the pockets of State Street's clients.""
He said that McLellan, with the help of two other executives who testified against him at trial, overcharged the customers despite the bank promising them low fees and to act in their best interest.
""At its the heart, it was one of the oldest and most basic frauds out there: bait-and-switch,"" said Johnston, an attorney with the U.S. Justice Department.
But Martin Weinberg, McLellan's lawyer, said his client never intended to defraud anyone and believed the mark-ups were allowed under the customers' contracts.
He urged jurors to discredit the testimony of the prosecution's star witnesses, Edward Pennings and Richard Boomgaardt, the two other State Street executives who pleaded guilty in 2017.
Weinberg said both men saw McLellan as their ""ticket to freedom"" as they had agreed to testify against him in hopes of leniency at sentencing, a fact that had ""corrupted"" their testimony in the securities fraud trial.
""If you don't trust them, the government's case falls,"" Weinberg said.
The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the Boston-based bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six clients mark-ups on certain transactions. 
In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement. 

The six clients included the Kuwait Investment Authority and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds. 
All six utilized the bank's ""transition management” business, which helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios. 
Prosecutors said McLellan also defrauded a New York-based unit of insurance company AXA SA (PA:AXAF) by applying hidden fees to trades conducted on its behalf.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",U.S. chip stocks sink after new trade measures aimed at tech,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor stocks slumped on Monday, including deep losses in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Nvidia, as new measures targeting the technology sector in President Donald Trump's trade conflict with China triggered a wave of investor fear.
Intel, Micron Technology and Nvidia each fell at least 4 percent in afternoon trade, pushing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down 3.7 percent and putting it on track for its biggest one-day drop since April.
""Semis are macroeconomy-related and the supply chain is global. Trade wars are not going to be good for semiconductors,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. ""We don't know what to expect.""
In the latest escalation of Trump's conflict with Beijing, the U.S. Treasury Department was drafting curbs that would block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. technology firms.
In addition, The Wall Street Journal said the Commerce Department and National Security Council were proposing “enhanced” export controls to keep such technologies from being shipped to China, increasing uncertainty from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. The S&P 500 dropped 1.8 percent on Monday.
Tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the first of a potential total of $450 billion, are due to take effect on July 6 over U.S. complaints that China is misappropriating U.S. technology through joint venture rules and other policies.
A key danger for U.S. chipmakers is tariffs on products manufactured in China that are built with U.S. components. 
Imports of semiconductor-dense products like televisions and smartphones so far have been spared by Trump, but they could be hit if the trade dispute grows. A proposed list of Chinese products under review for potential tariffs includes semiconductors.
S&P 500 chip companies on average rely on China for a quarter of their revenue, more than any industry other than casinos, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Reflecting how complex global manufacturing supply chains have become in recent decades, most U.S. chip companies manufacture their products in Taiwan, South Korea and other countries outside of the United States. 
Even Intel, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Micron Technology, which are among the few major U.S. companies with large factories in the United States, export their chips to countries including Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam for additional testing and assembly. From those countries, the finished products are exported to China, where they go into manufactured products that are then exported to consumers around the world.
The following are S&P 500 semiconductor companies and their estimated revenue exposure to China, based on Thomson Reuters data.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>",Massachusetts regulator charges Metlife over unpaid pensions,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts' securities regulator on Monday accused MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) of making false statements to investors related to its failure to pay pension benefits to thousands of retirees that it improperly treated as ""presumed dead.""
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, charged MetLife following a probe that began after the insurer revealed in December it had failed to make payments to retirees.
In an administrative complaint, Galvin's office accused MetLife of making misleading statements to investors regarding the sufficiency of the reserves it was required to maintain to meet its obligations to pensioners.
Following December's revelation, MetLife in February announced it would increase those reserves by $510 million. The New York-based company has estimated that the number of retirees affected, both in and outside Massachusetts, is about 13,500.
The complaint seeks an order requiring MetLife to locate all of the hundreds of Massachusetts retirees eligible for benefits and provide them retroactive and continuing payments. It also seeks sanctions, censure and an administrative fine.
MetLife in a statement said it has ""taken aggressive steps to locate unresponsive annuitants who are due funds and already have or will commence payment, including interest, once the necessary paperwork is complete.""
The Massachusetts investigation is one of several launched by regulators in the wake of MetLife's December announcement. It also faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York's insurance regulator.
The case centers on MetLife's business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employers pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer.
Galvin's complaint said MetLife relied on inadequate procedures to contact retirees, many of whom may not have known the company took over their former employers' pension responsibilities. 
MetLife's efforts to contact them primarily involved sending two perfunctory letters at age 65 and 70-1/2, and when retirees did not respond to them, MetLife categorized them as ""presumed dead,"" the complaint said.
By marking someone as ""presumed dead,"" the assets to which he or she was entitled were released from the reserve, increasing MetLife's bottom line, Galvin alleged.
MetLife made no other attempts to contact them, yet Galvin said his office since launching its probe has been able to locate the majority of Massachusetts residents missing out on the payments.
""They weren't dead at all,"" Galvin said in an interview. ""No serious effort was made to find these people.""

Other big U.S. lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) have successfully built up their credit card business by luring customers with travel and entertainment benefits in recent years.
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said it will sweeten the rewards for one of its premium cards next month, offering three points per dollar spent on dining, traveling and streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for no annual fee.
The move by Wells Fargo comes after the Federal Reserve earlier this year placed a cap on its asset growth until it can prove its governance and risk controls have improved following a string of sales practices scandals. 
Banks like  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) have recorded returns on assets in the credit card business topping 2 percent, making them one of the most profitable consumer loans. 
Wells Fargo, fourth-biggest U.S. lender by assets, had said in 2015 it wanted to double its credit card business over the next few years. But its credit cards have held steady at less than 4 percent of its total loans. (https://reut.rs/2lzYw0I)
Credit cards made up about 30 percent of loans at JPMorgan and 10 percent of loans at Bank of America Corp at the end of the first quarter. (N:BAC)

Wells Fargo’s head of cards and retail services Beverly Anderson said that not having an annual fee will make the card competitive and rewards for everyday activities will help it move to the top of customer’s wallets.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. coal miners worry Trump-China trade dispute could hit exports,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. coal mining companies are worried President Donald Trump’s intensifying trade dispute with China could hurt their booming export business, one of the ailing sector’s most important lifelines, according to industry players.
Beijing this month added coal and other energy products to a list of U.S. goods facing import tariffs in retaliation for Trump administration levies. The measure has already dampened Chinese demand for U.S.-mined coal, multiple U.S. and Chinese industry sources said.
For instance, trade sources said China National Building Material International, one of the biggest metallurgical coal importers in China, pulled back from supply talks with U.S. coal broker XCoal and miner Consol Energy (N:CEIX) shortly after Beijing’s announcement.
A source familiar with the matter said Consol had been in talks with China to supply up to 1 million tons per year of metallurgical coal but would not confirm whether the deal would be delayed. 
Officials at XCoal declined to comment. 
""We’re obviously watching it closely, particularly given what a bright spot exports have been for our industry of late,"" said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, which represents U.S. mining companies.
""Anything that would chip away at the appetite for U.S. coal abroad would be of concern.""
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said U.S. coal exports to Asia doubled from 15.7 million tons in 2016 to 32.8 million tons in 2017. Exports to China totaled 3.2 million tons in 2017, up from zero in 2015 and 2016, according to the EIA.
The coal industry's concerns mirror the unease spreading in U.S. farm country over unintended consequences of the Trump administration’s protectionist stance, which has roiled foreign market for American crops. The farm and coal industries are critical Trump supporters that the president and his Republican party are relying on to help them retain control of Congress in the mid-term elections in November.
""WALKING A TIGHT ROPE"" 
Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, said Trump's protectionism was a ""dilemma"" for his organization, which represents a number of companies benefiting from the export trade.
""Because of our small population, we export far more than we consume,"" he said. 
""We are concerned about the momentum slowing down... We are literally holding our breath to make sure this dispute is part of a bigger picture... and the parties see the advantage of trade with each other.""
Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said he hoped the dispute would blow over, or at least that the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs would boost domestic demand for metallurgical coal. U.S. demand for met coal is currently about 23 million tons a year, and could rise if U.S. steel manufacturing increases.
“We are walking a tight rope,” he said.
The addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs from China also came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms. Just last month, Beijing had been encouraging them to buy more U.S. coal to narrow the trade gap, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.
Coal operators like Pennsylvania's Consol had been in talks with Chinese buyers, and hope those talks revive.
""Long-term we think that coal will be part of the solution, with China buying U.S. coal to offset the trade deficit,"" said Zach Smith, a spokesman for Consol. 
A number of Appalachian operators are banking on it.
In a May investor presentation, Corsa Coal (V:CSO) said it was aiming for 4 million tons per year of metallurgical coal sales by 2020 with 70 percent for export and 30 percent domestic. In its presentation, Corsa said Chinese and Indian infrastructure as well as a rising population were positive drivers for coking coal to serve growing demand for steel.
Corsa Coal did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month, Bluestone Coal (V:BSR), owned by the family of West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, announced it planned to hire 250 workers for two reopened mines and two new metallurgical mines in West Virginia. Some 70 percent of its coal is marketed for overseas export.

A representative for Bluestone could not be reached for comment.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court backs American Express in merchant fee dispute,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sided with  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and against 11 states, ruling that the company's policy of forbidding merchants from encouraging customers to use rival credit cards with lower fees does not violate federal antitrust law.
Handing American Express an important legal victory that validated a key component of its business model, the justices upheld a lower court decision that had cleared the company of unlawfully stifling competition through so-called anti-steering provisions in its contracts with merchants.
The decision was 5-4, with the court's conservative justices in the majority and liberals dissenting. Major retailers panned it as bad for consumers.
Shares of American Express were up 2 percent after the ruling in midday trading. Shares of rivals  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) both fell, with Visa down 2.6 percent and Mastercard off 2.5 percent.
So-called swipe fees paid to credit card companies each time a consumer uses a card for a purchase are a major expense for merchants who annually pay more than $50 billion to process such transactions. 
The business model of American Express depends primarily on merchant fees, while competitors like Visa and MasterCard derive most of their revenues from interest on unpaid balances. American Express has said these fees fund the additional benefits it offers its cardholders compared to its rivals.
New York-based American Express charges merchants higher fees relative to the other credit card networks, and generates more revenue, according to legal papers filed by the states.
The case involved an appeal by the 11 states - Iowa, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont - of a 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that favored American Express.
The states, backed by President Donald Trump's administration, had argued that anti-steering provisions kept fees artificially high, leading to higher retail prices even for people who do not use credit cards. 
'LOSS FOR CONSUMERS'
The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), said the decision will allow American Express to prevent consumers from understanding rising credit card fees. 
""Today's decision is a loss for American consumers,"" the group's general counsel Deborah White said. ""Competition in the credit card space is sorely lacking.""
As a result of advertising campaigns in the 1980s by Visa and MasterCard aimed at convincing merchants and consumers to use cards with lower fees, American Express tightened contract provisions with merchants to stop what it called discrimination against its cards. 
American Express, which accounts for about 26 percent of all U.S. credit card transactions, said in legal papers that merchant fees and anti-steering measures are essential to compete with Visa and MasterCard, which are offered by most banks and are so ubiquitous that it is almost ""inevitable"" that a bank customer will be issued one of those cards.
Writing for the court's majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said in the ""two-sided"" market for credit card transactions, the states failed to show that the American Express system reduced the number of transactions or increased costs beyond a competitive level. 
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer read his dissent from the bench, underscoring the seriousness of the issue. Antitrust laws protect the economy from monopolies, Breyer said.
""I fear that today's decision will weaken this protection by departing from basic, established antitrust principles,"" Breyer added.
The decision could make it harder to find antitrust violations in markets in which businesses cater to two groups at the same time, in this case merchants and cardholders. That dynamic is common in other industries such as advertising and internet commerce, for example an online reservation platform used by both diners and restaurants.
The legal issue centered on how courts find antitrust violations where limits on competition for one side might offer benefits for the other. 
The case began in 2010 when the U.S. Justice Department, joined by the states, sued American Express claiming the anti-steering contract requirements prevent merchants from using competition to try to keep credit card fees from increasing.
Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2010 by agreeing to change their rules. 

The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>",Advent takes over GE distributed power unit for $3.25 billion,"By Alwyn Scott and Arno Schuetze
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. buyout group Advent agreed to buy  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) distributed power unit for $3.25 billion, the companies said on Monday, marking GE's exit from a growing segment of the power business.
GE had put the unit, which makes Jenbacher and Waukesha brand reciprocating gas engines, up for sale as part of a three-year plan to exit about $20 billion in industrial assets. GE hopes to book as much as $10 billion in such proceeds this year.
The sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, highlights the growing demand for reciprocating engines by utilities, which pair them with wind and solar generators. Because the engines start quickly, they can fill in when wind and sun falter and then be shut off when not needed, conserving fuel. Large power turbines cannot start as quickly and so must be kept spinning at partial power even when wind or solar electricity supplies are ample.
""Distributed Power is a terrific asset,"" said Ranjan Sen, managing partner at Advent International. ""The business has significant growth potential on a global scale and talented employees all over the world.""
Advent plans to ""invest substantially"" in critical areas such as the product portfolio, service network and digitization, he said, to build up the company's market position. 
Advent prevailed against engine maker Cummins (N:CMI) in the final stages of the auction. Engine makers Kohler and Wartsila (HE:WRT1V) and investor KKR (N:KKR), had dropped out earlier, people close to the matter said.
The sale announcement did not have much effect on GE's stock, but ""checks the box on another divestiture-simplification action by (GE) CEO John Flannery,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
GE's stock was down 1.5 percent at $12.85 in mid-day trading in New York, in line with the broader market. 
Advent's purchase values the unit at about 11.2 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of just below $290 million, said a person close to the matter. Last year it posted revenue of $1.3 billion. 
Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, GE is aggressively cutting costs, selling units and strengthening its balance sheet under a new board and managers.
Selling the industrial gas engine business is expected to help streamline GE's $35 billion-a-year power division, whose profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply. 
Jenbacher and Waukesha engines range from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. One of GE's key customers is the German port city of Kiel, which is using 20 Jenbacher engines to create a 190 megawatt plant, replacing a coal-fired plant opened in 1970, GE said. 
The engines will supply heat and electricity to homes and buildings, with power supplemented by nearby wind turbines, GE said. The last of the Debaucher's was delivered in March and the old coal plant is due to shut down next year, GE said. 

Finland's Wartsila, which makes similar engines, dropped out of talks for the unit several weeks ago, as it did not see enough synergies to allow it to pay the mooted price of as much as $3.5 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Government's anti-business bias hurts UK economy: London finance chief,"By Huw Jones and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government's hostile attitude toward business is damaging the economy and companies will move overseas if they continue to be unfairly attacked for warning about the dangers from Brexit, the City of London's policy chief told Reuters.
The government's already strained relations with business further soured over the weekend after a senior minister accused companies of issuing ""completely inappropriate"" threats to pull out of the country over Brexit.
A day earlier the foreign minister Boris Johnson was quoted by the Daily Telegraph newspaper dismissing business leaders' concerns about the impact of Brexit and using foul language in a meeting with European Union diplomats.
Catherine McGuinness, the political leader of the City of London, the local government that administers Europe's biggest financial center, said the government's relationship with business is the worst since she started working in 1983.
She said the relations between business and politicians are even worse than when taxpayers were forced to spend more than 133 billion pounds ($176.65 billion) bailing out British banks at the height of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. 
""Some of the statements we've heard don't encourage you to think that we are an economy that welcomes business,"" McGuinness told Reuters in a restaurant near the Bank of England.
""Business is very frustrated that we are not making progress. Secondly there is a huge amount of uncertainty around, and thirdly, whenever they try to say anything, which they do with care, they are slapped down."" 
The souring in relations comes at a critical moment in the Brexit process where many large companies are deciding what operations they may have to move to the continent to ensure they can continue trading with the EU.
A series of companies with major operations in Britain, including Airbus, Siemens and BMW, have voiced concerns about the impact of Britain's departure from EU, saying a withdrawal without a deal would force them to reconsider their investments.
With only nine months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, little is yet clear about how trade will flow between the world's fifth largest economy and its biggest trading bloc.
The business minister Greg Clark on Monday attempted to distance himself from some of his colleagues by saying any company and industry that brings jobs to Britain is entitled to be listened to.
McGuinness said she was concerned that time is running out to secure an agreement and the probability that Britain exits the EU without having agreed a divorce deal is increasing. 
""You do get the feeling that the sand is running out of the hour glass rather quickly,"" she said. ""I feel there has been a lot of kicking cans down the road and we are coming up against the wall."" 
McGuinness also said she was concerned that the government will end up agreeing a trade deal only for goods, without properly addressing services.
This would help solve the thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland that could rekindle sectarian violence in the region, but would leave financial and other services out in the cold even though they make up about 80 percent of Britain's economic activity.
""I am worried that there is a possibility that they will put other parts of the economy above the big engine that the financial and related professional services represents,"" she said. 
McGuinness, who has traveled to China and the United States in the last year and will visit India soon, said Brexit has undermined Britain's reputation as a predictable place to do business, forcing the country to prove its value to businesses in a way that it didn't need to do before.

""They have seen Britain as a gateway to Europe and the pinnacle of success… I don't think we look particularly stable anymore,"" McGuinness said.

1570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Investors Cut Equities as Trade Complacency Gives Way to Anxiety,"(Bloomberg) -- For a while, it seemed like everyone was willing to see Donald Trump’s trade threats as “The Art of the Deal” -- negotiating tactics. Not any more.
Fidelity International and Thomas Miller Investments Ltd. have cut their equity holdings amid growing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Declines in global shares have accelerated as U.S. President Trump threatened tariffs on European cars and another $200 billion of Chinese goods, in addition to levies set to take effect next week.
“It may well be that everyone eventually comes to their senses and the rhetoric comes down a bit, but as investors we have to work on the basis of probability,” said Abi Oladimeji, chief investment officer at Thomas Miller, which has cut stocks and boosted holdings in cash and alternative assets recently. “Miscalculations can happen. In that scenario it’s hard to see how anything that approaches a full-blown trade war will not be damaging for economic prospects.”
The outbreak of a trade war -- a worst-case scenario still seen as unlikely -- would roil global markets. After decades under a free-trade regime, even the most veteran investors have little experience in dealing with the fallout from protectionism. China and the European Union warned that unilateral trade barriers could push the world into a recession.
For now, markets are still far from a meltdown, but losses are building. Major equity markets are all down on Monday, with Europe’s Stoxx 600 reaching levels not seen since late April.
“Europe is quite a cyclical market and quite an export-driven market, so more than some other areas, it’s quite susceptible to a slowdown in global economic growth,” said Toby Gibb, London-based client portfolio manager at Fidelity International, which oversaw $324.5 billion of as of March 31. “This sort of rhetoric is likely to continue over the summer at least up till U.S. mid-term elections.”
Fidelity has turned neutral on equities from overweight, and added to its cash and bond holdings, he said. Equity funds saw $13 billion of outflows globally in the week through June 20, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). said in a report, citing EPFR Global data.
While there are stocks that may do better amid rising trade tensions -- Gibb suggests some U.S. tech shares, where Oladimeji points to defensive sectors or U.S. producers that benefit from trade barriers -- both investors say stock losses will be broad-based.
And it’s not just trade. The U.S. is still set to continue tightening monetary policy. Economic data in Europe have disappointed this year, with a gauge of German business confidence resuming its decline this month in a sign the trade rhetoric is starting to affect companies.
Markets may be too used to political crises being resolved at the last minute or too confident that no reasonable politician would want a trade war, said Oladimeji at Thomas Miller.
“Investors may be at risk of being complacent,” he said. “The probability of it may be small, but the impact may be quite significant.”

The court left in place a September ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that went against the banks, which had challenged the 2015 award on multiple grounds.
Lawyers for Nomura and RBS could not immediately be reached for comment.
The award stemmed from a lawsuit brought against Nomura and RBS by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2011. The FHFA has acted as conservator of mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 takeover by the federal government after the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
The lawsuit was one of 18 brought by the FHFA that year over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
All the other lawsuits have been settled. The FHFA has recovered more than $23 billion from the settlements, including $5.5 billion from RBS in a different lawsuit, $5.83 billion from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in 2015 against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals.

She ruled that the offering documents for the securities did not correctly describe the underlying mortgages and ordered the banks to pay $806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another $33 million for costs and attorneys’ fees, subject to the outcome of their appeal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors have reached $96 million in settlements with the final five defendants in private U.S. litigation accusing banks of rigging a key interest rate benchmark in the global derivatives market, boosting the total payout to more than $500 million.
 BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) will each pay $33.5 million, Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will each pay $8.75 million, and brokerage ICAP (LON:NXGN) Capital Markets LLC will pay $11.5 million, according to filings on Friday night in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Upon receiving court approval, the settlements would increase the total recovered from 14 banks plus ICAP to $504.5 million. The defendants denied wrongdoing in agreeing to the preliminary settlements.
Several pension funds and municipalities had accused banks of conspiring to manipulate the benchmark known as ISDAfix for their own gain from at least 2009 to 2012, distorting part of the $532 trillion global derivatives market.
Companies and investors use ISDAfix to price swaps transactions, commercial real estate mortgages and structured debt securities.
Daniel Brockett, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a court filing said only about 12 antitrust class actions had approved settlements topping $500 million, assuming the latest accords are approved.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) $56.5 million payout was the largest in the ISDAfix case.
Several banks have settled similar allegations by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) accepting a $65 million fine on June 18.
The private litigation is among many lawsuits in the federal court in Manhattan accusing banks of conspiring to rig rate benchmarks, securities prices and commodities prices.

The case is Alaska Electrical Pension Fund et al v Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) NA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-07126.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is seeking private investors' help for a $40 billion upgrade of its rail network aimed at reducing logistics costs and boosting trade, Minster of Transport Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told Reuters on Monday. 
Lowering transport costs is crucial because exports account for two thirds of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
Thailand's transport system will ""place greater emphasis on rail,"" Arkhom said in an interview, adding the country had ""overly depended on roads and trucks."" 
""We are looking for more active participation of private investment (in rail),"" he said, while ruling out the privatization of operator State Railway of Thailand.
The projects include upgrading the network to dual-track rails. The government has already approved 123 billion baht ($3.7 billion) of such upgrades, with nine more worth 407 billion baht to be approved this year, Arkhom said. 
In addition, bidding for a 229 billion baht, 220-kilometre (km) high-speed rail project linking three airports, including the country's main Suvarnabhumi airport, will take place in November.
""Construction and operation is open to the private sector,"" Arkhom said of this project, adding Chinese, Japanese and European companies had expressed interest. 
Thai companies including energy giant PTT Pcl (BK:PTT), urban rail operator, BTS Group Holdings (BK:BTS) and construction company, CK Karnchang Pcl (BK:CK) are also interested.
The government will invest in the project's civil work, Arkhom said. 
Another ambitious plan, forged with China, is a 179 billion baht high-speed rail link stretching some 355 km to connect central and northeastern Thailand with Laos. 
Arkhom said bidding for this project would take place before the end of the year and foreign companies could participate in construction if they were part of a Thai joint venture.
Construction of the first phase began last year after the Thai military government, which came to power in a coup in 2014, intervened and cleared legal hurdles.
The government signed two contracts last year worth $157 million with Chinese state enterprises for engineering and design work, which are expected to be delivered this month, Arkhom said.
Another project, this time with Japan, is a 672-km railway linking central and northern Thailand. Bidding on the 420 billion baht plan is expected to begin in 2020.

1591,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Harley-Davidson warns European tariffs will cause a 'tremendous cost increase',"""Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers’ businesses."" the company  said in a regulatory filing.
""Therefore, Harley-Davidson will not raise its manufacturer’s suggested retail prices or wholesale prices to its dealers to cover the costs of the retaliatory tariffs. In the near-term, the company will bear the significant impact resulting from these tariffs.
Harley-Davidson exported 390,619 motorcycles to Europe in 2017,  it said in its annual report, easily outpacing the 288,802 it sold in the United States for the same year.
Because of the importance of European sales, the company expects the tariffs to have an impact of approximately $30 million to $45 million in 2018, and rising to $90 to $100 million on a full-year basis going forward. To help mitigate some of the costs, the company also said it ""will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to international facilities."" However, that could take up to 18 months to complete.
Shares of the company fell about 2.3% in early trading Monday following the filing.
Monday's news comes roughly a year into Harley-Davidson's ""The Journey"" program. Launched in 2017, the 10-year strategy is designed to return Harley-Davidson to is former glory by converting more riders, launching new motorcycles, and consolidating some of its manufacturing locations.
Shares of Harley-Davidson are down more than 20% from their January highs as global fears of an all-out trade war and their resulting  impact on commodity prices for raw metals weigh on the stock's price."

The French government and the European planemaker have been working to salvage the contract since a visit by Macron to China in January, when he said China would buy 184 Airbus A320 narrow-body jets, an order worth $18 billion at list prices.
Industry sources said Macron returned home empty handed after a diplomatic gaffe and some of his own separate comments upset Chinese officials. 
Macron sent his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to Beijing this weekend partly in a bid to move the negotiations forward.
At a joint news conference, Li said China had long been a large customer for Airbus aircraft, and noted their joint manufacturing facility in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. 
“I explained to Mr Prime minister that in recent years we have bought quite a lot of passenger aircraft, and there needs to be a period to digest this. In spite of this, we are still willing to strengthen cooperation with France’s Airbus,” Li said, adding China planned to buy lots of planes in 2018.
“We are willing to continue discussing the issue of buying Airbus aircraft and in due course to sign agreements to buy Airbus aircraft,"" Li added. 
Philippe said he was glad China had expressed its willingness to soon firm up its purchase commitment.

State-controlled China Eastern is seeking 150 single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 or the competing Boeing (N:BA) 737, industry sources have said. They also say China's ICBC Financial Leasing has expressed interest in placing an Airbus order.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Russian central bank may need extra 100 billion roubles for 'bad bank' - sources,"By Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank may need to provide another 100 billion roubles ($1.6 billion) for a planned ""bad bank"", adding to the more than $40 billion already spent on three banking bailouts, two sources familiar with discussions said. 
Russia had to rescue three of the country's biggest private banks in the second half of 2017, including Otkritie, once the country's largest private lender, as well as B&N and Promsvyasbank. It has also shut hundreds of smaller banks as part of a wider clean-up of the finance sector over the past few years.
The banking sector's troubles have been blamed partly on excessive M&A activity by the banks and their former owners.
The central bank has decided to split the three banks' assets into ""good"" and ""bad"" and shift their non-performing assets to the planned ""bad bank"", which would have assets of 2.1 trillion roubles. 
The plan is for the bad bank to sell off those assets within three to five years.
A source close to the central bank said that Trust Bank, part of the Otkritie banking group, which will be used to establish the bad bank, will need more than 100 billion roubles in extra funds. 
Rost, part of B&N banking group, will be merged with Trust as part of the creation of the bad bank. 
The second source, close to Otkritie, said that the final amount of the additional funds is yet to be decided, but confirmed it would exceed 100 billion roubles. Most of this will be used to prop up Trust's liquidity and partly - to boost its capital, the second source said. 
""Almost a year has passed (since the central bank started big bailouts), the quality of the assets has worsened, value of the some has fallen as new problems have emerged,"" the source close to Otkritie said, explaining the need for the fresh funds. 
Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina told Reuters this month the bank had injected 758.3 billion roubles to boost the capital of Otkritie, B&N and Promsvyazbank, while another 1.86 trillion roubles were provided for deposits. 
The sources did not say how support would be split between the Trust's liquidity and capital. The source close to Otkritie said that the funds to support the capital could be partly taken from the cash provided by the central bank to Otkritie, a process which began last year. 
Otkritie declined to comment. The central bank did not respond to a Reuters request to comment. 
The Russian central bank has said that the bailout process, which requires printing fresh cash, will not affect its monetary policy as the funds are distributed via a specially established Fund for Consolidation of Banking Sector.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Swiss private bank UBP hires top banker to attract more U.S. clients,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Union Bancaire Privee (UBP) aims to rebuild its business with U.S. clients following a big tax settlement two years ago, hiring a top banker to oversee a unit that specializes in managing investments for U.S. residents and citizens.
The group on Monday named Deepak Soni to head its subsidiary UBP Investment Advisors. Among other things, he will oversee the addition of a new Zurich branch, UBP said in a statement.
Soni, who previously managed bank Vontobel's (S:VONN) advisory for U.S. clients, has been tasked with growing the bank's business managing wealthy Americans' assets. 
Over the next three years, the group wants to grow its business for U.S. clients to some 2 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion) of managed assets, a spokesman said, declining to quantify the current size.
""The United States is the world's biggest wealth management market today and is therefore a priority market for UBP,"" private banking head Michel Longhini said in a statement. 
""We are very pleased to have hired Deepak Soni.""
UBP group assets under management totaled 125.3 billion Swiss francs at the end of last year.
UBP was among Swiss banks that came under fire from U.S. authorities starting in 2008 for allegedly helping wealthy Americans dodge taxes.
The Geneva-based bank reached a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2016, paying over $187 million to resolve potential issues related to undeclared accounts and efforts to help Americans conceal income and assets. 
At the time, the DOJ said the bank had held nearly 3,000 U.S.-related accounts since mid-2008 when factoring in acquisitions it made over the period, managing some $4.9 billion for U.S. clients at its peak.
Switzerland, the world's largest center for offshore wealth, has since introduced largely automatic information-sharing on tax matters between many countries as it curtails banking secrecy.
Soni assumed his role on June 1.

The blue-chip Dow futures lost slid 209 points, or 0.85%, by 6:43AM ET (10:43GMT), the S&P 500 futures fell 19 points, or 0.70%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 77 points, or 1.07%
On the back of Trump’s threat last Friday to impose a 20% tariff on vehicles imported from Europe, the President emphasized the need for other countries to remove their trade barriers or face retaliation.



Trump insisted via Twitter on Sunday that “all countries that have placed artificial trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country (must) remove those barriers and tariffs or be met with more than reciprocity.”
Adding fuel to the fire, President Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech and to block additional technology exports to China, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday evening, citing people familiar with the matter.
According to the report, the Treasury Department is drawing up rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology"".
Meanwhile, the National Security Council and the Commerce Department are also putting together plans for tighter export controls that will not allow ""industrially significant technology"" to be exported to China.
WSJ reported that the two measures are set to be announced by the end of the week and would be designed to counter Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” strategy, a program intended to make China a global leader in technology.
Outside of trade jitters, market participants face a slow session for economic data on Monday. The focus will be on new home sales for May, due at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT), although some attention will also be paid to the Chicago Fed national activity index for May and the Dallas Fed manufacturing business index for June.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, edged forward 0.13% to trade at 94.31 by 6:46AM ET (10:46GMT), hovering below an 11-month high of 95.22 reached in the previous week.
Meanwhile, oil prices traded lower on Monday, as energy investors continued to react to last week's decision by major producers to start pumping more crude to compensate for losses in global production.
International benchmark Brent futures lost $1.26, or 1.7%, at $74.06 by 6:48AM ET (10:48GMT) a barrel, while U.S. crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 11 cents, or 0.2%, at $68.47.
The drop came after both barrels had their best day since late 2016 on Friday, with gains of 3.4% and 4.6%, respectively, after OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed on a modest increase in production from next month, without announcing a clear target for the output increase. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, said on Saturday the move would translate into a nominal output rise of around 1 million barrels per day (bpd).
Elsewhere, European markets were under pressure as automakers and miners, seen among the sectors most at risk of a trade war, led losses. Data released on Monday also showed that German business confidence ebbed in June to its lowest in more than a year, suggesting the mood among company executives in Europe's biggest economy is darkening as trade war tensions escalate.

The South Korean procurement agency Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said separately that it had decided to buy the P-8 Poseidon aircraft through the U.S. government foreign military sales program. 
Kang Hwan-seok, a DAPA spokesman, told a media briefing the decision was made after a comprehensive review of legal aspects, cost, schedule and performance.
Saab (ST:SAABb) and Airbus (PA:AIR) had also shown interest in meeting the government's needs with the Swordfish and C295 MPA models respectively, but the Boeing contract was ultimately awarded on a ""sole-source"" basis that did not require a competitive tender process.
South Korea said in February that it would procure from overseas new maritime patrol aircraft with stronger anti-submarine capabilities in order to better respond to the threat of North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 
The February decision came before relations between the two Koreas thawed rapidly this year, with United States and South Korea indefinitely suspending two military training exercises, after the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month. 
Boeing's (N:BA) P-8A Poseidon had been the likely candidate as its features such as its large payload and distance of flight more than clears South Korea's requirements, a military source with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier on Monday on condition of anonymity.
Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said it was not a ""bad choice,"" given Poseidon's features. 
""Even if South Korea and U.S. decided not to hold military drills this year, we have to maintain security until North Korea fully denuclearizes and we also needed to replace our old maritime patrol aircraft,"" Yang said. 

South Korea has an existing fleet of aging  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) P-3 Orions.

LONDON (Reuters) - The latest episode in a trade dispute between the United States and other major economies sent European shares further into a funk on Monday with benchmarks down 0.8 to 1.2 percent and autos, basic resources and tech stocks the worst hurt. 
A report that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block more tech exports to Beijing hit Asian stocks overnight and dented early European trading.
Europe's tech sector (SX8P), which is mainly composed of hardware firms more sensitive to trade barriers, fell 1.2 percent on the news which could herald higher costs for companies.
Chipmakers BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicro (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) were the biggest fallers, down 2.6 to 3.6 percent, while heavyweight software firms SAP and Micro Focus also dropped. 
The autos sector (SXAP), a key target for Trump who said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent, was the worst hit. It fell 1.4 percent, set for its seventh straight day of losses. 
Analysts have downgraded their expectations for global autos stocks earnings worldwide as the trade war deepened over the past weeks. 
Bank stocks (SX7P), highly sensitive to economic turmoil, were the worst-performing with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) bottom of the DAX while HSBC (L:HSBA), Santander (MC:SAN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) led Europe-wide falls.
Overall, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) declined 0.7 percent while Germany's exporter- and autos-heavy index fell 0.9 percent. An Ifo survey reading showing that Germany's business morale fell in June added extra pressure on the DAX.
Overall investors have grown more risk-averse due to increasing tensions over trade, driving some to reconsider their pro-cyclical positioning. 
""We recommend buying into trade-newsflow-driven market weakness as the stronger growth is what should ultimately prevail,"" said JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka. 
He added however that further trade war escalation could jeopardize his positive position on the DAX, on cyclicals and exporters.
Industrials, which need unfettered access to markets, were also selling off. Airbus (PA:AIR), ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) were among biggest drags on the STOXX.
Italian cable maker  Prysmian  (MI:PRY) fell 4.3 percent, the biggest loser on the STOXX, at the open after it cut its guidance due to additional expected costs related to issues with its UK WesternLink undersea cable project.
Among stand-out gainers, Danish medical equipment maker Ambu (CO:AMBUb) jumped 6.5 percent to the top of the STOXX after JP Morgan started coverage of it with an ""overweight"" rating. 
Telenet (BR:TNET) also gained 5 percent after starting a 300 million euro share buyback program.
British mid-cap workspace group IWG (L:IWG) rose 5.2 percent after confirming it received a possible cash offer from private equity firm Terra Firma and is evaluating it.

In small-cap UK stocks, Britain's biggest real estate firm Countrywide (L:CWD) sank 23.4 percent after a profit warning, the latest in a host of UK companies to signal results would be hit by adverse market conditions.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2018 04:37AM ET</span>","Trade worries hit world stocks, oil gives back gains","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares fell on Monday, dented by worries over a worsening trade dispute between the United States and other major economies, while oil prices gave up some of the gains made after major exporters agreed a modest production increase.
The Wall Street Journal said U.S. President Donald Trump planned to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China.
The report hit Asian stocks overnight and in London the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down over half a percent in morning trade.
S&P500 mini futures fell as much as 0.6 percent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.95 percent to 6-1/2-month lows. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.8 percent.
Taking a particular hit on the trade tensions was the European autos sector, falling 1.4 percent and set for its seventh straight day of losses after Trump said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent.
MSCI's All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 in morning trade in Europe.
As the threat of a full-blown trade war has grown, the gauge has fallen in five of the last six weeks. Last week it fell one percent - its biggest weekly drop in three months.
""We suspect the Trump team will push ahead with these policies (which will elicit reciprocal tariffs from China and the EU) until U.S. equities start to crumble and polls move against Trump,"" wrote ING strategists in a research note.
A spread between approval and disapproval ratings of the U.S. President had reached its narrowest since March 2017, they noted.
Chinese shares were among the biggest losers, falling 1.27 percent and tumbling 3.7 percent last week, as Trump threatened to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs.
Policymakers in China moved fast to temper any potential economic drag from the dispute, as its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points.
That reduction in reserve requirements, the third this year, had been widely anticipated by investors and is aimed at accelerating the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spurring lending for smaller firms.
Despite the move, the CSI300 Index of mainland Chinese shares lost 0.8 percent, edging near the one-year low it touched on Friday.
The index of global auto manufacturers fell 0.7 percent. It lost 4.7 percent last week. 
Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on Friday on all imports of EU-assembled cars, a month after his administration launched an investigation into whether auto imports posed a national security threat.
A senior European Commission official said on Saturday that the European Union would respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc. 
Investors and traders are worried that threats of higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures could derail a rare period of synchronized global growth.
SLIPPERY OIL
Oil shed some of the gains posted on Friday after OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed a modest increase in production from next month.
They did not however announce a clear target for the output hike, leaving traders guessing how much more will actually be pumped.
OPEC and non-OPEC said in a statement they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. 
""Saturday's OPEC+ press conference provided more clarity on the decision to increase production, with guidance for a full 1 million bpd ramp-up in 2H18,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note on Sunday.
""This is a larger increase than presented Friday although the goal remains to stabilize inventories, not generate a surplus.""
U.S. crude futures traded at $68.64 per barrel, up 0.1 percent for the day after Friday's 4.6 percent rally.
International benchmark Brent fell 1.2 percent, however, to $74.61 per barrel, giving up nearly half of its gains made on Friday.
In the currency market the euro trade flat, having retreated in early trade.
German business confidence deteriorated in June, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting the mood among company executives in Europe's biggest economy was darkening in light of the threat of a global trade war.
The dollar fell nearly half a percent to 109.48 yen, hitting its lowest levels in two weeks as the Japanese currency firmed on concerns about the global trade frictions.
The Turkish lira gained up to 1.6 percent on expectations of a stable government after Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in presidential and parliamentary polls.
But his victory kept alive worries about inflation and the central bank's independence given recent comments suggesting he wanted to take greater control of monetary policy.
The lira traded at 4.59 to the dollar, up 1.7 percent from 4.6625 at the end of last week. 
Bitcoin steadied after hitting seven-month lows during the weekend as the security of cryptocurrency exchange operators came under more scrutiny. The digital currency fell as low as $5,780 overnight and last stood at $6,155 .

Rasmus Jarlov was appointed by Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on Thursday, after his predecessor Brian Mikkelsen stepped down for a private sector job.
""Danske Bank's money laundering in Estonia is a disgrace and a scandal,"" he said in a tweet late on Sunday. 
""I do not yet have an overview of what options I have as minister but I can guarantee I will not hold my hand over them.""
Major flaws in the Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) money laundering controls in Estonia made it possible for its branch there to be used for criminal activity, and the bank reacted too slowly when it was made aware of the weaknesses, Denmark's Financial Supervisory Authority said last month.
Danske Bank has launched its own investigation into the Estonia case and will present its findings in the autumn.
The investigation has so far shown the problems in the Estonian branch were bigger than the bank first thought, chief executive Thomas Borgen said in an interview with broadcaster DR, aired late on Sunday.
Jarlov will be questioned about the authorities' response to the case at an open meeting in the Danish parliament's business committee later on Monday.

Danske Bank did no immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling party has set off a new flurry of changes to the leadership of state-controlled companies, putting investors off a stock exchange that beat all emerging markets last year.
The CEOs at nine companies have been changed this year, hitting their share prices and adding to other factors driving the Warsaw Stock Exchange WIG20 (WIG20) down 18 percent in dollar terms after last year's 53 percent rise.
Around 20 senior managers have also been shifted since December, amid signs of infighting within the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party.
The absence from public life since April of its leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski due to health problems has added to the uncertainty. Kaczynski is Poland's political arbiter and author of interventionist policies criticized by the European Union.
The changes have taken place under Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, appointed by PiS in December to try to ease strains with Brussels over the party's judicial reforms.
Morawiecki's background running a bank owned by a foreign firm made some investors think he would sympathize with their position more than his PiS peers. Now they are not so sure.
""Investors do not know what the strategy is,"" said Marcin Szortyka, head of equities at NN Investment Partners TFI, one of the top five investment funds in Poland, citing uncertainty over potential banking sector mergers, the future of fuel companies and whether a nuclear power plant would be built.
Poland is the biggest beneficiary of EU funds and the EU has threatened to cut funding in its next budget round unless Morawiecki can convince them by late June that the government is not threatening judicial independence.
A separate EU plan to divert some funding from northern European states such as Poland to southern ones tackling a refugee crisis has further clouded the outlook.
Against this challenging backdrop, some investors say the corporate changes are a step too far. 
""The market is already complicated enough without that,"" said Tim Love, investment director of emerging market equities at global asset management company GAM.

""MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS""
In Poland, the state is able to control listed companies even where it does not hold a majority stake, giving it potential sway over 23 stocks on the bourse, 12 of which make up more than 70 percent of the blue chip index.
Five of the latest CEO removals have been at blue chips and there has been little explanation of the moves from either the government or the firms themselves, raising questions over policy and the future of other company chiefs. 
PiS had already swept aside the vast majority of appointees of the previous, centrist Civic Platform government at state firms since its return to power in 2015 after an eight-year gap. Personnel changes slowed last year but have now picked up again.
The twists and turns in the share price of refinery PKN Orlen (WA:PKN) illustrate the confusion this has caused.
CEO Wojciech Jasinski lost his job in February, surprising observers since he was known as an ally of Kaczynski.
Two government sources said his refusal to fire colleagues associated with Civic Platform had played a role, as had his reluctance to join a project to build a nuclear power plant.
""Sometimes, changes in managements of state-owned companies are being made in the face of more important matters,"" said one source, referring to government arguments the nuclear plant will create jobs, reduce emissions and cut the risk of blackouts.
The stock surged 24 percent in 2017 but lost 21 percent after Jasinski's replacement with Daniel Obajtek, who increased the amount of money invested in struggling coal miner PGG in his previous job heading utility Energa (WA:ENGP).
Earlier this month, PKN shares rebounded when the prime minister took control of the refinery, and another, Lotos (WA:LTSP), from the energy minister. One analyst suggested costly involvement in the nuclear plant was now less likely and a linkup with Lotos to create a strong European player would accelerate.
Since then, PKN's stock has dropped again with the revival of uncertainty, and, with it, fears over future cash flow. Neither the company nor the prime minister's office were immediately available to comment on the changes in the board.
MORAWIECKI
As finance minister since 2016, Morawiecki has overseen strong economic growth, 4.6 percent in 2017, and last year's stellar rise in the Warsaw index, due in part because Poland did not enact a plan to impose losses on banks over mortgages in Swiss francs which hurt Poles when the zloty currency weakened.
Another reason was a revival in coal prices, which relieved pressure on utilities told to invest in Poland's ailing mines.
Morawiecki has returned some banks to state control, suggested private capital is too weak and cautious and said he will prioritize domestic capital. Questions raised for investors by these statements have been compounded by the CEO reshuffle.
Production problems had already pressured copper miner KGHM (WA:KGH) since the last quarter of 2017, but its shares have dropped around 16 percent since Radoslaw Domagalski-Labedzki was fired as CEO on March 10.
It took over three months to find his replacement, leaving potential sales of foreign assets uncertain in what an energy ministry source said was a fight between various factions in PiS.
""There are three or maybe even four groups involved in this,"" he said. The energy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sebastian Buczek, CEO of Quercus TFI investment fund said the WSE's rise last year was fueled by foreign investors who had now moved on. ""There are markets that are more interesting,"" he said, ""where fewer unexpected things happen.""
SILVER LINING?
Other shares that have fallen since their chief executives left companies this year include  Alior Bank  (WA:ALRR), coal miner Bogdanka (WA:LWBP), real estate company PHN (WA:PHN) and construction company Polimex-Mostostal (WA:PXMP).
Shareholders are already concerned by the government's use of companies to fund favoured investments.
""An individual investor does not necessarily invest in Tauron (WA:TPE) or Enea (WA:ENAE) shares to take care of the energy security of the country,"" Grzegorz Zielinski, Poland director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, told Reuters, referring to the ulilities' investments in coal mines.
The CEO changes are far from the only factor that has weighed against Polish shares and some see a silver lining in the clouds over the Warsaw bourse.
Swiss bank UBS predicts a revival later this year, citing cheaper valuations, forecast GDP growth of 4.3 percent for 2018 and a budget deficit it expects to be just 0.6 percent of GDP.
""A weak stock market is not a problem as such for Polish macro,"" said Geoff Dennis, Head of Global Emerging Markets Equity Strategy at UBS Securities, adding that there was little risk to Warsaw's position in global equity market indices although consumer spending or investment could suffer.
Most emerging markets have declined this year, weighing on Poland along with weakness in the zloty currency and diminishing prospects for rate hikes that have pressured bank shares.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange now has one of the lowest valuations among markets included on the MSCI Emerging Markets index (MSCIEF), which rose from $1,160 at the end of December to $1,280 in January before falling back to $1,090.
The blue-chip WIG20 index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.99 and the broader index is 11.15, putting it toward the bottom of the index, just ahead of Hungary, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Russia and Turkey.

A phone call to the SEC was connected to an answering machine after business hours in the United States, and an email asking for comment did not receive an immediate reply. 
Toshiba's 2015 accounting scandal uncovered widespread accounting errors at the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate going back to around 2008. 
The scandal led the company to recognize huge cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, and forced the conglomerate to sell its prized memory chip unit for $18 billion.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 11:59PM ET</span>",Uber battles to keep London license in court appeal,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber goes to court on Monday to overturn a decision stripping it of its license in London after being ruled unfit to run a taxi service in its most important European market. 
Regulator Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last September by refusing to renew its license, citing failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and to background checks on drivers.
Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BlackRock and which is valued at over $70 billion, has faced protests, bans and restrictions around the world as it challenges traditional operators and angers some unions.
In London, the firm has since made several changes to its business model since losing its license, including the introduction of 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to the city's police.
It has also changed its senior management and apologized for mistakes.
""I know we got things wrong and that we have more work to do. I promise Londoners we will keep listening and improving as Uber moves forward in a new direction,"" UK General Manager Tom Elvidge, who will give evidence in court, said in May. 
The appeal is due to be heard at Westminster Magistrates' Court over three days and witnesses will also include Uber's UK Chairman Laurel Powers-Freeling, UK Head of Cities Fred Jones and TfL's Interim Director of Licensing Helen Chapman.
After its application for a five-year license was rejected last year by TfL, the company is now seeking an 18-month one to prove to the authorities that it has reformed. 
Judge Emma Arbuthnot may take weeks before making her decision, which is likely to be subject to further appeal by the losing side, meaning the whole legal process could take years.
In the meantime, Uber can continue to operate in the city.
At stake for the U.S. firm is one of its most crucial foreign markets. Of its roughly 50,000 drivers in Britain, around 40,000 are in London.
Since September's TfL decision, the firm has also been stripped of its license by the southern coastal city of Brighton, in a decision which it is appealing, and the northern city of York. 

It has however gained new licenses in Sheffield, Cambridge, Nottingham and Leicester.

The People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) announcement that it would cut the required reserved ratio (RRR) by 0.5% caught some attention.
The PBoC could unlock about 700 billion yuan (US$108 billion) of liquidity by cutting the RRR, which would become effective on July 5, according to the central banks’ website.
The move was widely anticipated as China said last week that it would use monetary policy tools, including cutting reserve ratios for some banks, to boost credit supply to smaller companies.
Analysts expect the bank to further ease policy to help cope with a slowing economy, reports on Monday suggested.
""While the PBOC reiterated its neutral stance, we think that the move is one step further toward more accommodative monetary policy, which is only fitting given softening growth and mounting trade tensions,"" Wei Yao, China economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, wrote in a note. 
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Componentt were both up 0.1% following the news. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3%.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering to declare China’s investment in U.S. technologies companies a threat to economic and national security, according to reports on Monday that cited eight people familiar with the plans.
The reports further noted U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would suggest administering the law in a report scheduled to be released on June 29.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.3% lower in morning trade as the yen advanced, while South Korea’s KOSPI also fell 0.3%.
A senior U.S. defence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that the U.S. would soon request North Korea a timeline with “specific asks” to follow up North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s promise to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Bombardier and Unifor, the union representing more than 2,100 production and office workers, had reached a tentative deal just hours the strike deadline on Saturday. The union members ratified the agreement on Sunday, Bombardier said in a statement.
Unifor had previously said its members were looking for a three-year contract with greater job security on the company's strong-selling Global 7500 business jet, among other demands.
The long-range jet, which is to enter service this year, is a critical part of Bombardier's strategy to grow business aircraft revenues to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017.
""The agreements we have reached are good for our employees as well as the future of aerospace manufacturing in Ontario,"" said Graham Kelly, vice president, Global Operations and Toronto Site.
Union workers at Bombardier's Downsview plant in Canada's largest city Toronto assemble several large-cabin business jets, along with the Q400 turboprops. 
The union talks follow Bombardier's May announcement that it had agreed to sell the sprawling Downsview site, the company's largest land asset, to a Canadian pension fund for about $635 million.

Bombardier will continue to operate from Downsview for a period of up to three years, with two optional one-year extension periods.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Supercharged telecom sector could become investor favorite,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An overhauled telecommunications sector featuring most of the so-called FANG stocks could debut as Wall Street's hottest bet when it kicks off in September, boosted by a rising wave of media and television acquisitions. 
Long viewed as stodgy stocks for dividend-oriented investors, the telecom services sector (SPLRCL) will be renamed communications services and supercharged with the addition of Facebook (O:FB), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) - three of the four FANGs, along with Amazon - as well as other companies that have driven the stock market to record highs in recent years. 
The changes are part of the largest-ever shakeup of the stock market's broad business categories.
In total, 14 S&P 500 companies, including Netflix, will shift from the consumer discretionary sector into communications, joining AT&T,  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ) and  CenturyLink  (N:CTL) in the biggest shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, since it was created in 1999. Five S&P 500 companies will switch from technology to communications. 
The new sector will also include Walt  Disney  (N:DIS), Comcast (O:CMCSA) and other entertainment and media companies scrambling to consolidate and fend off competition from newcomers Netflix and Alphabet, which produce content and sell it directly to consumers. 
The floodgates for such deals were sprung open this month by a legal ruling giving AT&T (N:T) the go-ahead to buy Time Warner for $85 billion.
""Among all of the sector groups, this is going to be the most dynamic,"" predicted Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""You will see a lot of deal activity in the coming months, and it will be an awakening for anyone who is not on top of it.""
Amazon.com (O:AMZN), the fourth FANG stock, will stay in consumer discretionary and represent nearly a third of that sector.

For graphic on Future Communications Sector click https://reut.rs/2K2y22w
Classifying companies within 11 major sectors and several sub-sectors, GICS is closely followed by sector analysts and investors. Its overhaul, which has yet to be finalized, aims to reflect the evolution of the media, telecommunications and Internet industries.
Getting a head start on the September revamp, State Street Global Advisors on Tuesday launched https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180619005812/en/State-Street-Global-Advisors-Launches-Communication-Services the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund , benchmarked to the sector's future configuration.
Reflecting Wall Street's willingness to pay top dollar for companies like Alphabet, Netflix and Activision Blizzard (O:ATVI), the newly constituted communications sector would trade at 19 times expected earnings, nearly double the sector's current multiple, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Earnings of the newly constituted communications sector are expected to jump 23 percent in the final quarter of 2018, compared with an estimated 12 percent increase under the sector's current configuration.

For graphic on Forward P/E of Newly Configured Sectors click https://reut.rs/2JX2sHD
Over the past five years, the telecommunications sector has had a total return of just 16 percent, including dividends. Under its new configuration, it would have had a total return of 110 percent and outperformed the S&P 500's 85 percent return, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) equity strategist Patrick Palfrey.
Media, television and wireless companies, all of which will become part of the Communications sector, see buying content producers as a way to add revenue. 
Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) has surged 20 percent since June 13, when Comcast offered $65 billion for its media assets, outbidding an offer from Walt Disney, which responded on Tuesday by raising its bid to $71 billion.
Sprint (N:S), T-Mobile (O:TMUS), Viacom (O:VIAB), CBS (N:CBS), Dish Network (O:DISH) and Discovery (O:DISCA) have risen between 6 percent and 34 percent in June.
Even if M&A speculation subsides before the GICS changes take effect, the addition of most of the FANGs and several other high-growth former tech stocks will make the communications sector attractive, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 

""Interest in the sector and the individual names is not going to dissipate,"" James said.

The policy makers sought to reassure foreign businesses in China amid fears that the Beijing government would retaliate for U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods by harassing American firms or depriving them of commercial opportunities, the Hong Kong-based newspaper reported, citing ""two Chinese government sources."" The option of targeting these business ""has never been on the cards,"" according to one of the people.
President Xi Jinping met with executives of overseas firms on Thursday, SCMP said.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). President David Solomon,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). Chairman David Abney and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla were among top executives at the meeting, according to the newspaper.
Read about how the tariffs may affect China’s economy.
The meeting came amid signs that a trade spat between the world’s two largest economies is escalating. Last week, Trump identified $200 billion in Chinese imports for additional tariffs of 10 percent -- with another $200 billion after that if Beijing retaliates. He’s already announced tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China, starting July 6 with an initial $34 billion worth of imports. China had said it’s ""fully prepared"" to respond.
Xi’s promises that China’s market would remain open sent ""a very clear message from the top leadership"" that U.S. companies were still welcome, the newspaper cited one of the people as saying."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Some small investors who want to give a piece of their minds to big tech company directors are losing their only chance: many board members are skipping annual shareholder meetings. Companies that hold meetings online have some of the worst records for attendance.
A large portion of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) directors have not attended annual shareholder meetings in recent years, company records and securities filings show, in some cases in growing numbers.
Recent high-profile no-shows at the meetings - which are often the only chance ""mom-and-pop"" retail investors get to ask directors questions - include Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page and Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The companies declined to discuss the absences in detail.
While big asset managers can get access to directors, shareholder activists and corporate governance experts say the empty seats at annual meetings mean small investors and campaigners challenging directors to make corporate changes may not get to engage with boards.
""If they're not hearing it, they can't address it and they can't respond,"" said Christine Jantz, chief investment officer of NorthStar Asset Management.
Facebook, for example, might have dealt better with its data privacy scandal earlier this year if its full board had taken more notice of content oversight and governance issues that were discussed at its most recent annual meetings, said Jantz. 
Only four of eight directors attended Facebook's annual meeting in 2017, according to the company's proxy filings. A transcript shows five of nine directors attended its May 31 annual meeting this year and that Thiel was not present.
A Facebook spokeswoman declined comment, but noted that Jeffrey Zients, who joined Facebook's board after the meeting, replacing a departing director, did attend this year.
Alphabet, the parent of search-engine leader Google, has even lower numbers. Four of 11 directors attended its June 6 annual meeting, according to a spokeswoman. CEO Page was absent, a transcript of the event shows. Four directors also attended last year's meeting. The average since 2006 is five directors.
""You would think that the board members would want to be there and fully aware of these issues,"" said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital, which at this year's meeting called for Alphabet to report on its efforts to address political propaganda and other problematic material on Google's YouTube service, and to report on risks related to pay differences between male and female employees.
ONLINE 'GREAT ENABLER'
The National Association of Corporate Directors and many governance consultants recommend directors attend annual meetings.
Aside from Alphabet and Facebook, almost all directors of top U.S. businesses attend their annual meetings, according to the most recent proxies of the 20 largest companies in the S&P 500 Index.
Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) all had strong director attendance this year, according to transcripts and spokespeople. Tech leaders Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) also had good director attendance.
On the other end of the scale, some other tech firms are taking to cyber space, where director absences are less noticeable. 
Only two of Netflix's 11 directors, including CEO Reed Hastings, attended its June 6 online-only annual meeting, a company web page shows. A third director attended in 2017, when the meeting was held in person.
The online format is a ""great enabler"" for directors inclined to skip the meetings, said John Chevedden, an activist investor who frequently files shareholder rights proposals.
A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on the attendance but said: ""We approach board practices with a high level of transparency."" In response to a complaint from Chevedden, Netflix said its ""virtual"" meeting was more accessible to stockholders.

Of nine Twitter directors, only CEO Jack Dorsey was identified as present at its meeting on May 30, also held only online. Two Twitter directors attended last year's event, down from six in 2016 and five in 2015, filings show. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures and said the online format was aimed at boosting stockholder participation.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Etihad tells pilots they can join rival Emirates on secondment,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways has told its pilots they can join rival Emirates on a temporary basis for two years, according to an internal Etihad email seen by Reuters, as the downsizing of the Abu Dhabi carrier's operations helps fill a pilot shortage for Dubai's Emirates.
Etihad, which last week reported a $1.5 billion annual loss, has been overhauling its business since 2016, replacing its top executive, dropping unprofitable routes and shrinking its fleet.
The agreement is also likely to help Emirates, where a pilot shortage forced it to cancel some flights this summer. Management had said the shortage was a short-term issue.
In the email, Etihad said pilots who join Emirates on a two-year secondment would be placed on a leave of absence, retain seniority at Etihad, and receive their salary and full benefits from the Dubai airline. 
Pilots were asked in the email to register a non-binding expression of interest and told that Emirates' recruitment team would meet with pilots at Etihad's offices.
Two sources separately told Reuters that Etihad had emailed staff announcing the agreement with Emirates.
An Etihad spokesman told Reuters secondment programs were common practice among airlines, enabling the effective management of pilot resources. 
""This is something Etihad Airways has done for several years with partner airlines around the world,"" the spokesman said.
An Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters the airline was ""working with Etihad on a secondment program for some of their pilots.""
It was not immediately clear how many pilots would be offered temporary employment at Emirates and the email stated that any pilots applying for the secondment would need to complete Emirates' training program.
Etihad employs 2,200 pilots, according to the airline spokesman. Reuters reported in January that Etihad had offered up to 18 months unpaid leave to pilots.
Emirates and Etihad have been exploring closer ties and signed a security pact in January, the first agreement between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) based airlines. Emirates has since said that a closer relationship was not about a merger.
Emirates and Etihad, backed by their state owners, have competed developing global networks from their respective hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi that are just 128 kilometers apart.

Emirates is owned by the government of Dubai, and Etihad is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Fox spirits and demons: China's tech giants splash out in cartoon arms race,"By Pei Li, Anita Li and Adam Jourdan
HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Growing up in the Chinese port city of Dalian in the 1990s, Zhang Hongchang spent hours immersed in Japanese cartoons like Dragon Ball and Naruto.
China's home-grown cartoons paled in comparison to the Japanese anime series on television and in comic books that captured the imaginations of Zhang and his generation.
Today, Zhang is one of China's hottest cartoonists and at the forefront of a new wave of Chinese animation that is being driven by the country's technology and internet giants. His latest hit comic – which stars a high school student who is also a Taoist priest with secret super powers - has been viewed 160 million times online.
China's tech firms are engaged in a cartoon arms race to develop or buy Chinese characters in an animation market expected to hit 216 billion yuan ($33.22 billion) by 2020, according to the EntGroup consultancy, trying to emulate the success of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) ensemble, which ranges from Mickey Mouse to Iron Man.
A key to that effort, has been the development of artists like Zhang.
""When I started, I was copying Japanese cartoons, but slowly I got my own style,"" Zhang said in the Hangzhou studio where he draws comics that are made available to readers on a platform operated by the local gaming firm NetEase Inc (O:NTES). 
""I had to spend a lot time getting to understand the Chinese market and what Chinese comic readers wanted.""
Chinese tech giants like Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) and NetEase are trying to figure out the same thing. 
Part of the winning formula has been the use of traditional Chinese religious and cultural themes, and characters. That, and improved quality in terms of art and storytelling, helped China's comic and animation market reach 150 billion yuan last year, according to EntGroup's estimates.
China still lags behind the Japanese and American markets, but is catching up. Japan is the top producer of animation, while the United States dominates in terms of sales, taking a nearly 40 percent share of the global industry, estimated at $220 billion in 2016, according to a report from Research & Markets. China had around 8 percent that year.
For Chinese companies, the development of compelling series and characters could also open up new business opportunities that companies like Disney have exploited, like branded theme parks, games, movies, TV shows, lunch boxes and clothes.
""To make it work there have to be good stories, good production, and content that can resonate with consumers,"" said Xu Zhiwei, animation and comic copyright senior manager at Tencent in Beijing.
Tencent is already seeing some success that could help the firm maintain rapid growth and a high valuation.
The gaming-to-social media company bought up ""Fox Spirit Matchmaker"", which depicts romances between humans and demons, when it was a little-known comic, created by an artist called Xiao Xin. 
The comic has been developed into an animation series that's been viewed more than 3 billion times, Tencent told Reuters, making it one of the hottest hits on its video platform, which has over 60 million paying subscribers. 
Tushan Susu, the animation's main character, has been featured in a commercial for the fast food chain KFC (N:YUM) (N:YUMC). Tencent is now looking to create a television series and a video game using Fox Spirit characters. 
LOCAL HEROES 
China's tech giants play an outsized role in Chinese entertainment. Tencent, the search company Baidu, and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), the e-commerce giant, control most of the top online platforms from movies to sport, and are dominant in social media and online gaming. 
These firms are looking to latch on to a surging sub-culture being driven by a young generation with a taste for animation, called ""dongman"" in Chinese. This group is keen for more local-style heroes, according to industry executives.
They are also wealthier than their parents were, and have money to spend.
""Youngsters, especially the post-2000s, are very willing to spend money,"" Geng Danhao, senior vice president at Baidu's online streaming platform, iQiyi, said at an event in Beijing.
Zhang Tuo, a 21-year-old college student in Sichuan, said he had spent more than 7,000 yuan on comic-related merchandise, from plastic figurines to t-shirts. His favorites are local comics like Spiritpact and Monster List. Tao Jie, 20 a student in the southwestern city of Chengdu, said Chinese cartoons had improved in terms of story lines and animation technique. The use of local tales was also an attraction, he said. 
""A lot of the Chinese comic and animation are developed from online novels that I have already read. I like them because I'm already a fan of the stories,"" said Tao. 
That shift has been helped by supportive government policies to ensure that peak-time television slots are kept for domestic animation. 
The big tech firms are starting to spend, though not yet at the level of Disney, which bought Pixar Animation Studios for $7.6 billion, as well as Marvel Entertainment, and the Star Wars producer Lucasfilm Ltd for around $4 billion each. 
Tencent has invested in more than a dozen comic and animation companies since last year, according to public records, while its film arm launched a ""100 animations"" project to support domestic productions.
Baidu's iQiyi (O:IQ), is also splashing out on domestic comics, planning to spend 200 million yuan to sign Chinese artists and develop local characters, which comes on top of an earlier investment in 10 animation projects, the company said in May.
Alibaba and the news aggregator Toutiao have snapped up production companies and launched animation platforms on their own sites. NetEase signed a deal last year with Disney to create Marvel style superheroes, but with Chinese characteristics.
Luo Qiandan, marketing director of NetEase Comics, said the firm was using big data from its platform to analyze what comic consumers wanted and would feed this back to artists. 
It was also adopting other elements such as Chinese brush painting techniques and religious themes.
""Everybody is trying to use Chinese elements and Chinese style,"" she said.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",How a French solo trader made a $6.6 billion unauthorized bet,"By Julien Ponthus and Blandine Henault
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - A self-employed trader in France accumulated stock futures worth $6.6 billion in a single day, trading records show, raising questions among investors about how he could build up such a large position despite having only 20,000 euros in his account.
Financial industry safeguards have been tightened in the 10 years since rogue trader Jerome Kerviel lost 4.9 billion euros ($5.7 billion) at French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and internal controls at financial firms are meant to prevent individual traders taking such large positions.
 But Harouna Traore was able to buy 43,941 S&P500 futures contracts worth $5.3 billion and 34,388 Eurostoxx 50 futures contracts worth 1.2 billion euros on June 29 last year through London broker Valbury Capital, trading records reviewed by Reuters show. 
When contacted, Traore, 41, referred to a court document reviewed by Reuters in which he confirmed the trades and said they had resulted from a mistake because he had initially thought he was trading on a practice platform where trading limits did not apply, rather than, as it turned out, a live one.
He is now suing Valbury Capital in a French court, alleging the broker has kept the $11 million of gains from his trades.
Valbury Capital referred questions to Robert Falkner, a partner at law firm Reed Smith which is representing the broker. Falkner said there was a contractual limit on Traore's account, but declined further comment.
A June 16, 2017, email from Valbury Capital to Traore, seen by Reuters, shows the French trader's 20,000 euro account had a trading limit of just 10 futures contracts per day. 
""There was a mistake on his account,"" said Tarek Elmarhri, head of the Krechendo French trading arcade in Paris whose trading facilities are used by Traore and other day traders.
This meant Traore ""could buy unlimited contracts"" on the system he had only just spent eight weeks being trained to use, Elmarhri said. Traore asked Elmarhri to review with him the June 29 trading when he came back the following Monday to the Krechendo trading arcade.
In the risk parameters for Traore's account with Valbury Capital, according to a screenshot of the account seen by Reuters, the user credit is indicated as ""unlimited"" by the broker.
The huge positions racked up by Traore are many times above what seasoned traders at investment banks are routinely allowed to buy during a day of trading, Elmarhri said.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and France's AMF both declined to comment on Thursday.
'IN SHOCK'
Trading records reviewed by Reuters show Traore first traded Eurostoxx 50 futures contracts on the afternoon of June 29, a position which he closed before the European market shut, leaving him with a 2.4 million euro loss.
 He then began trading S&P500 futures and managed to close his position with a profit of $13.6 million, although he could have lost between 100 and 200 million euros had stock markets fallen between three and four percent, Krechendo's Elmarhri said.
Traore lost 900 euros at the Krechendo arcade trading room on the morning of June 29, adding he decided to go home to practice on a training version of the platform.
This was when he built up the huge futures positions. He told Reuters that he only realised he was trading ""live"" when he saw he had reached losses amounting to a million euros.
""I thought that it was the end of my life. I thought how am I going to pay back all that?"", Traore said, adding it was then that he decided to try to trade his way back to a profit.
Having succeeded, Traore stayed at home the next day.
""I was in shock,"" he said.
 Traore said he received trading and settlement statements from Valbury Capital as usual the next day and had no other contact with the broker before he called them the next week to explain what had happened.
The trader said he had not been aware before making his multi-billion trades that his account allowed him to make unlimited orders and denied he knew he was on a live platform.
Elmarhri said that because Traore had settled his trades with a profit before any margin calls were made, his super-sized trading positions went undetected until the following week.
 ""This could happen again, current regulations are not effective"", Elmarhri said, stressing that trading limits are supposed to be strictly implemented by brokers.
Traore worked from 2013 to 2017 for Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters, his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile shows.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian workers who assemble Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) turboprops and the company's new top-of-the-line business jet on Saturday reached a tentative agreement with the company just hours ahead of a strike deadline, the union said. 
Unifor, the union representing the 1,600 workers, has previously said its members were looking for a three-year contract with greater job security on the company's strong-selling Global 7500 business jet, among other demands.
A Bombardier spokesman confirmed that a tentative agreement has been reached. Union members are set vote on Sunday to ratify the agreement.
The long-range jet, which is to enter service this year, is a critical part of Bombardier's strategy to grow business aircraft revenues to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017.
Union workers at Bombardier's Downsview plant in Canada's largest city Toronto assemble several large-cabin business jets, along with the Q400 turboprops. 

The union talks follow Bombardier's May announcement that it had agreed to sell the sprawling Downsview site, the company’s largest land asset, to a Canadian pension fund for approximately $635 million. Bombardier will continue to operate from Downsview for a period of up to three years, with two optional one-year extension periods.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2018 04:35AM ET</span>",Xiaomi puts indefinite delay on CDRs in blow to China's plans for tech listings,"By Julie Zhu and Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp  said on Saturday there is no time frame for a mainland share offering, casting doubt on Beijing's efforts to lure foreign-listed Chinese tech giants back home.
Xiaomi had been expected to raise up to $10 billion, split between its Hong Kong and mainland offerings. But in a surprise move this week, it postponed its mainland share offering until after it completes its scheduled July 9 listing in Hong Kong.
It did not say when it would restart its China depositary receipts (CDRs) issuance process or why it was postponing the mainland offering. 
Sources told Reuters the decision was mainly because of a dispute between the company and Chinese regulators over the valuation of its CDRs, but the company denied this.
""We've had many rounds of discussions with the regulators and reached a consensus that to ensure the quality of our CDR issuance, it's better that we go public in Hong Kong first,"" Xiaomi's chief financial officer, Shou Zi Chew, told a news conference in Hong Kong.
Xiaomi, which also makes internet-connected devices, awarded its chief executive and co-founder Lei Jun about $1.5 billion worth of shares for his contribution to the company, it said in an updated regulatory filing this week, in one of the largest one-off share-based corporate bonuses in years.
The $1.5 billion stock, which has been awarded to Lei's holding entity - Smart Mobile Holdings Ltd - was recorded by Xiaomi as share-based compensation expenses on April 2, one month before it filed for its blockbuster Hong Kong IPO. 
Xiaomi is the latest high-profile company to lavish its senior executives with large stock awards ahead of a stock market flotation in recent years. 
Its co-founder and president, Lin Bin, defended the board's decision on the compensation.
""Many new-economy companies have compensated their chairmen or CEOs with stocks ahead of the IPOs. Xiaomi isn't the first and won't be the last to do so,"" he said at the news conference. 
Lin added Xiaomi's board unanimously agreed on the stock award to Lei, who ""completely knew nothing about it"".
Chinese e-commerce powerhouse JD.com (O:JD) awarded CEO Richard Liu stocks worth nearly $900 million at the company's IPO price, ahead of its New York listing in 2014. 
Xiaomi has lined up $548 million from seven cornerstone investors including U.S. chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) for its Hong Kong IPO, Reuters reported on Thursday.
The offering is set to be the first listing under new exchange rules designed to attract tech floats, as competition heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland.
It is selling about 2.18 billion shares at a price range of HK$17 to HK$22 ($2.17 to $2.80) each, representing a multiple of 22.7–29.3 times 2019 earnings forecast by its underwriting syndicate. 
The IPO values the Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled company at $54.3 billion - $70.3 billion after a 15 percent ""greenshoe"" or over-allotment option which can be sold if there is demand. If the greenshoe is exercised, Xiaomi's free float will be 9.99 percent of its enlarged share capital.
The new valuation range is far below the $100 billion touted by sources this year and below the more recent $70 billion plus valuation target that some analysts and investors see as aggressive. 
CEO Lei said he expected to expand its product range and international market presence. Xiaomi’s phones are sold in 74 countries.
""I agree the smartphone market in the next 10 years will grow slowly. But still, it is a giant market,"" Lei said.
Set up in 2010, the company doubled its smartphone shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales.
Xiaomi also makes dozens of internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers.

(This version of the story corrects Xiaomi's scheduled listing date is July 9, not July 7, in paragraph 2)

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Investors turn up pressure on British firms in 2018 AGM season,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British companies facing material dissent from investors at their shareholder meetings jumped in the first half of the year, with votes against individual directors doubling from 2017.
Ninety-four companies were added to the Public Register - which lists companies that saw opposition of more than 20 percent on any vote or which withdrew a resolution - in the year to June 8, trade body the Investment Association said.
The IA, whose members manage nearly 7 trillion pounds in assets, set the register up after a major review into corporate governance by the government last year, in the wake of growing discontent about corporate culture and behavior.
At the midway point of the season for annual guseeneral meetings of companies in the FTSE All-Share index (FTAS), the IA said a total of 140 individual resolutions had seen votes against of more than 20 percent, while 14 were withdrawn.
Thirty-four companies faced director-related resolutions in that period, up 62 percent on a year earlier, while the number of individual resolutions with more than 20 percent votes doubled to 54 from 27.
""An emerging trend midway through this year's AGM season is the increase in directors receiving high votes against their re-election,"" said Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship and corporate governance at the IA.
""Directors are getting a very clear message from shareholders that they will be held accountable for their actions.""
Forty companies were added because of pay-related issues, compared with 35 who faced similar action at the same point a year earlier, although the number of individual resolutions that saw votes in opposition of at least 20 percent dipped slightly to 47 from 48, the IA said.
Crucially, said Ninian, companies were also doing more to explain themselves. Of those added this year, 74 percent acknowledged the vote and explained their planned response, up from 55 percent of companies in the prior year.
""The Public Register is shining a spotlight on companies subject to high levels of shareholder rebellion. After only seven months of operation, the increased scrutiny brought by the Public Register is clearly working,"" Ninian said.
""We now expect these companies to follow up with a further statement within six months of their AGM, outlining the actions taken and views heard from their shareholders.""

More than a third of the companies added to the register in 2018 had faced similar issues a year earlier, the IA said, with 28 instances of companies flagged for the same resolution.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Trump greets EU trade reprisals with threat of steep auto tariff,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to escalate a trade war with Europe by imposing a 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports of European Union-assembled cars.
Trump posted his threat on Twitter the day European Union reprisals took effect against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. The EU targeted $3.2 billion in American goods exported to the 28-member bloc.
""If these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!"" Trump wrote.
A month ago, the administration launched a probe into whether auto imports pose a national security threat.
The United States currently imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on imported passenger cars from the European Union and a 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. The EU imposes a 10 percent tariff on imported U.S. cars.
German automakers Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG build vehicles at plants in the United States. Industry data shows German automakers build more vehicles in southern U.S. states that voted for Trump than they ship to the United States from Germany.
The European Autos Stocks Index fell sharply after Trump’s tweet and closed down 0.5 percent. Shares of U.S. automakers Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) fell immediately after Trump's tweet but rebounded and closed higher.
The Commerce Department has scheduled two days of public comments in July in its probe of the national security implications of imported automobiles and auto parts. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday the department aims to wrap up the probe by late July or August, but added the probe is in its ""early stages.""
Last month, Evercore ISI said in a research note that a 25 percent import tariff on auto imports ""would pretty much destroy the business of importing cars from Europe/China"" to America.
Major automakers and at least two dozen auto suppliers are gearing up to file written comments sharply opposing the tariffs before a June 29 deadline. U.S. auto executives said privately they have spent months looking at the potential impacts to sales of new tariffs, and they view the presidential tweet as a sign significant new tariffs appear likely.
Trump has launched or threatened an array of trade measures, saying he aims to create U.S. jobs and protect domestic industries. 
He has threatened duties on up to $450 billion of imports from China. Such a move could raise prices for American consumers and businesses and hit global supply chains for industries like carmakers and electronics. Chinese reprisals have hit American farmers already. 
Trump’s trade policies have also escalated conflict with Canada and Mexico as he seeks to renegotiate the $1.1 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement.
German automakers did not comment on Trump's tweet.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing major U.S. and European automakers, said ""tariffs raise vehicle prices ... limit consumer choice and invite retaliatory action by our trading partners. Automakers support reducing trade barriers across the board.” 
German auto industry association VDA said Germany exported 657,000 cars to North America, 7 percent less than a year earlier, and 200,000 fewer cars than in 2013.
German-built vehicles exported to the United States fell 10 percent to 494,000 vehicles, while German automakers produced 804,000 vehicles in the United States last year. Automotive News data shows about 7.2 percent of vehicles sold in the United States through May were assembled in Europe.
Trump has repeatedly criticized German auto imports. He reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron he wanted to halt Mercedes-Benz models from driving down Fifth Avenue in New York City. He told automakers at a White House meeting in May he was planning tariffs on some imported vehicles.
Republican lawmakers and business groups have opposed higher auto tariffs.
The Auto Alliance has said it was “confident that vehicle imports do not pose a national security risk.”
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that American auto production has doubled over the past decade, and said tariffs “would deal a staggering blow to the very industry it purports to protect and would threaten to ignite a global trade war.”

The United States in 2017 accounted for about 15 percent of worldwide Mercedes-Benz and BMW brand sales. It accounts for 5 percent of VW brand sales and 12 percent of Audi sales.

1643,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. Tariff Turmoil Tanks US Stocks
US markets were swayed by a rally in tech and fears of a U.S.-China trade war, but it was the latter that ultimately prevailed, leaving the major U.S. indexes nursing a weekly loss.
The U.S. and China exchanged a fresh volley of trade threats, scaling back investor appetite for risker assets amid fears of an tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Trade war concerns failed, however, to stem demand for tech stocks as major tech blue chips such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied sharply, helping the Nasdaq close at a record high this week.
Internet retailers like eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstockcom Inc (NASDAQ:OSTK) came under pressure Thursday, however, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Quill ruling, allowing states and local governments to start collecting sales taxes from internet retailers.
Shares of Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) were also in demand for the second week in a row after the media company accepted an improved $71 billion bid from Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS).
The S&P 500 posted a weekly loss despite closing 0.25% higher Friday at 2,759.50.
2. Crude Oil Prices Soar as OPEC Hike Cheered
OPEC agreed Friday to a modest increase in output, sending crude oil prices soaring on expectations that the fresh supply into the market would be curbed as some countries lack the capacity to raise output.
OPEC said it wanted countries –part of the production cut agreement – to increase production, returning to 100% compliance with agreed quotas by 1 July 2018.
Analysts said the agreement would equate to increase in production of about 600,000 barrels a day as numerous countries in the accord aren't capable of increasing production.
Crude prices were also supported by a mixed U.S. inventory report as domestic crude supplies fell for the second straight week while crude products such as gasoline and distillate increased by more than analysts had forecast.
Crude futures settled 4.64% higher at $68.58 higher on Friday.
3. Euro Spoil's Dollar's Week
The dollar ended the week lower as trade war concerns flared up, stoking demand for safe-haven yen, while a rebound in the euro on mostly positive economic data also weighed on sentiment.
EUR/USD rebounded from an 11-month low seen Thursday, prompting traders to flee the greenback despite lingering concerns over Italian political uncertainty and lower-for-longer interest rates in the Eurozone.
The dollar's sluggish end to the week comes just days after its rise to fresh 2018 highs was met by a wave of resistance despite expectations that a more hawkish Federal Reserve would provide further room for upside in the greenback.
""The divergence between U.S. and rest of the world monetary policy will support longer and greater USD strength than we had anticipated,"" Barclays said earlier this week in a note to clients.
The dollar was also held back by yen strength supported by rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
The dollar fell 0.36% to 94.20 against basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Fails to Ride Dollar's Dash Lower 
Gold prices bounced from fresh 2018 lows this week but remained under pressure struggling to take advantage of a weaker dollar and rising safe-haven demand as sentiment on the yellow metal waned.
Fearing a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes, investors have shunned the yellow metal even as safe-haven demand grows on the back of an ongoing trade spat between the U.S. and China.
5. Bitcoin Slumps as Traders Flee
Fresh selling was seen in Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) Friday, as the crypto hit its lowest level since February after Japan's regulatory crackdown on the industry triggered a selloff.
Japan's largest crypto exchange, bitFlyer, suspended the creation of new accounts after Japan's Financial Services Agency ordered several cryptocurrency exchanges to step up their efforts to combat money laundering. 
That sent shockwaves through the crypto industry amid fears other crypto exchanges in Japan could also be forced to scale back operations as they seek to beef up their practices.
As Japan is the largest market for bitcoin trading, the threat of a reduction in fresh fund inflows, sparked selling across cryptos, wiping more than $20 billion from the crypto market in under 24 hours.
The total crypto market cap fell to about $261 billion, at the time of writing, from about $289 billion Thursday.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin 4.84% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum fell 3.82%, while Ripple XRP fell 8.53% on the Poloniex exchange."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed on Friday, as the Dow put to rest an eight-day losing streak with a boost from energy stocks, but losses in the technology space kept the Nasdaq in check.
U.S. crude settled up 4.6 percent at $68.58 a barrel and Brent settled 3.4 percent higher at $75.55 after oil producers agreed to modest crude output increases to compensate for losses in production at a time of rising global demand.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) rose 2.1 percent and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) gained 2.0 percent, as the two biggest boosts to the S&P. The S&P energy index was up 2.2 percent, as the sector notched its strongest day in June.
A rally in oil prices due to OPEC's earlier decision to restrict supply in an effort to drain global inventories has given the sector a gain of more than 11 percent for the quarter-to-date, best among the 11 major S&P groups.
""That is the big news of the day, both the OPEC news and just the reaction of the stocks as well,"" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, New York.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 119.19 points, or 0.49 percent, to 24,580.89, the S&P 500 gained 5.12 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,754.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 20.14 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,692.82. 
For the week, the Dow lost 2 percent, its weakest weekly performance since late March. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq declined 0.7 percent. 
Trade worries still loomed, however, as U.S. President Donald Trump, in his latest move, threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all European Union car imports. The announcement came a month after the administration launched a probe into whether auto imports pose a threat to national security.
""Certainly the longer it drags out, the market is bound to see some pressure, at least in some sectors and with certain companies,"" said Ghriskey. 
Harley-Davidson fell 2.3 percent. The U.S. motorbike maker has in the past warned of a ""significant impact"" on its sales if the European Union decides to increase duties on motorcycles in retaliation. The S&P autos & components index dipped 0.5 percent.
This adds to worries about the China-U.S. trade spat which escalated this week after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports and Beijing vowed to retaliate. 
Leading the decliners among tech was open source software provider Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT), which tumbled 14.2 percent after its current-quarter and full-year revenue missed analysts' estimates due to a strengthening dollar.
Microsoft's 0.72 percent decline and Nvidia's 2.40 percent fall also weighed.
The trade spat has pushed the Dow Jones index lower for the past eight sessions as big industrial companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) have weighed on the index and put it on pace for its worst weekly performance in 13 weeks.
The latter stages of Friday's trading brought a surge of volume ahead of FTSE Russell's reconstitution of its indexes, finalized after the market close.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 41 new lows. 

About 9.70 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 7.17 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped to a more than four-month low on Friday, continuing a downtrend after more negative headlines such as Japan's financial regulator ordering six digital currency exchanges to make improvements on their anti-money laundering systems.
The original virtual currency fell as low as $6,085.59 on Bitstamp, the lowest since early February and not far from this year's trough of just below $6,000. It was last down more than 8 percent at $6,177.45.
So far in 2018, bitcoin has fallen nearly 56 percent, after soaring more than 1,300 percent last year.
The order from Japan's Financial Services Agency on Friday includes Inc, one of the country's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.
Early this week, the cryptocurrency world was racked by news South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb was hacked of 35 billion won ($31.5 million) worth of virtual coins.
The Bithumb attack was preceded earlier this month by a ""cyber intrusion"" at Coinrail, a relatively small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, causing a loss of about 30 percent of the coins traded on the exchange.
""Often swings in prices are blamed on events like hacks of crypto exchanges, or news from regulators,"" said Chris Tse, founding director of the Cardstack project in New York, which is leading efforts to create a new blockchain-based internet.
Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.
Tse noted that bitcoin, even before these recent events, has been in a bearish momentum. 
""If the crypto market were a NASCAR race - there would be a yellow caution flag waving right now. There was massive exuberance, then a massive crash, and now we're cleaning up the debris and figuring out what's going on,"" Tse said.
Other digital currencies also declined in sympathy with bitcoin on Friday. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down nearly 10 percent at $472.99. 
The third-largest, Ripple, lost 7 percent to $0.49 according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.
In a recent report explaining the slowdown in the market, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Thomas Lee said there have not been sufficient inflows into the cryptocurrency space this year. 
""Incremental retail and institutional demand was expected to materialize in 2018, but regulatory actions by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) have impaired progress,"" Lee said.

""The SEC has taken needed steps in 2018, targeting ICO (initial coin offerings) scams, but the uncertainty around which projects are securities versus commodities has created substantial uncertainty,"" he added.

In a letter https:// to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Congress members Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mark Walker called for ""immediate action to determine whether Russian national Vladimir Yevtushenkov meets the criteria to be sanctioned"".
Sistema holds the assets of Yevtushenkov, such as Russia's top mobile phone operator MTS, retailer Detsky Mir, microelectronics and technological firm RTI and pulp and paper manufacturer Segezha. 
""According to publicly available information, Mr. Yevtushenkov's companies have been involved in large-scale investment and construction projects in the Crimea region of Ukraine that has been illegally occupied and annexed by the Russian Federation"", said the letter, published on Ros-Lehtinen's website. 
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the letter. 
""We have no investments in Crimea or Sebastopol (the Russian Navy base in the region)"", Sistema spokesman Sergei Kopytov said, adding the company had also not received any official queries on the allegations made in the letter.
On April 6, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska and companies in which he is a major shareholder, including the world's second-largest aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486), in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia.

The firms owned by billionaire Viktor Vekselberg were also hit with sanctions, as Washington responded to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Earlier this week, the European Commission said it would start charging import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. products from Friday after Washington imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum at the start of June.
""Of course this will have an impact on the price. We will try and make it as painless as possible but no company can foot this alone,"" Christian Arnezeder told Reuters TV in an interview.
A spokeswoman for the company said the group was still evaluating the potential impacts of EU duties, and that no decisions on pricing had been made.
Harley says it is getting hit by tariffs twice: Once by the EU import duty and once by a rise in raw material prices resulting from U.S. steel tariffs.
For the moment, though, Harley does not need to raise prices as it used the roughly three months since Europe first threatened to impose duties on its motorcycles to prepare.
""We tried to get the current model to Europe as quickly as possible, as far as production allowed for it,"" Arnezeder said.
He also said that the anticipation of tariffs boosted demand as customers sought to snap up motorcycles before prices rise.
""You could tell on the market, in talking to dealers, that some customers said, I want to fulfill my dream before any tariffs come into effect,"" he said.

Struggling to overcome a slump in U.S. demand, Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently. Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for little over 21 percent of its global retail sales in the last quarter.

""Damages against former management board members are under serious consideration, I'm not just saying that,"" he told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview when asked whether Volkswagen (VW) would seek damages from Winterkorn.
""Once we know the outcome of investigations, we will make a decision,"" said Weil, who represents the German state of Lower Saxony, a VW shareholder, on the company's board.
VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating, but U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against Winterkorn earlier this year.
This month, Munich prosecutors widened their probe into VW's premium brand Audi. They said they were investigating Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market. 
This week they arrested Stadler, citing concerns he might try to interfere with the investigation. The arrest prompted the supervisory board to suspend him and name Bram Schot to take over as interim Audi CEO.
Asked by Sueddeutsche why Stadler was suspended rather than removed entirely, Weil said many questions remained unanswered.
""It is a matter of fairness to wait until the matter is cleared up. Any normal employer would do that,"" he said, adding he could not predict whether Stadler would return to his post.

Stadler remains remanded in custody but has not been charged with a crime. VW and Audi have said that Stadler should be presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.

Turkey goes to the polls June 24, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- who’s pressed for lower interest rates -- battling for reelection. Mexico and Indonesia also contest in the next two weeks. Colombia has already passed its election hurdle, with market-favorite Ivan Duque’s victory this month helping make the peso the best-performing emerging currency so far in 2018.
Political risk poses another headwind to developing-nation stocks that are heading for their worst quarter since the mid-2015 angst over a China hard landing, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down more than 7 percent.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said in a note this week elections in Brazil and Mexico leave the bank shy of the real and peso, with “political clarity required to unlock” value in the currencies.
Rising U.S. Treasury yields and a strengthening dollar have already done damage, spurring -- in Asia’s case -- the biggest equity capital outflow since the 2008 financial crisis.
“With the Fed’s rate hike and an escalation in the U.S.-China trade frictions, election results will inevitably get more attention,” said Tsutomu Soma, general manager for fixed-income trading at SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’d be a double whammy for emerging markets if both the economy and politics turn sour.”
Risk goes both ways, as the Colombia example shows. And with that, here’s the timeline and points of focus for major elections coming up through 2019:

The iShares MSCI Mexico ETF, known by its ticker EWW, had about $117 million of inflows over the past four days, the second most for any week since 2016. The fund’s short interest had been climbing, reaching about 64 percent of float on June 11, according to S3 Partners LLC. But it has since fallen to less than 52 percent of float.
“Feels like a lot of Nafta angst has been built into the stocks, with EWW approaching last year’s multi-year lows,” said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading Institutional Services.
The peso had been under pressure from the Nafta negotiations and the July 1 Mexican presidential election, with traders accepting the likelihood that leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would be the next president. EWW followed the weakening path, hitting the lowest level in over a year in early June.
But this week’s slide in the dollar and the decision by Mexico’s central bank to raise interest rates allowed the peso to take a breather from the weakening trend that started in mid-April. The currency is headed toward a gain of around 3 percent for the last five days after three straight weekly slides.
“Investors can use EWW to get exposure to the peso in the short term,” a BlackRock spokeswoman said. “And EWW’s deep options and two-way markets help facilitate views with a short bias.”

NEW YORK (IFR) - When Campbell Soup came to the investment-grade bond market in March with a $5.3 billion deal to finance its acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, investor response was lukewarm.
Demand was tepid partly because some bond investors didn't believe the merger would stem a decline in sales - at least not enough to compensate for the increase in the company's leverage. 
But the buyside's wariness was also driven by the soup maker's ratings.
Campbell suffered a two-notch downgrade by Moody's (to Baa2 from A3) when it more than doubled leverage to finance the deal. And with that, Campbell joined a growing number of corporates whose ratings now sit on the fringes of junk.
Leverage across investment-grade bonds globally stood at 2.6 times last year compared with 2.0 times in 2007, according to Moody's, and there's little sign that it will fall anytime soon.
""Companies have utilized a significant amount of debt to finance M&A,"" Jon Duensing, director of investment grade credit at Amundi Pioneer, told IFR.
""And that calls into question their ability to refinance, pay down that debt and to grow their corporate capital structure in the future.""
DEBT BINGE
Corporate America's debt binge has seen the US investment-grade bond market balloon to over $6 trillion in the past 10 years from just US$2.5trn in 2008, according to data from ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Half of that is rated in the Triple B band, leaving some investors and analysts fretting about how a recession could hit corporate earnings and tip many of these companies into junk.
""The Triple B cohort is so big that if you do have a massive recession, you could have a ton of fallen angels,"" said Eddie Hebert, client portfolio manager at PPM America.
""These are huge capital structures. Who is going to be the marginal buyer when these companies have to issue more debt?""
NOT ALONE
Campbell is in some ways the poster child of risks that stem from debt-funded acquisitions that then do not deliver what they set out to do.
Just three months after its bond sale, Campbell's profitability fell sharply and its CEO resigned. The bonds have widened by more than 80bp since issuance.
Moody's has threatened to downgrade Campbell again as its Baa2 rating was based on expectations of a reduction in leverage to below four times earnings in the next two years. That looks like a challenge now.
""As some of these companies borrow more to help finance these acquisitions, they're getting themselves into a position where they have less margin for error,"" said Duensing.
""That is really the difference between an investment-grade company and a high-yield company.""
Other companies in the pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and telecommunications sectors have seen plays go awry after similarly levering up to pursue M&A.
Belgian brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, for example, acquired SAB Miller for US$110bn two years ago. That deal boosted its leverage to more than five times earnings, according to Moody's. 
At the time, senior management said it was targeting a ratio of two times over the longer term.
But instead of selling assets to pay down debt, AB InBev earlier this year sold another US$10bn of bonds to partly pre-finance debt maturities coming due in 2019 and 2020.
At the end of last year, the company had a $116 billion gross debt load and net debt/Ebitda of 4.9 times, according to CreditSights.
Analysts at the firm called the bond sale ""mildly troubling"", mainly because the company's deleveraging plans rest on projected improvements in earnings rather than debt reduction.
NO DISASTER YET
For now, few expect a flood of downgrades.
But over time, even if just 10% of Triple B corporate bonds were downgraded to junk, that would see around $300 billion of debt move into high-yield.
That would be more than the $275 billion of new issues the US high-yield market absorbed in the whole of 2017, according to IFR data, and could cause borrowing costs to rise if investors are unable to absorb the additional supply.
An Armageddon scenario is still seen as a stretch though.
""These companies have levers they can pull to protect their access to the capital markets and protect their credit ratings if they need it,"" said Duensing. ""That's an important consideration as they move down the road.""
That kind of confidence is allowing Triple B companies to continue to raise billions of dollars in debt.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) (Baa1/BBB) recently slipped into the Triple B band after downgrades by Moody's and S&P because of its debt-financed acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). But it raised US$15bn through a bond sale on Monday without trouble: it got over $45 billion in orders.
Others, too, are putting ratings at risk to appease shareholders - and not just through M&A.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) was downgraded to Baa1/BBB+ on Wednesday after it said it would increase the amount it plans to return to shareholders by 2020 to $25 billion. That's an increase from the $15 billion is stated in November 2017.
S&P said it ""represents a rapid shift in financial policy while the company is experiencing a slowdown in comparable sales growth"", and expects the company to raise $3 billion in debt.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Renewable energy seeks demand, investment to survive Trump squeeze","By Dave Gregorio
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wind and solar industries hope demand for carbon-free power from U.S. cities, states and corporations can offset headwinds from President Donald Trump's tax policy and tariffs, developers said this week. 
The Trump tax overhaul trimmed production and investment tax credits, and the administration also slapped a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. The moves, aimed at boosting manufacturing and economic growth, also dimmed prospects for renewables.
But Trump's withdrawal of federal support for Obama-era climate goals indirectly helped the industry by inspiring a backlash among U.S. cities, states and corporations, which have grown more ambitious about installing cleaner forms of energy. 
Also, investors with years of deals under their belts are less wary about financing solar and wind than they were years ago, and socially responsible funds are actively seeking projects to invest in, according to executives and investors at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum-Wall Street in New York.
Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, noted that two big solar projects worth about $2.5 billion total have been canceled or stalled since the tariffs were announced in January. The Solar Energy Industries Association has said the tariffs would result in the loss of 23,000 U.S. jobs.
But some manufacturers and developers have announced new projects in the face of the tariffs. Wetstone noted that solar led all generation sources with 2.5 gigawatts of new capacity in the first quarter of 2018.
'SEA CHANGE' IN DEMAND
""There is a sea change in grass-roots demand for renewable energy,"" Susan Nickey, managing director at Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc (N:HASI), which invests about $1 billion a year in the sector, said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference on Tuesday. 
""More and more corporations and consumers are saying 'We want 100 percent renewable energy,'"" she said, adding city and state governments are adopting renewable-friendly policies to reflect that growing demand.
She cited a survey of financial institutions that showed two-thirds of respondents planned to boost renewable investments this year. Some 89 percent said they would sharply increase planned investments from now to 2030 unless government policies slow demand for renewable energy. (https:// Craig Cornelius, president of NRG Energy Inc's (N:NRG) NRG Renewables, told a panel at the conference that while Trump's tax bill was initially worrying, ""it has been ultimately easier to work through the repercussions than we anticipated.""  As the bill moved through Congress, Republican lawmakers from states with renewable projects joined Democrats to make changes. The final version kept 80 percent of the investment tax credit and production tax credit values, and dropped a proposed corporate alternative minimum tax that would have made the tax credits less valuable. ""Members on both sides of the aisle stepped out to support us,"" Laura Beane, president and chief executive officer of Avangrid Renewables, said on Wednesday. Avangrid is developing the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts. DODGING TARIFFS Quick action helped many developers dodge harm from U.S. tariffs on solar cells, noted Stacey Kusters, president of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Energy Co's [MEHC.UL] BHE Solar.  ""A lot of the projects that were planned went in and bought two years' worth of panels"" before the tariffs, she said.  Meanwhile, the industry is bracing for the scheduled reduction and ultimate expiry of lucrative subsidies on solar and wind power over the coming years, including a 30 percent tax credit on solar installations. This will make it trickier to finance some renewable projects, said Robert Sternthal, managing director at Rubicon Capital Advisors, who is putting together a team of bankers to advise on renewable deals in North America. Without the incentives, ""pricing may have to go up on the electricity side"" for some projects, he said on Tuesday. Yet he also expects growing demand from tech corporations that have pledged to be carbon-neutral and will not rely on wind or solar energy for profits.  ""Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) don't have to make 6 to 7 percent returns on these assets,"" he said. Improvements in technology could help make wind and solar more competitive ""in terms of cost and sustainability"" after tax credits expire, said Rafael Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of  Enel  (MI:ENEI) Green Power North America, whose projects include wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower.  Beane said Avangrid Renewables is betting on prospects for ""a lot of demand for offshore wind power in the U.S. Northeast."" The company starts construction on the Vineyard Wind project next year, and it is slated to come online in 2021.  
By then, she said, the project may be competitive on its own thanks to improved technology and expertise: ""You'll be very surprised at the prices.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's banking watchdog has proposed tighter rules for lenders that want to outsource essential operations such as IT, saying Brexit could trigger a big rise in such arrangements.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) said it wants a more harmonized and detailed framework to identify ""critical"" functions that are outsourced.
""Over the recent years, there has been an increasing tendency by institutions to outsource activities in order to reduce costs and improve flexibility and efficiency,"" EBA said in a statement on Friday.
""If such critical or important functions are outsourced, stricter and stronger requirements apply as compared to other outsourcing arrangements."" 
Regulators are concerned that many banks are outsourcing critical functions such as IT to the same firm, creating risk for the broader financial system if that firm went down.
EBA said its 62-page draft guidelines put out to public consultation are also relevant for banks based in ""third countries"" or non-EU states that want to gain or maintain access to the bloc's financial market.
""Outsourcing to third countries may change in volume after the UK has notified their intention to leave the European Union.""
Banks in London are opening or expanding hubs in the EU to maintain customer links after Brexit next March, but would like to use their UK base for some services.
""In particular, third country institutions may set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU in order to get or maintain access to EU financial markets and infrastructures, while the parent institution would provide a material part of the business activities,"" EBA said.
Banks in the EU must follow a ""due diligence"" process to assess risks before entering into outsourcing arrangements - and responsibility of a bank's management body can never be outsourced, EBA said.
""Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution becomes a so-called ‘empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorized.""
Banks must have written outsourcing agreements both for themselves and for regulators, and are required to maintain a register of all outsourcing arrangements, EBA said.

(Reuters) - The share of US institutional middle market loans that are classified as highly leveraged has hit a record high as strong investor demand continues to put pressure on midcap lending.
Excess investor demand is allowing private equity firms to produce aggressive borrower-friendly mid-market deals with similar terms to larger buyout loans, with lower spreads, looser documentation terms and less investor protection.
More than half of the middle market buyout deals sold to institutional loan buyers (53%) in 2018 so far have had leverage of 6.0 times or higher, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.
In 2017, nearly 49% of deals had leverage greater than 6.0 times and in 2007, prior to the financial crisis, only 24% of deals had leverage above that level.
“Sponsors can access all the cheap debt and incremental capacity they could want,” a middle market lender said.
At least two deals booked in the second quarter had leverage of more than 7.0 times total debt-to-Ebitda.
E-commerce software provider CommerceHub raised US$335m in first-lien debt in May that boosted leverage to 8.6 times along with a US$145m privately-placed second-lien term loan, according to Moody’s Investors Service. The loan funded private equity sponsors GTCR LLC and Sycamore Partners Management US$1bn acquisition along with a US$623m equity contribution.
Secure access software provider Bomgar signed a US$360m acquisition financing that backed its sale to Francisco Partners in April with total debt to Ebitda of 7.8 times. The debt package included a US$25m revolver, a US$240m first-lien term loan and a US$95m privately-placed second-lien term loan.
Highly leveraged deals are usually reserved for upper mid-market companies which can access the institutional loan market. Nearly two-thirds of the borrowers in the data set are larger firms with more than US$50m in Ebitda.
Banks rethinking
Banks pulled back from underwriting highly leveraged loans after US leveraged lending guidance was implemented in 2013, which opened the door to a flood of cash from private debt and direct lending strategies targeting middle market debt.
The influx of capital and resulting competitive market conditions has allowed many US middle market companies to access similarly aggressive terms and conditions to larger borrowers with more liquid loans.
Midcap firms were previously less able to finance buyouts cheaply, pursue opportunistic repricings and secure greater financial flexibility by adding incremental debt than big companies as they were seen as more risky and illiquid credit investments.
Regulators appointed by the Trump administration are now taking a softer stance on bank regulatory oversight and banks are now wondering if they can get back in the game after ceding market share to alternative lenders.
Regional banks, which were also sidelined by LLG, are now evaluating whether the regulatory shift means that they can safely underwrite more aggressive deals.
“We are willing to entertain (leverage) over 7.0 times,” a regional banker said.
Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said earlier this year that banks could underwrite deals outside the 6.0 times limit set in 2013, if pursued in a “safe and sound manner.” But although some banks are ready to move ahead, others remain mindful of the guidance.
“We are still underwriting to standards the regulators have put out,” a banker at another US regional bank said.  
While regional banks are unlikely to offer the highest leverage, regulators’ more flexible application of LLG suggests that they may be able to take a more holistic view instead of looking at leverage as an absolute.
“It does open up opportunities to be selectively more aggressive. We can lean in, in spots,” a third banker said.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 12:47PM ET</span>",U.S. unveils new veto threat against WTO rulings,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States ramped up its challenge to the global trading system on Friday, telling the World Trade Organization that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. 
The statement by U.S. Ambassador Dennis Shea threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism.
It came as U.S. President Donald Trump, who has railed against the WTO judges in the past, threatened to levy a 20 percent import tax on European Union cars, the latest in an unprecedented campaign of threats and tariffs to punish U.S. trading partners.
Shea told the WTO's dispute settlement body that rulings by the WTO's Appellate Body, effectively the supreme court of world trade, were invalid if they took too long. Rulings would no longer be governed by ""reverse consensus"", whereby they are blocked only if all WTO members oppose them.
""The consequence of the Appellate Body choosing to breach (WTO dispute) rules and issue a report after the 90-day deadline would be that this report no longer qualifies as an Appellate Body report for purposes of the exceptional negative consensus adoption procedure,"" Shea said, according to a copy of his remarks provided to Reuters.
An official who attended the meeting said other WTO members agreed that the Appellate Body should stick to the rules, but none supported Shea's view that late rulings could be vetoed, and many expressed concern about his remarks.
Rulings are routinely late because, the WTO says, disputes are abundant and complex. Things have slowed further because Trump is blocking new judicial appointments, increasing the remaining judges' already bulging workload.
At Friday's meeting the United States maintained its opposition to the appointment of judges, effectively signaling a veto of one judge hoping for reappointment to the seven-seat bench in September.
Without him, the Appellate Body will only have three judges, the minimum required for every dispute, putting the system at severe risk of breakdown if any of the three judges cannot work on a case for legal or other reasons.
""Left unaddressed, these challenges can cripple, paralyze, or even extinguish the system,"" chief judge Ujal Singh Bhatia said. 

Sixty-six WTO member states are backing a petition that asks the United States to allow appointments to go ahead. On Friday, U.S. ally Japan endorsed the petition for the first time, meaning that all the major users of the dispute system were united in opposition to Trump.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 12:19PM ET</span>",Schlumberger oil services wins in U.S. Supreme Court on patent damages,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Friday that companies can recover profits lost because of the unauthorized use of their patented technology abroad in a victory for Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB), the world's largest oilfield services provider. 
The 7-2 decision overturned a lower court's ruling that had enforced limits on applying U.S. patent law overseas and reduced by $93.4 million the damages sum that rival ION Geophysical Corp had to pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps find oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. Both companies are based in Houston.
The decision expands the ability of patent owners to recover foreign-based damages, increasing the threat posed by certain infringement lawsuits in the United States.
Internet-based companies and others had expressed concern that extending patent damages beyond national borders would expose U.S. high-technology firms to greater patent-related risks abroad. 
For graphic on ION Geophysical shares whipsawed by Supreme Court ruling click https://tmsnrt.rs/2K9GWv2 
The ruling initially sent ION's shares into a tailspin, diving as much as 20 percent at one point and triggering a 5-minute trading halt in the shares on the New York Stock Exchange. ION shares steadily recovered the loss, however, and are little changed on the day.
Schlumberger shares, meanwhile, are up 4 percent, but most of that gain occurred before the ruling was released and on the heels of a modest oil output increase agreement that was reached by OPEC earlier on Friday.
U.S. patent law generally applies only domestically, but Schlumberger said that since the law protects against infringement that occurs when components of a patented invention are supplied from the U.S. for assembly abroad, it should be fully compensated for the infringement, including any lost foreign sales. 
The high court agreed. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said ION infringed patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco in the United States.
The ""overseas events were merely incidental to the infringement,"" he said. 
Writing for the dissent, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that allowing overseas damages extends U.S. patent owners' monopolies over an invention to foreign markets.
""That, in turn, would invite other countries to use their own patent laws and courts to assert control over our economy,"" Gorsuch said. 
ION Chief Executive Brian Hanson said he was disappointed in the decision but that the company will press other arguments to avoid the damages when the case is returned to lower courts.
A spokeswoman for Schlumberger said the company was pleased with the decision allowing it to be ""compensated fully for monetary damages caused by those who choose to infringe its patents."" 
The case involved four WesternGeco patents related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations.
ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts.
The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties and $93.4 million in lost profits stemming from foreign contracts the company said it missed out on as a result of ION's infringement.
In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent issues, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion because U.S. patent law does not cover the overseas use of infringing products.

President Donald Trump's administration backed Schlumberger in the case. The case was made more complicated when the Federal Circuit on May 7 invalidated three of the patents at issue in the case, which could impact the overall damages owed.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>","'Zero' chance of Renault taking over Nissan, Mitsubishi: Ghosn","TOKYO (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) absorbing Nissan Motor Co. (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) is not an option as the carmakers look to strengthen their partnership while retaining their autonomy, alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn said on Friday. 
""Anybody who will ask Nissan and Mitsubishi to become wholly owned subsidiaries of Renault has zero chance of getting a result,"" Ghosn told shareholders of Mitsubishi Motors at a meeting. He also serves as chief executive of France's Renault. 
The alliance was the world's top-selling passenger vehicle maker in 2017, but as the global auto industry consolidates, it is looking to strengthen its position before the 64-year-old Ghosn, its main architect, retires in the coming years after overseeing the partnership for nearly 20 years.
Reuters reported in March that the carmakers were discussing a deeper tie-up, which could see the French government, a major shareholder in Renault, give up influence at Renault and the French carmaker relinquish control over Nissan.
The three automakers have a unique partnership designed to leverage their combined scale to save on costs including R&D, parts procurement and production to better compete with rivals Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
They are also interlinked by their shareholding structure. Renault holds 43.4 percent of shares in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Mitsubishi Motors joined the alliance in 2016 after Nissan took a 34 percent controlling stake in the smaller automaker. 
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has said the alliance is not discussing a ""full merger"".
Ghosn said that while the focus of the alliance was to sell more cars and increase profitability by reducing unnecessary duplication of processes, he wanted each of the three automakers to maintain their independence, which differentiated the group from Toyota and Volkswagen.
""We need to work together ... to find a system by which what we have today, which is working very well, can continue in the future no matter who is leading the alliance,"" he said.
""We need to prove that this is sustainable five years down the road, 10 years down the road, 15 years down the road.""

In a Figaro interview published last week, Ghosn was upbeat about the prospect of securing a new deal for the alliance despite its extreme political sensitivity in France and Japan, saying a plan would need to be announced ""well before"" the end of his four-year term at the helm of Renault in 2022.

Emerging-market equity, financials and investment-grade funds have suffered their biggest exodus since late 2016 as trade tensions and tighter monetary policy spur investors to separate the wheat from the chaff.
“At the moment, you’re seeing this unwind of the euphoria from January but nothing is so stretched that it’s a full buy signal,” Tommy Ricketts, a global investment strategist at the bank said by phone. “You’d have to see things really deteriorate.”
Investors pulled $7.7 billion from emerging-market equity and investment-grade credit funds in the week to June 20 since late 2016, according to BofA, citing EPFR Global data. Withdrawals from developing-nation and high-yield debt continued for the ninth and seventh consecutive week, respectively, reaching $3 billion combined.
All told, about $13 billion fled equities and $6 billion bonds, driven by mutual-fund outflows.
It’s a volte-face from early 2018 when the largest-ever allocation into stocks took the U.S. bank’s sell signal to highest since March 2013.
The Bull & Bear Indicator uses fund flows, positioning data and market technicals to quantify investor sentiment. This week it dropped to 2.9, with anything lower than 2 constituting a buy signal.
What would it take to break through that level? Further outflows, a tumble to less than 2650 for the S&P 500, compared with 2761 currently, or weak U.S. jobs data that disrupts the monetary trajectory, according to Bank of America.
“We remain bearish until then,” the strategists concluded in a note.
