Pansy Ho's property to transport conglomerate Shun Tak (HK:0242) said late on Wednesday that Ho and four other shareholders of SJM's holding company STDM have agreed to jointly vote their combined 53 percent stake to more efficiently manage SJM.
That puts the alliance's influence at SJM ahead of that of Angela Leong - the casino operator's co-chairman and current wife of Ho's 97-year-old father Stanley Ho. Leong holds 8 percent of SJM.
The news of the alliance helped send shares in SJM up more than 8 percent on Thursday, while Shun Tak rose 6 percent, as investors expected more stability in SJM's ownership.
SJM and Leong did not have immediate comments.
The move comes ahead of the expiration of casino licenses in the world's biggest gambling hub of Macau, where SJM and MGM's licenses are set to expire in 2020.
The concessionaires, which also include Wynn Macau, Sands Macau, Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027) and Melco Resorts (O:MLCO), don't have clarity yet on what happens when their licenses expire, starting next year.
About a third the size of Manhattan, Macau is the only place in China where casinos are allowed.
Born into a family that developed a flourishing gambling culture in the southern Chinese territory more than 50 years ago, Ho is spearheading a move to ensure stability, aiming to extend SJM's gaming concession and maintain STDM as the majority owner of SJM. 
In 2011, Stanley Ho sued family members in a high-profile dynastic fight in which he sought to recover billions in assets after a share restructuring he said was done without his consent.

The dispute was settled after two months but gave an insight into the factious nature of Ho’s family and the lifestyle of one of Asia’s wealthiest families.

(Reuters) - Global auto industry mergers more than doubled to an all-time high of $97.5 billion in 2018 from a year earlier, driven by mega-deals in the automotive parts sector, according to a report released on Thursday by consultancy PwC.
Five mega-deals, worth a combined $42 billion, in the component suppliers segment accounted for 43 percent of the total value of M&As last year as companies invested to keep up with a shift by carmakers into autonomous driving, connected cars and electric vehicles, the report said.
Cross-border M&A activity slowed in 2018 due to increased trade tensions and less focus on geographic expansion, PwC said.
The number of deals worth more than $1 billion, at 20, was the highest ever recorded by PwC, and more than twice the average seen over the previous three years.

The availability of capital and the pace of change in the industry should lead to a strong M&A environment this year despite macroeconomic headwinds, the report said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California power company PG&E Corp, which expects to soon file for bankruptcy, said on Wednesday it would cost between $75 billion and $150 billion to fully comply with a judge's order to inspect its power grid and remove or trim trees that could fall into power lines and trigger wildfires.
PG&E said in a filing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that it could not on its own afford the work proposed in a Jan. 9 order by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing conditions of the company's probation following a 2010 gas pipeline explosion.
To pay for the proposed work, PG&E said it would have to pass the bill to ratepayers who get their power from the utility company's nearly 100,000 miles (161,000 km) of overhead lines in northern California.
""PG&E would inevitably need to turn to California ratepayers for funding, resulting in a substantial increase - an estimated one-year increase of more than five times current rates in typical utility bills,"" the company said.
PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, is facing widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could top $30 billion following fatal wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
On Tuesday, PG&E said it had secured $5.5 billion in financing from four banks as it prepares to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on or about Jan. 29.
The utility on Wednesday estimated it would have to remove 100 million trees or more to safeguard power lines, a campaign that would face ""myriad legal obstacles to reconfiguring the California landscape,"" as it would require contending with state and federal agencies as well as private property owners.
A proposal to restrict using power lines deemed unsafe during high winds is not feasible because lines traverse rural areas to service urban zones, while ""de-energization"" of lines could also affect the power grid in other states, PG&E said.
State Senator Bill Dodd questioned PG&E's filing, underscoring the frustration of many California policymakers after they approved legislation last year to let utilities recover some of the costs related to wildfires in 2017 and others starting in 2019.
The legislation, which critics called a bailout, did not make provisions for fires last year and it was approved before November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history.
""PG&E's mismanagement and lack of credibility casts doubt over anything they put forward,"" Dodd told Reuters in an email. ""The company can and must do more to ensure safety, and I expect the court and regulators will make that happen.""
In separate court papers citing concerns about the complexity of regulations around PG&E's power transmission, the U.S. government recommended a court-assigned monitor review Alsup's proposals and consult with relevant agencies to reach ""workable"" terms for the company.
The government said the monitor is ""in the best position to determine whether wildfires can be prevented by fixing gaps in the currently regulatory scheme, or by improving PG&E’s compliance with current regulations.""
While PG&E questioned the judge's proposals, the company said it has no issue with the monitor checking its efforts to mitigate wildfire risks.

Alsup's order would modify terms of PG&E's probation. He will hold a hearing on the new terms on Jan. 30.

Citing a notice the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) distributed to media, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday evening that the CAC had accused Tencent’s “Tian Tian Kuai Bao”, which means “fast daily news,” of spreading vulgar information that “damaged the online environment.”
The app was previously taken down from the Android store in China last April after the Chinese watchdog asked the company to make changes to the content it was delivering.
Tencent has been ordered to overhaul its operations, the watchdog said in the notice, adding that it shut down nearly 9,382 apps and closed 733 websites over the past six months.
The Chinese internet giant was already under pressure earlier this week after its games were once again absent from a list of new titles to be approved by Chinese regulators.
The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television ended a 10-month-long halt on video-games approvals in December, giving the green light to a total of 260 games. Tencent has yet to have any of its titles approved so far."

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Wang said that “there will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but something that is certain is that China’s economy, China’s growth, will continue and will be sustainable.”
His comments came after China reported on Monday that the growth in its fourth-quarter GDP slowed to 6.4% from the previous quarter’s 6.5%, leaving 2018 growth the weakest in 28 years.
Wang added that the Chinese government is trying to remind people that the “quality, structure and efficiency” of the economic development is “what really matters.”
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.5% and 0.9% higher by 10:51 PM ET (03:51 GMT) on Thursday following Wang’s speech.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>","CEOs sour on Trump policies, warn they hurt business, investment","By Jessica DiNapoli and Soyoung Kim
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - From centre-stage in Davos last year, President Donald Trump told the world's corporate bosses that America is a great place to invest. It hasn't quite turned out that way.
Foreign direct investment to the United States fell in 2018, and companies gathered at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps this year say they are worried Trump's trade war with China will dampen the global economy and business investments even further.
One key complaint here this week: Companies increasingly reliant on consumers in China have had to lower their earnings outlooks as the world's second-largest economy cools.
And while the U.S. administration has cut taxes and regulations to attract new investment, a wave of caution is rippling through many industries in the United States.
""The trade war has been very damaging for the U.S. agricultural economy,"" said David MacLennan, chief executive of U.S. food and agricultural giant Cargill Inc, which announced worse-than-expected results out of China earlier in January.
""The longer this goes on, the worse it is,"" he told Reuters.
Foreign investment in the United States, which includes cross-border mergers and acquisitions and intra-company loans, fell about 18 percent in 2018 from the prior year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
That is close to the 19 percent year-on-year drop in foreign investment globally. But it is notable given the deregulation and tax cuts that might have otherwise fed into inward investment. In January of last year, at Davos, many executives said they planned to spend money in the U.S. in 2018.
While the U.N. trade agency attributed the global and U.S. declines to the tariffs that the United States and China have imposed on each other's imports since mid-2018, foreign investment in China actually rose 3 percent last year over the previous year. Foreign investment to India rose 7 percent.
Alan Jope, chief executive of consumer goods company  Unilever  (L:ULVR), said the United States remains a good market for its products, which include Dove deodorant, Magnum ice cream and Lipton tea. 
But it is China, where Unilever last year joined forces with ecommerce giant JD.com (O:JD) to move its products around the country, that has become the more resilient market.
Jope said China was ""one of our most reliable sources of growth. China provides the new stability in consumer consumption.""
RIPPLE EFFECTS
The U.S.-China trade war has hit industries around the world over the past few months.
Big Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA) have shrunk their plans to invest in the United States. Taiwan-based Foxconn (TW:2354) has scaled back its plans for a Wisconsin factory, and Chinese automaker GAC Motor [GACHA.UL] has also delayed a move into the U.S. market.
In September, Austria's fiber producer Lenzing halted a planned U.S. expansion, blaming rising tariffs between the United States and China.
Chinese textile exports to the U.S. are among the goods facing tariffs. Lenzing mothballed a $322 million project in Alabama to focus on setting up a new production facility in Thailand.
To be sure, foreign companies are still investing, particularly in the auto industry.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said earlier this month that it would invest $800 million to build a new electric car at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Toyota and Mazda are working on a new assembly plant, and Daimler and BMW are investing in existing operations.
But the economic malaise driven by the upending of trade flows is hitting tech companies hard due to both supply chain disruption and the economic slowdown in China. 
Apple (O:AAPL) this month warned of disappointing quarterly revenues, citing slowing iPhone demand in China.  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), the world's biggest maker of smartphones and the manufacturer of chips for other smartphone makers including Apple and Huawei, said its fourth-quarter profit likely dropped 29 percent.
""For the long run... I worry that the trend will expand to many other countries and industries, and at that time... we all will be negatively affected,"" Ken Hu, deputy chairman of China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], said in Davos.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, is ""probably suffering the most right now"" because it relies on heavily integrated and globalised supply chains, Hu said.
TRUMP LOOMS LARGE
As a result of the disruption, Trump's trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping is looming large over Davos this year, even if neither man is here. 
The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey by auditing and accounting giant PwC of nearly 1,400 chief executives showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs.
The PwC research showed 27 percent of executives from outside the United States see the United States as the number one place with the most potential for growth, down from 46 percent in 2018.
It's not only economics that is clouding the skies. Foreign companies, mainly Chinese, also face tighter scrutiny when they bring deals to the United States, after the Trump administration last year strengthened the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), said Stuart Eizenstat, former U.S. ambassador to the European Union and now head of law firm Covington & Burlington LLP's international practice.
CFIUS is an intra-agency panel that reviews acquisitions on national security grounds.
Chinese state-owned Sinochem Group [SASADA.UL], which has been in merger talks with ChemChina to create the world's biggest industrial chemicals firm, said that it did not think it could clinch a U.S. acquisition in the current environment.
""You know what's happening today, so I think you will see there will be less investment going abroad,"" Sinochem Chairman Ning Gaoning said.
""The Chinese are getting quite confused. They thought they were welcome to invest in other countries. Now they realize they are not being welcomed all the time.""
Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd [SUNTH.UL], told Reuters in an interview that the world has ""very big emotional leaders"" including one in the Washington. 
    ""Davos is a body to work on one voice, to give (a message that says): 'Come on, we have to be rational,'"" he said. ""Business should be the one to let them cool down.""

Dallas-based Texas Instruments (TI) missed Wall Street's estimates for quarterly revenue but beat on profit. Investors were fearing worse performance amid warnings of a slowing smartphone market from Apple Inc (O:AAPL). TI also forecast first quarter revenue and profit below estimates.
""People were expecting even worse results. It does not mean everything is behind them ...we are still in downturn and what macro does in the next few months and quarters nobody knows,"" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Tore Svanberg said.
Xilinx surged 8 percent in extended trade after the programmable chipmaker's quarterly results and outlook beat analysts' expectations. 
The company said that communications revenue rose 41 percent, boosted by rollouts and preparation for so-called 5G cell phone networks in South Korea and, to a lesser extent, China and North America.
Lam Research, which makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, jumped 7.4 percent after the bell following its better-than-expected quarterly results and its announcement of a $5 billion stock buyback authorization.
The semiconductor industry had a tumultuous opening to 2019 with concerns of global tech slowdown with warnings from  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330) and Apple, which earlier this month cut its quarterly sales forecast due to poor iPhone demand in China.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) is down 19 percent from its record high in March 2018. 
""Investors, for today at least, are probably hoping that cycle starts moving back up in the back half,"" said analyst Chaim Siegel from Elazar Advisors. 
After hours on Wednesday the rally included shares of Applied Materials Inc (O:AMAT), KLA-Tencor Corp (O:KLAC),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA)and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), which reports its results on Thursday.
Apple had blamed economic weakness in China and investors were seeking to learn more about China's economic performance. They also wanted indications if any weakness was widespread or specific to Apple. 
On a post-earnings call, Texas Instruments, which supplies touchscreen controllers, power management chips and a control device for Apple's iPhones and iPads, said demand in China was weaker than other regions. Personal electronics and specifically smartphones were weaker, including Chinese smartphone manufacturers.
""The weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. In addition, the microenvironment, including uncertainty caused by trade tensions, could impact the depth and duration of this cycle,"" said Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi on the call.
Shares of the Dallas-based company rose nearly 1.37 percent to $96.80 in after-hours trading.
Texas Instruments said revenue overall fell 1 percent to $3.72 billion. That missed analysts' average estimate of $3.74 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
TI's net income surged to $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $344 million or 34 cents a share a year earlier, thanks to a significantly lower provision for income taxes.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.27 per share, beating analysts estimates of $1.24.
The company expects first-quarter revenue of between $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings of $1.03 to $1.21 per share. 

Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $3.59 billion and earnings of $1.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A top executive from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] being held in Canada can make ""strong arguments"" against extradition to the United States, in part due to President Donald Trump's politicization of the case, Canada's ambassador to China said.
Canadian envoy John McCallum's comments to Chinese-language media, which were broadcast on Wednesday, are the most explicit sign yet from a Canadian official that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, may not be sent to the United States.
Meng was detained on Dec. 1 in Vancouver at the request of the United States https://reut.rs/2HuT3WE over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. She is currently under house arrest and China is demanding that she be freed https://reut.rs/2CDejnG.
In a clip shown by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, McCallum said Meng had ""quite good arguments on her side,"" the first of which was ""political involvement by comments from Donald Trump in her case.""
Trump told Reuters last month he would intervene in Meng's case if it served U.S. national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland quickly warned Washington not to politicize extradition cases.
McCallum also said extradition ""would not be a happy outcome,"" a comment that could irritate the Trump administration, which has generally cool relations with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government.
Huawei declined to comment on McCallum's remarks. 
The envoy's comments, which were made in English on Tuesday, are potentially awkward for Canada's government, which insists it cannot intervene because of judicial independence.
Trudeau sidestepped questions about the matter on Wednesday, telling reporters in Saskatchewan that under Canadian law Meng would have a chance to mount a strong defense.
The Liberals may face a tough reelection fight this October against the opposition Conservative Party, which said McCallum's actions raised ""questions of political interference.""
David Mulroney, an ex-Canadian ambassador to China, tweeted that McCallum's comments were ""almost impossible to understand.""
POSSIBLE OPTIONS
McCallum noted Canada has not applied the same sanctions against Iran as the United States.
""Canada does not sign onto these Iran sanctions. So I think she (Meng) has some strong arguments she can make before a judge,"" he said.
The U.S. Justice Department has until Jan. 30 to file a formal extradition request and Canadian officials will then take up to a month to decide whether an extradition hearing is warranted. Legal experts say they expect a hearing to be held.
""Canada respects its international legal commitments, including by honoring its extradition treaty with the United States,"" Freeland spokesman Adam Austen said in an email. 
Meng's arrest has hurt Canada's relations with China, which subsequently detained two Canadians https:// last month, citing national security concerns. Additionally, a Chinese court later retried a Canadian who had been jailed for drug smuggling and sentenced him to death https://reut.rs/2RKgaRJ.
McCallum said he saw three possible options for resolving the case. One would be Meng's extradition, which he said ""would not be a happy outcome and that would take years"" given that she could lodge legal appeals.
The second would be for the United States to make a deal with China whereby the extradition request would be dropped. The third would be Meng's release by a Canadian court on the grounds the U.S. request was not warranted.

McCallum, 68, a former Liberal cabinet minister, has made headlines in the past with offhand or colorful comments.

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) board will meet on Thursday to replace Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, in a move that could help ease tensions with alliance partner Nissan following Ghosn's arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct.
The meeting will start at 0900 GMT and consider the proposed appointment of outgoing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard as chairman and the promotion of Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore to CEO, three sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
The French carmaker has confirmed an emergency board meeting is planned for Thursday, but declined to comment on its agenda.
The decision, two months after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest and swift dismissal as Nissan (T:7201) chairman, turns a page on his two decades at the helm of the partnership he transformed into a global carmaking giant, following Renault's acquisition of a near-bankrupt Nissan in 1999.
Ghosn has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional Nissan compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the Japanese company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure. Ghosn has also denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008. Nissan has said it takes the matter seriously and pledged to improve corporate governance.
Ghosn has now agreed to resign from  Renault , the sources said - but only after the French government, its biggest shareholder, called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected by the Japanese courts.
As of late Tuesday, however, no formal resignation had been received, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.
Senard, 65, faces the immediate task of soothing relations with Nissan, which is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault and the junior partner in the alliance despite making more sales.
Since Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has sought to weaken Renault's control and resisted its attempts to nominate new directors to the Japanese company's board.

Nissan currently owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent and 34 percent in Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), a third major partner in their manufacturing alliance.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday its flying car prototype hovered briefly in the air during an inaugural test flight, a small but significant step as the world's largest planemaker bids to revolutionize urban transportation and parcel delivery services.
Boeing is competing with arch-rival Airbus SE and numerous other firms to introduce small self-flying vehicles capable of vertical takeoff and landing. 
The investments, fueled by leaps in autonomous technology as much as frustration with road congestion, could change the face of the aerospace industry within the next decade.
Boeing's 30-foot-long (9 meter) aircraft - part helicopter, part drone and part fixed-wing plane - lifted a few feet off the ground and made a soft landing after less than a minute of being airborne on Tuesday at an airport in Manassas, Virginia, Boeing said.
Future flights will test forward, wing-borne flight.
""This is what revolution looks like, and it's because of autonomy,"" John Langford, president and chief executive officer of Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, said in a news release announcing the test flight. 
Major hurdles to Boeing's vision of ""low-stress"" mobility - as it is called in the company's marketing materials - include sorting out numerous critical safety and regulatory issues to meld traditional roadway traffic with fleets of flying cars.
Boeing is working with startup SparkCognition Inc and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to develop a traffic-management system for three-dimensional highways, as well as the regulatory framework that will allow waves of autonomous vehicles to zip safely around buildings, the company has said.
Boeing bought Manassas-based Aurora Flight Sciences last year to speed development of a fleet of autonomous air vehicles. With Aurora, Boeing is also working on Uber Technologies Inc's (UBER.UL) UberAIR service for flights that are planned to be available for order via smartphones around 2023.
Boeing is looking to achieve a range of 50 miles with two flying car variants capable of carrying two and four passengers each. Tests are planned for later this year on a package-hauling version that can lift up to 500 pounds (226.8 kg).
Competitors range from Airbus, which says it has already conducted numerous flying vehicle test flights, to Volocopter, which has tested drone taxis that resemble a small helicopter powered by 18 rotors, and AeroMobil, with a stretch-limousine concept that can turn into a fixed-wing aircraft.
Vertical Aerospace, which completed a flight test last year, aims to offer short inter-city flights in the coming years with a piloted aircraft capable of carrying multiple passengers.

“The future of mobility – moving goods, moving cargo – moving people - that future is happening now and it’s going to accelerate over the next five years and ramp up even more beyond that,"" Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's president, chairman and CEO, told a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 06:54PM ET</span>",Ford fourth-quarter results weighed down by losses overseas,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday posted a lower operating fourth-quarter profit as losses in every global region except North America weighed on results.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker, which has announced an alliance with Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), is restructuring operations globally. It is making cuts in Europe, looking to reorganize its South American operations and turn around China - all unprofitable regions. 
""It was not a year we were happy with and the fourth quarter continued that theme,"" Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at the company's headquarters outside Detroit. He acknowledged the potential this year for disruptions such as strikes in regions where it is restructuring. 
In 2018, Ford took a $3.3 billion combined hit from higher tariffs and commodity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and recalls related to former airbag maker Takata. 
Last week, Ford provided a cloudier 2019 outlook because of tariff costs and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union, only saying it had the potential for higher earnings and revenue.
That was in contrast to Ford's larger U.S. rival, General Motors Co (N:GM), which on Jan. 11 forecast higher 2019 earnings that far surpassed analysts' estimates.
Shanks reiterated on Wednesday that Ford's market-leading presence in Britain gave it extensive exposure to the effects of Brexit. 
Ford said on Jan. 10 that it would cut thousands of jobs and look at plant closures in Europe as part of its plan to return to profit in the region. 
Ford posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $116 million, or 3 cents a share, down from a net profit of $2.5 billion, or 63 cents a share, in the same quarter in 2017, largely because of one-time pension costs and other charges. 
Excluding one-time charges, it earned 30 cents a share, in line with an outlook Ford executives provided last week that was shy of Wall Street's expectations.
In North America, Ford posted a pre-tax profit of $2 billion. It saw losses in every other region, with Asia reporting the largest loss of $381 million, driven by plummeting sales in China.
On Jan. 15, Ford and VW said they would join forces on commercial vehicles and were exploring joint development of electric and self-driving technology.
On Wednesday, sources said that Germany's automakers, including VW, were in talks to jointly develop autonomous cars. VW reiterated it was still looking for new partners, while Shanks said the companies were still in talks. 
Ford, which ended 2018 with $23.1 billion in cash, previously said it remained committed to its operations in Europe and South America, and its losses in China would narrow this year. Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on Wednesday that analysts ""don't have to wait long"" for Ford's South American reorganization plan. 

Ford shares rose about 1 percent to $8.41 in extended trading.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",Citadel's Griffin buys New York condo for record $238 million,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Citadel, has paid $238 million for a penthouse condominium overlooking Manhattan's Central Park, a spokesman for Griffin said on Wednesday, in a deal that sets a record for a U.S. home sale.
Griffin has closed on the unit in the 79-story residential tower, which is under construction for an estimated cost of $1.4 billion at 220 Central Park South.
The purchase follows on the heels of reports that Griffin bought a mansion in London within sight of Buckingham Palace for 95 million pounds ($124.2 million), among other recent deals.
The price paid for the New York condo eclipses the prior record for a U.S. residential purchase, set by another hedge fund billionaire, Barry Rosenstein, for a home in East Hampton, on New York's Long Island in 2014. 
The Griffin purchase also shatters the record for the most expensive apartment sold in New York City, which was last set by computer company founder Michael Dell's purchase last year of a condo for $100.47 million, according to published reports.
 Vornado Realty  Trust (NYSE:VNO), a real estate investment trust, is building 220 Central Park South and expects it to generate $1 billion in after-tax cash flow and net income once all condo units are sold, a regulatory filing in October showed.
The building, with 397,000 ""salable"" square feet, was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.
About 83 percent of the units are under sales contracts, with closings scheduled through 2020, according to Vornado, which declined to comment on Griffin's purchase.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the purchase by Griffin, who first signed a contract for the condo in 2015.
Griffin, who publisher Forbes estimates is worth $9.9 billion, in November paid $58.75 million for a four-level penthouse in Chicago, the most ever for a home in that city, according to media reports.
Public records show Griffin has spent close to $250 million for land in Palm Beach, Florida, the Journal said.

Vornado was represented by Deborah Kern of the Corcoran Group in the transaction, while Griffin was represented by Tal and Oren Alexander of the Alexander team at Douglas Elliman.

16,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 05:43PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Planes, Trains and … Drugs
Among the host of companies reporting earnings tomorrow, numbers from a few airlines will be flying into view.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will post fourth-quarter results, with analysts expecting a profit of $1.04 per share on revenue of about $11 billion.
The stock took a hit when the carrier issued lower unit revenue guidance for the fourth quarter on Jan. 10. But it has since recovered some, helped by solid results from United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL).
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) will also report earnings tomorrow morning, and there will be numbers from discount rival Southwest (NYSE:LUV).
Railroad giant  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) will report, which should give investors some idea of the impact the U.S. trade battles are having.
The stock hit a six-month nadir in late December, when pessimism about trade deals was highest, but has since recovered nicely and is up for the last three months.
On average, analysts predict UP earned $2.06 per share in the latest quarter and had revenue of more than $5.7 billion.
And drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is on tap. The company is forecast to earn 84 cents per share on sales of more than $5.9 billion.
2. Jobless Claims, Markit PMI Arrive
On the economic calendar, the latest jobless claims numbers come in tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits for the week are seen rising to 220,000 from 213,000 the week before.
In addition, Markit will issues its January PMI measures at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT).
The services PMI is forecast to edge down to 54.1 for the month, with the manufacturing PMI ticking down to 53.5.
3. Products Numbers in Focus as Well for Oil
Oil traders had to wait an extra day to get the latest weekly crude inventory numbers due to Monday’s holiday, and there’s lot of attention on tomorrow’s figures.
""The market continues to be caught between what appears to be a product glut with emphasis on gasoline and too much crude production,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker and commentator with ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, N.C.
So, the market will be focused not just on the headline of U.S. stockpiles, but on the figures on gasoline and distillates.
As of this afternoon, traders predicted U.S. stockpiles would fall by just 42,000 barrels in the latest week.
The EIA said last week that gasoline inventories rose by 7.5 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 2.77 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles increased by 2.97 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a gain of 1.57 million."

18,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Trump says U.S. doing well in trade negotiations with China,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was doing well in trade talks with China.
""I like where we are right now,"" Trump said in response to a question about trade negotiations with China by reporters at a White House event.
Trump has vowed to increase tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on March 2 unless China takes steps to protect U.S. intellectual property, end policies that force American companies to turn over technology to a Chinese partner, allow more market access for U.S. businesses and reduce other non-tariff barriers to American products.
China ""very much wants to make a deal,"" Trump said.
""We'll see what happens. But we're doing very well in our negotiations with China,"" he said.
China has repeatedly played down complaints about intellectual property abuses, and has rejected accusations that foreign companies face forced technology transfers.
Earlier on Wednesday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said he believed the United States and China could reach a trade deal by March 1.
Companies in both countries are feeling pain from the effects of U.S. tariffs and retaliation from China, which are starting to mount.

Apple Inc (O:AAPL) earlier this month rattled global markets by cutting its sales outlook, blaming weak demand in China.

19,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>","Ford Q4 Tops Street, Meets Company Guidance","Investing.com - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) reported fourth-quarter results that came in higher than Wall Street estimates Wednesday.
But shares were little changed as the results were in line with guidance the automaker provided last week.
Ford reported an adjusted profit of 30 cents per share on auto segment revenue of $38.7 billion.
On average, analysts predicted a profit of 28 cents per share on revenue of $38.1 billion.
The stock was flat in after-hours trading.
The company's pre-tax margin fell to 3.5% from 4.9% percent a year earlier.
In North America, Ford posted a pre-tax profit of $2 billion. In every other region, the automaker posted a loss. The largest loss of $381 million was in Asia, driven by China where the company has seen sales plummet.
On Jan. 15, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said they would join forces on commercial vans and pickups and were exploring joint development of electric and self-driving technology in a bid to save billions of dollars.
Ford previously said it remains committed to its money-losing operations in Europe and South America, and its losses in China would narrow this year.

20,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Texas Instruments Q4 Results Mixed; Shares Edge Up,"Investing.com - Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) reported fourth quarter earnings  that beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday, but revenue fell short of forecasts in part because of weakness in global smartphone sales.
As a result, the chip maker guided lower for the first-quarter earnings. Nonetheless investors were bidding shares slightly higher.
TI said it earned $1.26 a share on revenue of $3.72 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $1.24 on revenue of $3.75 billion. That compared to EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $3.75 billion in the 2017 fourth quarter. The company had reported EPS of $1.58 on revenue of $4.26 billion in the third quarter.
The company expects first-quarter earnings of $1.01 to $1.21 a share, down from an estimate of $1.21. Revenue was projected at $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion for the period, compared with an estimate of $3.61 billion, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
Texas Instruments shares moved up 1.2% to $96.68 in after-hours trading.
TI shares and shares of other chip companies were down in regular trading Tuesday and again on Wednesday. The culprit was a Lynx Equity Strategies forecast of weaker capital expenditures and pricing pressures.
The company said its core analog chip business saw a 4% revenue gain to $2.64 billion with a 4% operating profit increase to $1.23 billion. Its embedding processing business suffered a 12% revenue decline to $791 million with operating profit falling 24% to $234 million.
The company generates about 95% of its revenue from semiconductors and digital signal processors. The other 5% of revenues comes from the company's ubiquitous calculators.
Analog semiconductors regulate functions like temperature, speed, sound, and electrical current. TI supplies touchscreen controllers, power management chips, and a control device for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and iPads. The data the chips generate are used by digital semiconductors and, ultimately, transmitted over the Internet. TI has a 69% market share in the business.
Chipmakers globally have faced challenges in recent months arising from weaker demand, inventory adjustments and U.S.-China trade issues.
Apple this month cut its quarterly sales forecast due to poor iPhone demand in China, battering shares of chipmakers, including Texas Instruments. TI shares are down slightly this month.

Dow components IBM, United Technologies and Procter & Gamble all rallied after delivering above-consensus results, adding more than 100 points to the Dow 30 and lifting the broader market.

Still, the mostly upbeat slew of earnings firmed up the broader market, which had come under pressure following a decline in energy stocks as U.S. oil prices slipped on fears about weak oil demand growth.
The energy sector fell 1%, led by a 3% slump in oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE) ahead of its quarterly report due next week.
Sentiment on Wall Street has also been weighed down by the partial government shutdown, which entered its fifth week, with many worried about the impact on the economy.
White House Chief Economist Kevin Hassett said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that a weak first quarter and extended shutdown could lead to ""very, very low"" GDP growth.
President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to exchanged barbs, souring the prospect that both would able to reach a compromise over the president's demand for $5.7 billion to build his proposed boarder wall.
Hours after Trump said he would give the State of the Union speech in the House chamber next week as planned, Pelosi said Democrats will block the address until the partial government shutdown ends.
Uncertainty over U.S.-China trade, meanwhile, also kept investors on the sidelines despite upbeat remarks from Trump.
""We'll see what happens. But we're doing very well in our negotiations with China,"" Trump told reporters at a White House event.
Trump's upbeat remarks on trade come a day after top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied reports the U.S. had canceled a trade meeting with Chinese officials that was slated for this week.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:06PM ET</span>",Tesla to cut production hours for Model S and X,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Wednesday it is reducing production hours for higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, just days after saying it would cut jobs as the electric carmaker looks to make more affordable versions of the Model 3 sedan.
The shares of the company fell 4.2 percent to $286.09. 
Tesla also faces the unenviable choice of raising prices at the risk of losing customers or slashing costs by thousands of dollars per vehicle as the electric vehicle tax break started to phase out from earlier this month.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had said earlier this month that Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S and X to streamline production. 
""As a result of this change and because of improving efficiencies in our production lines, we have reduced Model S and X production hours accordingly,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in an email.
""These changes, along with continuing improvements, give us the flexibility to increase our production capacity in the future as needed.""
The company said it will provide more details on the earnings call scheduled for next Wednesday.
A reduction in tax credit added $3,750 to the price of Tesla's electric cars starting Jan. 1. Musk had said the need for lower-priced versions of Model 3 will become even greater from July, when the U.S. tax credit again drops in half. 
This would add $1,875 to the car's price tag. The tax credit is set to go away entirely at the end of 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors returned in force to bonds during the latest week, putting the most cash in debt markets in almost a year, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday.
Bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) snagged $9.3 billion in new cash during the week ended Jan 16, the most since late January 2018, the trade group said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and other U.S. monetary policy officials have made it clear in recent weeks that they are ready to stop raising interest rates and tightening lending conditions, a salve to investors in speculative assets.
""It speaks to an assumption that the Fed is going to take its foot off the accelerator and that growth is not going to be that bad either,"" said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco Ltd.
A resurgence in bond buying is helping corporate credit markets in 2019's first weeks after the year prior was clouded by fears that companies got in over the heads borrowing to buy other companies and to buy their own shares back.
Investors now demand just 3.2 percent in extra yield for a speculative ""BB"" rated corporate bond coming due in five years compared to a similar U.S. Treasury. That figure was 3.7 percent at the end of 2018, according to a Thomson Reuters index.
Hooper said fourth-quarter U.S. corporate earnings are beating deflated expectations, and that development is better than the alternative. Some 76 S&P 500 companies have reported earnings so far, with three quarters of them turning in profits above Wall Street's expectations.
Yet fund investors' demand for stocks was spottier during a week that included data about China's exports unexpectedly falling the most in two years in December. U.S.-based equity funds recorded $2.8 billion in withdrawals after attracting $11.3 billion the week prior.
The drop in China's exports pointed to further weakening of the world's second-largest economy and faltering global demand while Beijing and Washington negotiate a trade conflict.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 02:46PM ET</span>","Procter & Gamble bets on demand for high-end fabric, skin-care products","By Richa Naidu and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) raised its sales forecast for the year on Wednesday after quarterly results topped Wall Street expectations, boosted by price hikes and strong demand for premium fabric and skin care products. 
Premium products such as Gain or Downy fabric enhancer beads and SK-II skincare products boosted growth during the quarter, and helped P&G, the no. 1 personal care goods company, set itself apart from in-house supermarket brands that have been encroaching on market share.
Consumer goods companies have faced a string of challenges in the past year, including soaring commodities costs, a shortage of truck drivers, competition from supermarket brands and direct-to-consumer start-ups.
To counter this, P&G is cutting costs and revamping its brands and marketing strategy. The company, which makes Gillette razors and Tide detergents, has also raised prices and launched higher-end products in its beauty and fabric care businesses. 
The company's shares rose 4.5 percent to $94.55 after it posted better-than-expected second-quarter results. 
""Yet another strong quarter for P&G as execution is clearly improving, proving last quarter wasn't a fluke,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
P&G said it now expects full-year organic sales growth of 2-4 percent compared with previous guidance of 2-3 percent. Organic sales excludes items like acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
NO SIGN OF RECESSION
Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call to discuss earnings that steady results and confidence in global growth prompted the better forecast, but noted possible economic challenges such as trade, Brexit and the U.S. government shutdown. 
""We've seen nothing in purchase data, to date, and consumer behavior, to date, that would indicate that we're currently moving towards a recession,"" Moeller said. 
The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and said the risk of a sharper decline in global growth had increased.
Quarterly organic sales rose 4 percent. Analysts on average were expecting growth of 2.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Organic sales in P&G's beauty business rose 8 percent, driven by strong demand for its premium SK-II and Olay skin care brands, while feminine care business, which includes brands such as Tampax and Whisper, also witnessed high single-digit growth.
Fabric and home care business, which includes brands such as Tide and Ariel, rose 2 percent to $5.56 billion. The business is P&G's biggest contributor to sales.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.25 per share in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' estimate of $1.21 per share. Net sales rose marginally to $17.44 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $17.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In contrast, industry peer Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) said on Wednesday that its expects the environment in 2019 to remain challenging, while its quarterly profit missed expectations.

Aphria Inc. (APHA) jumped 40¢, or 6%, to $7.08 on 9.1 million shares Tuesday on news that Green Growth Brands Inc. (GGBXF) made a formal offer to acquire the Canadian cannabis producer. The stock, which has been in a steadily rising channel off its December low, pulled back for much of last week on low volume ahead of Tuesday’s breakout. There's a gap to fill at around $8 from the early December gap-down, which could get the stock to near-term targets of $8.50 and $9.25.
Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC) gained 12¢ to $43.66 on 8.8 million shares Tuesday. Stock on the Canadian marijuana producer has had a steep run-up this month before consolidating in recent sessions. A move through the November highs near $46.50 could accelerate the stock further into the low-to-mid $50s. Keep in mind that $40.50 is a triple intraday support platform from last week.
Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (KL) popped $1.30 to $27.64 on 942,400 shares Tuesday. The move to new all-time highs came on no news from the Canadian gold miner. The stock has been rallying sharply in the last two months, up 50% since mid-November, after pulling back from its August highs just below $24.

Tuesday’s advance edged the stock above lateral resistance, which could accelerate it to $33 and then $36.

E-mini S&P (March)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at 2632, down 39.50
Fundamentals: U.S. benchmarks made a U-turn ahead of the close yesterday and have grinded higher into this morning. The S&P 500 was down as much as 2% when White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow stopped the bleeding late in the session with positive comments on trade confirming next week’s fresh round of talks with China in Washington.
It was reported earlier that the White House rejected China’s preliminary offer from Friday to eliminate the trade balance over six years. The idea that the meeting itself was cancelled never gained traction. Although Kudlow provided absolutely nothing new, his upbeat comments reinvigorated the tape. The real boost came from the latest instance of false reporting minutes later. The New York Times essentially reported the imminence of a Senate funding bill being passed. Price action ripped 10 points into the close before it became clearer that the Senate will vote on two separate funding bills tomorrow, one from the Republicans and one from the Democrats, more or less as a formality with little or no hope of being passed. The reaction to headlines late last week and yesterday in both directions goes to show you how fickle this market is.
Earnings yesterday morning weighed on the tape into the afternoon but an initially negative reaction to  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) after the bell turned positive as the evening unfolded, it is up more than 6% this morning. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Procter & Gamble (PG) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) reported this morning and are up 4%, 3.5% and 3.3% respectively. The headline flow followed by strong earnings has brought a positive wave of sentiment at the onset of U.S hours.
Technicals: The S&P finds itself right in the middle of the range from Friday’s high to yesterday’s low. First key resistance comes in at 2647.25, exactly the 50% retracement. Above here, we have two waves of major three-star resistance.
Crude Oil (March)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at 53.01, down 1.03
Fundamentals: Yesterday’s selling in Crude hit its pinnacle at 9:00 am CT and price action began consolidating higher before getting a boost from comments out of the White House on U.S.-China trade relations. The broader risk-appetite expanded and led crude oil about 3% from yesterday’s early low. Overnight, China announced it will increase fiscal spending in order to counter slowing growth. This provided the latest leg, which has stalled this morning after reports that Russia’s production has inched higher in the second half of the month from 11.38 million barrels-per-day to 11.39 million barrels-per-day. Remember, in the face of growing U.S inventories, crude has rallied with OPEC jawboning playing a big role. In 2018, Russian production averaged 11.16 million barrels-per-day, in November it stood at 11.37 million barrels-per-day and in December it jumped to 11.45 million. This is a slight pullback, but from what level? The pump-all-they-can level from December? At the very least, it will be interesting to see how this plays out amongst the OPEC and non-OPEC alliance over the coming weeks.
Technicals: Yesterday’s drop tested key support.
Gold (February)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $1,283.40, up 80¢
Fundamentals: Gold continues to show vulnerability as the dollar holds ground and Treasury yields uptick on equity market strength and a more favorable global sentiment this morning. All things considered, Gold has overall held ground extremely well and this pullback was expected. The brightest spot was seen yesterday when gold did respond to unfavorable risk sentiment and equity market weakness; great to get a confirmation that the metal performs when it is supposed to. On another positive note, the Chinese yuan has strengthened this morning, which is seen as supportive to gold. We remain unequivocally bullish gold, however, prepared to see lower price action due to weak technicals.
Technicals: We have pounded the table on capitalizing on recent strength in order to welcome potential weakness. That weakness is beginning to arrive, and price action is battling key support.

43,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Shale Storm- U.S. Crude Producers Won't be Fooled Again,"Slowing growth in U.S. Shale crude oil production along with production cuts by OPEC will Trump Eurozone demand weakness and support crude bulls, writes Phil Flynn, Senior Energy Analyst, The PRICE Futures Group.
Shale oil producers are still trying to ride out the oil storm but there will be cruel cuts by U.S. shale producers. The false narrative that U.S. shale producers are immune to sharp drops in the price of oil has been proven wrong time and time again.
Shale oil producers raising output by record numbers were caught wrong footed by President Trump’s waiver of sanctions on Iran. The ensuing oil price crash hurt many of those companies and now is having consequences for expectations of U.S. shale oil output. Not only have we seen the U.S. oil rig count continue to trend lower, but Capital expenditure cuts in the sector are coming, and it is already starting to impact U.S. oil production negatively. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported the biggest one-week drop in oil rigs in three years and the Financial Times reports that the number of rigs drilling oil wells in the United States has already dropped by about 8% since November to 889, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Tuesday it expects U.S. shale production to rise by just 63,000 barrels-per-day in February, the lowest growth rate in nine months according to the Wall Street Journal. The FT reports that the EIA has forecast that between December 2018 and December 2019, U.S. crude production will rise by about 500,000 barrels-per-day. That would represent a sharp slowdown from growth of 1.8 million barrels-per-day over the previous 12 months.
This comes as the FT reports that: “Capital raising by U.S. oil exploration and production companies has fallen sharply following the decline in crude prices that began last October, pointing to cutbacks in capital spending budgets and a continuing slowdown in activity.”
The FT says that “Companies in the sector have not held a single bond sale since the start of November, according to Dealogic, while share sales have also slowed.”
 The data suggest that after a record-breaking boom in U.S. oil output in 2018, growth will be weaker this year. Many shale companies are saddled with debt and rely on debt to grow production. Lenders and investors are leery of lending many shale operations money when they still must prove that they can make money.
OPEC wants to prove they can make money and reduce the oil glut at the same time. OPEC is ahead of schedule with their cuts as their production fell by 751,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December to 31.58 million bpd, the biggest month-on-month drop in almost two years. OPEC pledged, along with Russia, to cut by 1.2 million bpd, of which OPEC’s share is 800,000 bpd.
Of course, this all hinges on whether the global economy falls apart. We saw both doom and gloom coming out of Davos. Talk of slowdown fears are making the rounds. Yet the good part of that is that global central bankers will move towards more accommodation in policies allowing for oil demand to continue to grow. The oil demand slowdown to this point has been minuscule and with shale producers cutting back and OPEC cuts going full force, the outlook is favoring the bullish side.

44,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Euro Waiting on Dovish Draghi and ECB,"The euro currency is nearing important support levels as Eurozone economic data weakens, notes Fawad Razaqzada.
The European Central Bank’s next policy decision will be made on Thursday, but the focus will undoubtedly be on ECB President Mario Draghi’s press conference. The ECB is widely expected to announce no new changes to its policy. But Draghi may deliver a cautionary outlook on the economy and therefore interest rates amid the recent weakness in German and Chinese data, and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
The euro’s recent weakness certainly suggests market participants are indeed expecting to see a more dovish than hawkish Mario Draghi. Therefore, with the expected dovishness at least partially priced in, the euro may not react too negatively if he does say what the market already expects. In fact, one has to wonder whether the risks are actually skewed to the upside for the single currency, as almost everyone appears to be bearish on the Eurozone economy and inflation outlook. Thus, any surprisingly hawkish comments from Draghi could see the euro stage a quick rebound.
Since the ECB’s last meeting on Dec. 13, Eurozone data has remained on the soft side. In fact, the latest consumer inflation data showed prices eased to 1.6% year-over-year, down from 1.9% previously, although the core Consumer Price Index remained unchanged at 1.0%. In addition, we saw some rather disappointing Eurozone manufacturing and services PMIs for December, with French PMIs falling below the boom/bust level of 50. The latest PMI data for the month of January will be released tomorrow, ahead of the ECB decision.
With Brexit uncertainly rising further and Eurozone data not improving since the ECB’s last meeting, it is hard to see how Draghi will convince the markets that interest rates will still go up, as planned, at the end of the summer. Perhaps the only good news for those concerned about a big drop in the EUR/USD exchange rate on Thursday is that the dollar hasn’t exactly been surging higher over the past couple of months. This is because the Federal Reserve has turned dovish, indicating interest rates will not be going up for a while. Obviously, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the exchange rate won’t fall sharply on Thursday, but the not-so-hawkish Fed does help limit the potential gains for the dollar, and the losses for the EUR/USD.
From a technical perspective, the EUR/USD is currently sitting above long-term support at 1.13, but it has been taking its time to move away from this level. So, it has no clear directional bias with price trading inside a very narrow range over the past several months. Obviously in recent days it has been trending lower but in the grand scheme of things, it remains more or less directionless. It will be interesting to see if, after Thursday’s ECB meeting, the EUR/USD will hold its short-term bullish trend line around 1.1350. If it loses this level, then a re-test of this month’s earlier low and the long-term support around 1.1300 could be on the cards.
The next big level below 1.1300 is last year’s low at around 1.1215. On the upside, Monday’s high around 1.1390/5 is important to hold for the bears. But if we go above it, then this could lead to a short squeeze bounce higher, possibly towards the next potential resistance at 1.1450. The next level above that is this month’s earlier high at 1.1570.
So, ahead of the ECB day, the EUR/USD is trading near a key short-term support area. Whether or not it will hold or break depends almost entirely now on the ECB. But we think the risks are skewed slightly to the upside given the level of bearishness towards the Eurozone economy and the single currency, which may be already priced in. Still, as much as I hope I am wrong, we can’t see a massive move in either direction.

45,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Cryptocurrencies- A Better Arb Trade,"Cryptocurrencies are hot and volatile. Paul Cretien provides a strategy to access the sector without opening yourself up to the extreme risk it has exhibited in 2018.
For pairs trading it’s best to use two assets that have the same economic or market base that determines their prices and price volatilities. For example, Stocks, futures, options, fixed income, exchange trade funds or foreign exchange. It helps if one of the asset classes has more price volatility than the other, but this is not required. Over time, we should find periods when one asset class — the one that is more volatile — is priced relatively high or low versus the one that is less volatile, or relatively stable.
The chart below shows the price changes for six well-known virtual currencies from January 2018 to January 2019. Two things are obvious: First, 2018 was not a pleasant time period for investors or speculators in cryptocurrencies, unless they were able to take a short since all six finished the year down more than 60%; second, the cryptocurrencies in this group moved in a well-coordinated way as if all were responding to a single force in their price changes. Since this appears to be a consistent pattern, we will assume that 2019 will show similar correlations for this group of six currencies, as well as for the cryptocurrency market in general.
The price movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum was very close for the first half of 2018 then began to diverge in July, with Bitcoin remaining stable and Ethereum dropping, creating a gap of approximately 20% from Jan. 1, 2018 (see chart below) . This divergence could have signaled a reversion trade at the height of the divergence in September 2018. A trader might have sold Bitcoin and bought Ethereum, expecting to profit when the two currencies erased the gap in their price changes.
Over short time periods, we might expect the stable asset – for example, Lite Coin vs. Steller Lumens (see chart below) — to remain calm and not change drastically. With this assumption it would be possible to profit more by simply buying or selling the volatile member of the pair and expecting its price to move in the direction of the asset with the more stable price. This technique depends on the distance between the volatile and stable members of the pair to show the possible profit from buying or selling the asset that is more volatile. It is a basic reversion trade.
One reason why the new approach – trading only the more volatile member of a pair – should be profitable is that all of the currencies are moving together. This correlation is more than a pair, it is a cryptocurrency crowd. Bringing the volatile currency back into line could be called “crowd control.”
Cryptocurrencies represent an anomaly for traders. They want access to a hot and volatile market, but they are afraid of the volatility. Pairs trading of cryptocurrencies may be the answer. They can take a position in an outlier currency and hedge with a more stable crypto. This way they can access investing in a new and exciting sector, without buying the sector."
46,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: Capital One Loses Its Street Cred Amid 'Confidence Shaking' Results,"Investing.com -  Capital One  slumped, dragging financials lower, after it delivered quarterly results that spooked the sell-side community.
Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), on Tuesday after the close, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.87 a share on $7 billion in revenue, missing expectations for earnings of $2.38 a share and $7.08 billion. Its shares fell 5.6%.
The results prompted bearish calls from analysts as Nomura lowered its price target on company's stock to $90 and said the results were ""confidence shaking,"" citing disappointing revenue growth and elevated expenses.
Oppenheimer downgraded its investment rating on Capital One to perform from outperform.
""We find it less likely investors see the outsized benefits from pent-up account growth and funding cost reduction in the near term,"" Oppenheimer said.
But financial services company Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) was rewarded for delivering above-consensus fourth-quarter results and revealing that it had extended its relationship with Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Its share price soared 11%.
For the fourth quarter, earnings increased to $1.09 a share on $4.40 billion in revenue, well above analysts' estimates for earnings of $0.92 a share on $4.28 billion in revenue.
Synchrony said it extended its partnership with Walmart's Sam's Club and reached an agreement to sell the Walmart loan portfolio that it currently services. Walmart has agreed to dismiss a lawsuit against Synchrony.
Some on Wall street, however, remained bearish.
""We agree these are positives for Synchrony, but they do not contradict our expectations of slowing spending and deteriorating credit in 2019, which we think will weigh on shares,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) ETF was down 0.5%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Citadel has hired Gilberto Marcheggiano from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management to join its global macro strategy team to help build a unit that takes financial positions based on forecasts about major macro events, sources told Reuters.
Marcheggiano, 32, will join in February as a London-based portfolio manager focusing primarily on Citadel's discretionary macro investments in G10 markets, the sources said.
Macro strategies portfolio managers use anything from forecasts of interest rates to government policies or political changes to make decisions on whether to take long or short positions in financial markets.
Marcheggiano worked for six years at Goldman Sachs Asset Management where he was a managing director and was named head of cross macro investments in 2017.
Marcheggiano, who has also worked at the Bank of England as an economist, would report to Citadel's macro strategies head Colin Lancaster who is leading the push into the business.
Lancaster has been on a hiring spree since joining Citadel at the end of 2017 and launching the macro strategies unit in 2018.
Other recent senior hires include New York-based senior portfolio managers Marco Birch and Eric Dannheim and London-based head of quantitative research for macro strategies Jerome Lebuchoux.
Macro strategies is one of two fixed income and macro businesses that manage capital for Citadel's multi-strategy hedge funds.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) beat Wall Street profit and revenue estimates on Wednesday as its high-speed internet business grew and it lost fewer cable subscribers than expected.
Comcast's fourth quarter showed that fears over ""cord cutting"" in cable services and slower broadband growth may be overstated, analysts said.
The results also reinforced why Comcast's NBCUniversal news and entertainment arm has announced a streaming strategy that appears less disruptive to traditional television and movie businesses than services planned by AT&T Inc (N:T) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS). 
""We've always thought that the television ecosystem was healthier than maybe some people thought,"" NBCUniversal Chief Executive Stephen Burke told analysts in a conference call.
Shares in the top U.S. cable services provider were up nearly 4 percent in midday trading. Comcast also said it would raise its dividend by 10 percent to 84 cents per share. 
NBCUniversal in January announced an advertising-supported streaming TV service that will launch in 2020. 
Unlike Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), which charges a monthly fee and is seen as a threat to traditional pay television, NBC's streaming service will be free for its pay-TV customers. It will initially be available to about 50 million customers and expand as NBC negotiates with other pay-TV providers. 
Comcast said it lost 29,000 video customers in the quarter, less than the 33,000 it lost last year and the 62,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet. Revenue slipped 1.6 percent to $5.58 billion.
Revenue from Comcast's high-speed internet business climbed 10 percent to $4.4 billion as the company added 351,000 net subscribers, up from 350,000 a year earlier. Still, the net subscriber additions fell short of the average analyst estimate of 356,000.
""Forgive us for wondering aloud why the market thinks cable is somehow a doomed business,"" analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, said in a report after the results. ""It’s hard to imagine a better testimony to the strength and resilience of the cable model.""
On the media side, business was also growing. NBCUniversal reported a 7.1 percent rise in revenue to $9.40 billion.
Filmed entertainment revenue rose 14 percent, boosted by movies including ""The Grinch"", while theme park revenue increased 3.6 percent to $1.51 billion. Revenue from broadcast television rose nearly 4 percent $3.10 billion.
Comcast, which beat Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in an auction for Sky, said revenue reported from the British pay-TV group was $4.59 billion. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $5.02 billion.
Overall, Comcast revenue jumped 26 percent to $27.85 billion in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $28.28 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $27.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned 64 cents per share, above the average estimate of 62 cents per share.

Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.51 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $15.00 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $12.7 billion one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the family-backed French spirits group under pressure from activist investor Elliott, said on Wednesday it named business veteran Patricia Barbizet to the newly created role of Lead Independent director to further improve its governance.
The board of directors also approved the departure of longtime family ally and former CEO Pierre Pringuet from his current role as vice-chairman of the board.
Pringuet will however stay on as a board director, the company said in a statement.
""The decision taken by the board to create the role of Lead Independent Director is the continuity of a thought-process that started in July 2018,"" Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard said.
It followed ""the triennial external review of the board and the feeback we've received from our long-term shareholders,"" he added.
The move also comes after activist fund Elliott disclosed in December it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) to build a stake of just over 2.5 percent in the world's second-biggest spirits maker. 
Elliott has called on the maker of Martell cognac and Jameson whiskey to raise profit margins to bring them more in line with larger rival  Diageo  (L:DGE) and improve governance.
In particular, it believes Pernod's 15-member board needs to be more diverse and have more independent voices, as many directors are linked to the Ricard family.

GE has opened negotiations to trim its staff in France under a ""collective mutually agreed termination"" agreement, a measure introduced in France in September 2017. An early retirement plan is also on the table, union officials said.
""In a particularly difficult time for the power sector, GE is currently reviewing its businesses to ensure they are best fitted to market reality and ensure their success,"" the company said.
Some 229 jobs could be cut at  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) Power Systems (APS), including 146 at GE Energy's European headquarters in Belfort, eastern France, unions said.
Another 149 jobs could go at GE Energy Power Conversion France and 90 at GE Grid, they said.
GE employs 16,000 people in France, including 6,000 in the power branch.
When it bought Alstom's energy business, GE had committed to maintain jobs for at least three years in France and create 1,000 net new jobs by the end of 2018.
The French government brandished the threat of fines in June 2018 after former GE Chief Executive John Flannery told Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire that the company would fail to create as many jobs as promised.

A meeting on that issue is expected to take place at the finance ministry in coming weeks, a GE spokesman said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Fiat Chrysler diesel owners have asked a U.S. judge to approve up to $106.5 million in legal fees and out-of-pocket costs for a settlement over excess vehicle emissions.
The attorneys said in a filing late Tuesday they had reviewed more than 4 million pages of documents and were involved in almost 100 depositions as they seek up to $99.5 million in legal fees and $7 million in costs.
The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it settled civil claims with the U.S. Justice Department, the state of California and diesel owners that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests. 
Fiat Chrysler estimated the value of the settlements at about $800 million, a figure that could potentially rise to more than $900 million with the legal fees. A court hearing on the settlement is scheduled for later on Wednesday in San Francisco. 
The settlement includes $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, and extended warranties worth $105 million.
German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which provided the emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners.
Under the settlement, the $307.5 million from Fiat Chrysler and Bosch will give owners an average of $2,800 to get diesel software updates. 
The settlement covers 104,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels from the model years 2014 to 2016, said the U.S. Justice Department, which is also conducting a criminal probe.
The settlement also includes $72.5 million for state civil penalties, and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims.
The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules. 
Fiat Chrysler will be required to work with vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters in the 47 states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. Justice Department officials have estimated that effort will cost $50 million to $70 million.

Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used “defeat devices” to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving, Fiat Chrysler did not admit liability.

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by a more than 20 percent sales surge at its aerospace businesses, sending the industrial conglomerate's shares higher.
Like other major U.S. manufacturers, UTC, a maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators, has benefited from a boom in air travel and record global sales of commercial jets.
Revenue growth of 24 percent and 29 percent, respectively, at Pratt & Whitney and airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), bode well for a planned split next year, whittling down the company to its core aerospace businesses and spinning off the others.
""We are seeing really solid trends in aerospace across the board, with continued (airline traffic) growth and production increases at both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said on a call.
The plan to split into three parts was greeted with skepticism by investors when it was unveiled last November along with the completion of its purchase of Collins. Shares have fallen 14 percent since.
Wednesday's results pushed shares up as much as 7.4 percent.
Analysts said the strong results and full-year forecast was likely to boost confidence in UTC's ability to improve cash generation and profit ahead of the breakup next year.
""Expectations were low, the stock has underperformed and we believe that street estimates for 2019 (earnings per share) should rise by 5 to 10 cents,"" Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe said.
The company forecast 2019 adjusted earnings per share between $7.70 and $8.00, the mid-point of which is well above the average estimate of $7.80, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Collins' earnings contribution in 2019 is now expected to be 35 cents per share, up from 15 to 25 cents per share previously, largely helped by a better operating performance.
The company expects 2019 sales growth in a range of low to high single digits across all its businesses. 
While Otis has suffered in the past from issues around Chinese demand, the company said continued infrastructure spending by the Chinese government would help Otis as well as Carrier in the quarters ahead.
""We do believe that the government's focus on infrastructure spending is going to help the market overall. It's in their interest to try to get the gross domestic product growth above six percent,"" Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said.
On an adjusted basis, United Technologies earned $1.95 per share, above estimates of $1.53.

Net sales rose 15.1 percent to $18.04 billion, beating estimates of $16.91 billion.

82,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Bank of Italy official says Carige offers strengths for buyer,"MILAN (Reuters) - A top Bank of Italy official said on Wednesday he hoped that Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) could find a merger partner within a reasonable time and added the troubled bank had strengths which could benefit a potential buyer.
Bank of Italy's Deputy Governor Fabio Panetta told a parliamentary hearing that a merger was the best solution for Carige, which faces a state bailout if it fails to find a buyer.
The European Central Bank put Carige under special administration this month after its top shareholder blocked a planned capital raising in December. 
Italy's government has set up a 1.3 billion euro fund to prop up the bank and has granted it a state guarantee to sell debt. But it could also be called to inject capital under a so-called precautionary recapitalization scheme.
Italy's Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Wednesday a market solution for Carige was preferable, but the government was ready to deal with other situations.
Rome is considering merging Carige, and fellow troubled lender Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), with stronger rivals, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
UBS is helping Carige look for a buyer, but the bank's chief executive said earlier this month that crucial elements such as its cost of capital were still unclear.
Panetta said Carige had strengths that could be exploited by a buyer, such as a total capital ratio of 12-13 percent which could rise to 17-18 percent if it were taken over by another bank, due to a different assessment of asset risks.

""So looking for a partner is not a fanciful thought"".

The statement came in response to a Bloomberg report that said the U.S. Federal Reserve was investigating Deutsche Bank's role in the Danske scandal.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement that there were no probes. ""But we received several requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world,"" it said. The bank also said it continued to provide information to and cooperate with the investigating agencies. 
""It is not surprising at all that the investigating authorities and banks themselves have an interest in the Danske case and the lessons to be learned from it,"" Deutsche Bank said.
The Fed's probe is at an early stage, Bloomberg said, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.
The U.S. central bank is investigating whether Deutsche Bank in New York properly monitored the transfer of funds it performed on behalf of Danske from its Estonia branch, the report added.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment.
Deutsche Chief Executive Christian Sewing said last week that the bank was investigating the Danske case internally and that it had no indication of any misconduct on the bank's part.
Danske is under investigation for suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($227 billion) from 2007 until 2015. Deutsche Bank has said it acted as a correspondent bank for Dankse Bank in Estonia.
A Deutsche Bank executive director has said the German bank played only a secondary role as a correspondent bank to Danske, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions.
In 2017, the Fed was among regulators that fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the case is still ongoing.
In November, police searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank's board as part of a two-day raid and investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers.
Deutsche Bank has said it had no indication of misconduct in this case.
In September, German regulator BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and appointed accounting firm KPMG as a third party to assess progress.
Deutsche shares recouped earlier losses to trade up 0.1 percent late afternoon in Frankfurt, roughly in line with Germany's DAX index (GDAXI), which was up 0.2 percent.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>","Former Barclays bosses hid 322 million pounds in Qatar fees in 2008, court told","By Kirstin Ridley and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Four former  Barclays  (L:BARC) executives conspired to commit fraud by hiding 322 million pounds of payments to Qatar in return for cash injections in 2008, a prosecutor alleged at the opening of one of London's most high-profile criminal trials.
Former chief executive John Varley and three former directors are the most senior bankers to be prosecuted in Britain over events during the financial crisis, when Barclays avoided a state bailout by raising more than 11 billion pounds from mainly Gulf investors in two cash calls.
Opening the case for the Serious Fraud Office prosecutor, senior lawyer Edward Brown alleged that the bank's Advisory Service Agreements (ASAs), through which Qatar was paid 322 million pounds ($419.66 million) in 2008, were a “dishonest mechanism” to conceal extra fees from other investors and the wider market.
""It is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case...,"" he told the jury at London's Southwark Crown Court in a courtroom so packed that reporters had to request tickets to gain entry.
""(The ASAs) were devised by the conspirators as mechanism for paying the Qataris greater fees than those paid to other investors so as not to reveal the true position ...,” Brown told the court in a trial scheduled to last up to six months.
Varley, 62, in an open-necked shirt and jumper, listened in the glass-surrounded dock, flanked by Roger Jenkins, in a polo neck jumper and jacket, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, both wearing suits.
They are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Varley and Jenkins face two counts and Kalaris and Boath face one. They all deny the charges.
Varley and Jenkins, the 63-year-old former head of Barclays' Middle Eastern arm, are charged with two counts of conspiring dishonestly with former finance director Christopher Lucas to make misleading or untrue representations in documents published in relation to both the June and October capital raisings.
Kalaris, 63, who ran Barclays' wealth management business, and Boath, a 60-year-old former head of the corporate finance division, face one count over the June 2008 cash call. Both charges allege the men were either seeking to profit or to cause or expose others to losses.
Lucas, who is suffering from ill-health, has not been charged.
The case hinges on what the bank disclosed in its public statements in 2008; the prospectuses for the capital raisings and subscription agreement documents published that June and October, which outlined fees and commissions paid to investors in return for backing the bank.
Prosecutors allege that Barclays thought it essential to secure a deal with Qatar in early 2008 as markets roiled, but that the Gulf state drove a hard bargain.
Qatar initially demanded a fee of 3.75 percent before settling on 3.25 percent in return for investing in the bank - more than double what Barclays was paying other investors, the prosecution alleged.
Unwilling to risk other investors demanding the same terms - or appearing financially unstable by being seen to pay too high a price - the executives played a part in false representations to the market, the prosecution alleged.
Brown said some defendants relied on the fact that lawyers had sanctioned the use of ASAs by signing off on them, as their defense in the case. But he alleged lawyers were told the ASAs were genuinely designed to represent services provided by Qatar and that they were separate from the Qatari investment in Barclays.
""The truth is that the lawyers did not approve of the use of the ASAs as mechanisms to hide the commission fees paid to the Qataris,"" he said.
Qatar, which has not been accused of wrongdoing, plowed around 4.0 billion pounds into Barclays in 2008, Brown said.
The trial continues this week.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Sahm Adrangi, who cemented his reputation with successful bets against Chinese internet companies, said that he has taken a short position against  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), arguing the chip supplier's stock price could shrink by half.
Adrangi's hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital published a research paper that suggests Qualcomm's profits could be at risk as the company faces lawsuits, especially one in the United States.
If the company loses to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Kerrisdale said that Qualcomm would be forced to ""license core patents to competitors and to renegotiate all of its existing licenses on fair terms.""
That would create a ""period of immense confusion and uncertainty about Qualcomm’s prospects - and ... could realistically cut Qualcomm's licensing revenue, earnings power, and stock price in half,"" the report says.
The Federal Trade Commission filed its case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is alleging that Qualcomm's patent licensing and chip sale practices were anticompetitive and sought to preserve a monopoly on so-called premium LTE modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data network.
""In the past Qualcomm has been able to keep its business model going, but this time the threats are far more severe,"" Adrangi said. Previous legal troubles cost the company money.
A judgment against the company in this case could force an overhaul of its business model, the hedge fund argues. ""As Qualcomm’s long-running game of monopoly draws to a close, there will be no 'Get Out of Jail Free' card,"" the report said.
Kerrisdale is arguing that Judge Lucy Koh, who is presiding over the case, has already ruled against the company on several matters and may be inclined to rule for the FTC.
Qualcomm's stock traded at $54.16 on Tuesday and Kerrisdale sees a chance for it to fall by half in the next year or two.
The company has a market capitalization of $66 billion and its stock is owned by mutual fund companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity. 

Kerrisdale is a New York- based hedge fund managing roughly $150 million in assets. But it has taken on big targets before, including satellite communications company Globalstar. It has a large social media presence and boasts a 37 percent gain in 2018, far better than the average hedge fund which lost roughly 4.5 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Selling pounds has been a favorite game of the $5.1 trillion-a-day global currency market for over two years. But as the Brexit endgame plays out and 'worst case' scenarios ebb, market metrics and dynamics show sterling may have weathered the storm. 
Since late-December, investors who normally rely on weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to gauge positioning in major currencies have flown blind, as the U.S. government shutdown prevents the release of the figures. 
The CFTC figures, the closest proxy to changes in investor positioning, showed that speculators had a net $4.84 billion short position on the pound versus the dollar on Dec. 21 -- the last date on which data was available. 
(Graphic: GBP CFTC Positions - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RYg6NK)
As a measure of bets on sterling to weaken, that was off a $6.5 billion net short touched in September 2018. It has likely been cut even further since then, even if the overall bias remains negative, various data sources examined by Reuters show. 
Without CFTC data, banks' internal flows may provide the clearest glimpse into position shifts and data compiled by some of the biggest institutions --  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Scotiabank  (TO:BNS) -- indicate pound positions have seen some big swings since the data was shut off.
BNP Paribas's FX positioning tracker, for instance, shows that on a scale of +50/-50, sterling 'shorts' had been pared back in the week to Jan. 21 for a score of minus 18, versus minus 23 the previous week. The score had ended 2018 at minus 30.
Similarly,  RBC  Capital Markets' quant trading team reckons that, when compared to the largest ever short sterling position versus the dollar hit in October 2016, investors are currently only short around 19 percent of that level. 
Net shorts were a third of the record level at the end of 2018. Against the euro, markets are actually now long sterling on a net basis, RBC said. 
Another index, compiled by currency fund Millennium Global Investments, shows pound positioning at just minus 0.3 on a scale of -5/+5. It was minus 1.7 a month ago.
(Graphic: GBP positioning vs GBP spot - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HuNCHh)
""The question is how quickly sterling positioning is being rebuilt, based on potential for a second referendum, a general election or just softer Brexit,"" said Claire Dissaux, Millennium's head of global economics and strategy. 
""Most (investors), if not all, have decreased the possibility of disorderly Brexit which has shifted sentiment towards sterling."" 
Banks' flow indicators are based on a mix of sales trading flow they see from their various clients, data from their quantitative trading teams and other derivative markets data.
FLOWS 
The position changes stem from growing conviction in markets the UK parliament will not allow a ""hard"" or no deal Brexit, and could force a second referendum, delaying or even reversing Brexit. That view is reflected in flows tracked by banks -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch for instance found that hedge funds as well as ""real"" money piled into sterling in the past week.
Hedge funds are already long sterling, BAML estimates.
(Graphic: Hedge Funds Turn bullish on the pound - https://tmsnrt.rs/2S4isum)
""Markets are pricing out the probability of a no-deal Brexit and that has boosted the pound in recent days and we see strong demand for the British currency below $1.2850 levels,"" Kamal Sharma, BAML's director of G10 FX strategy said.
Chances of a Brexit delay have grown further as the opposition Labour Party indicated it would back a legislative amendment which would extend the exit process until end-2019.
Data from Refinitiv shows steady selling of the euro against the pound -- the cleanest currency pair for those wanting to trade Brexit headlines -- for most of January. The selling pressure has accelerated over the last week or so, data showed.
(Graphic: EURGBP trades - https://tmsnrt.rs/2T4bC5o)
The unwinding of shorts is also reflected in option markets -- investors' favored way for many months to protect against a weakening pound. But traders now report growing demand to flip those positions and hedge against further sterling gains over the months ahead.
Sterling risk reversals -- a gauge of expectations for a currency's direction measured by comparing the relative cost of options to buy and to sell the pound  show the premium on calls, or options to buy, on one-month contracts recently hit seven-month highs.
(Graphic: Sterling risk reversals - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hhc4vS)
One implication of the short position snapback is that sterling may be running out of steam to appreciate without further positive news on the Brexit front - the shorter the positioning, the greater the rebound.
And with Prime Minister Theresa May battling to break a parliamentary deadlock, fears of no-deal Brexit haven't entirely faded either. 
So while the pound  has rallied more than 4 percent off 21-month lows around $1.24 hit earlier this month, it remains more than 10 percent below a 2018 high of $1.43. 
A number of financial advisors have urged clients not to overestimate their ability to make bets on British politics. 
Some large institutional investors also are also cautious.
James Bateman, CIO at Fidelity International, said neutral was his preferred stance for now. 

""We have powder dry ready to deploy by being neutral,"" he said. ""We can take advantage of a move in either direction.""

They have been striking against the services, which offer rides that undercut taxi prices online rather than being hailed in the street, since Monday, complaining that regulations are being ignored with unfair competition.
In September, Spain's government gave the ride-hailing companies four years to comply with regulations granting them just one new license for every 30 taxi licenses.

Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, said he sees a more negative outlook for growth than the markets and policy makers.
“While people have certainly diminished their growth expectations and you’re hearing all about that at Davos, we don’t think they’ve done it enough,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Wednesday from the World Economic Forum. “Earnings expectations particularly in the U.S. are too high, and generally the Fed and other policy makers are still expecting stronger growth than we see.”
Jensen, who helps oversee the world’s biggest hedge fund at Bridgewater, said that he expects to see lower interests rates, particularly on the short-end of the Treasury curve. Regions that have priced in high growth expectations will be hurt the most. On the other hand, some emerging markets that have already suffered from the U.S.’s tighter monetary policy will benefit as policy makers resume easing, he said.
European markets will be the first test, he said, as the region is “starting from a worse level in terms of the economy, lower inflation -- close to deflation in many places -- and already have negative interest rates,” Jensen said. “Their movement will be kind of a leading indicator because they’re going to struggle more with easing” than the U.S. or China, which have “more tools available to them.”
In December, Jensen said growth in 2019 would be near recession levels at about 1 percent in the U.S., and slightly lower for the rest of the developed world. Jensen said cash continues as a viable alternative to U.S. stocks and bonds.
As the annual summit got underway on Tuesday, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio chastised monetary policy makers for an “inappropriate desire” to tighten monetary policy faster than the capital markets could handle, but expressed hope that they were now looking to shift more slowly.
Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater oversees about $160 billion in assets. Its flagship hedge fund strategy Pure Alpha rose 14.6 percent in 2018. The macro manager trades globally across more than 150 markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets recovered from earlier losses on Wednesday as investors made a cautious return to riskier assets, with U.S. futures and European stocks higher even as worries about corporate and economic growth lingered.
Trading was choppy as hopes of more stimulus measures from China to shore up its economy offset worries over progress between Washington and Beijing in resolving their trade spat.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was back in positive territory around midday in London.
U.S. futures pointed to a positive start for Wall Street after the heaviest losses in nearly three weeks in the wake of disappointing earnings.
Pan-European stocks were up 0.4 percent at 1322 GMT. 
The main driver of the earlier risk-off tone was a Financial Times report that Washington had rejected an offer from Beijing for preparatory trade talks this week ahead of high-level negotiations scheduled for next week.
""Even though the Trump administration later denied the report, the damage had been done to sentiment,"" said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks MacDonald.
A thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions has fueled a rally in stocks through much of January, also supported by a more dovish-sounding Federal Reserve.
A fresh batch of weak corporate updates from European companies including luxury goods brand Burberry and Ingenico knocked confidence about fourth-quarter earnings.
""If earnings come in reasonably around expectations, the reality is equities are attractively valued across global regions,"" said James Bateman, chief investment officer of multi asset at Fidelity International.
""If they disappoint consistently there is going to be a real reappraisal of fair value.""
European companies are expected to report an average 4.8 percent rise in earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter, a decrease from the 6 percent expected last week, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
Most euro zone bond yields fell after the Bank of Japan set the tone for further easing by warning of rising risks to its economy ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting. 
Markets expect the ECB to acknowledge growing threats to the euro zone economy. The dollar was lower against a basket of other currencies.
ROUGH YEAR AHEAD?
Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General said central banks' unwinding of stimulus, China's slowdown, the broader impact of trade wars and populist rhetoric from politicians were keeping markets on edge.
""All these issues have an impact ... Every time you have an increase in rhetoric, markets react. It feels like there is a greater political risk premium.
""The biggest near-term risk is that as you see markets fall, confidence drops and you get people not spending which becomes self-perpetuating. The near-term probability of that has increased.""
Recent data has pointed to a rough year ahead for the world economy.
U.S. home sales tumbled 6.4 percent in December to their lowest in three years. Compared with a year earlier, they were down more than 10 percent for the first time since 2011.
House price increases slowed sharply, adding to evidence of a further loss of momentum in the housing market.

Einhorn told investors about his plans at the firm's annual investor day on Tuesday at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
Greenlight's main fund lost 34 percent last year, while the average stock-oriented hedge fund lost about 7 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
Investors pulled money out last year and Greenlight began 2019 with roughly $2.5 billion in assets. The fund, which had been closed to new investors for years, now plans to take in new capital, the source said.
There will be no marketing campaign, however, and potential investors would need to contact Greenlight to get into the fund.

LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar is preparing to issue a tender for energy firms seeking a stake in its gas expansion project, drawing interest from long-standing partners as well as newcomers  Chevron , Norway's Equinor and Italy's Eni, industry sources said.
Plans to expand Qatar's liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, already the world's largest, by more than a third in the next five years are considered one of the most lucrative investments in the rapidly growing global gas market.
Competition is expected to be fierce.
The huge interest underscores how successfully the small Gulf country positioned itself in the face of a boycott imposed in 2017 by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which accuse Doha of supporting terrorism and their enemy Iran. Qatar denies the charge.
Qatar's state-run oil and gas company has in recent weeks held talks with several foreign energy firms that want to help build the new LNG facilities, four sources close to the discussions said.
Qatar Petroleum (QP) is preparing to issue a tender seeking partners to invest in the construction of a fourth LNG train, or production line, that will see its capacity grow to 110 million tonnes a year (mtpa) from the current 78 mtpa. 
The four companies that hold stakes in Qatar's existing LNG facilities -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) - are widely expected to bid, according to the sources.
Exxon, Shell, Total and Conoco declined to comment. Total and Conoco have said in the past that they hope to play a role in the expansion.
A number of newcomers are also set to join the race.
Officials from Chevron (N:CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, have held talks in Doha in recent weeks and are considering bidding for a stake in the expansion, the sources said.
A Chevron spokeswoman declined to comment.
Norway's national oil company Equinor (OL:EQNR) is considering submitting an offer as it seeks to expand its global LNG operations, which have lagged those of rivals, sources close to the company said.
An Equinor spokesman said: ""We continue to assess business development opportunities globally, but we don't have any comments on specific regions.""
Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) plans to play a role in the project, Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi recently said. Eni and QP bolstered ties in recent years after QP acquired from Eni stakes in three offshore blocks in Mexico.
One Chinese state-owned company is also in the process, the sources said.
Brazilian oil and gas company Petrobras considered bidding but in recent weeks decided against it, the sources said.
Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment.

""Qatar's planned LNG expansion is one of the global standout opportunities in 2019,"" consultancy WoodMackenzie said.
""Partner selection is ongoing, and we expect awards to be made in advance of FID (final investment decision) in 2020 ... The upstream segment alone is a world-class asset and operators will struggle to find other low-cost opportunities of this scale,"" it added.
""QP is unlikely to sole risk the development and will seek partners. However, suitors will need to prove they can add value to win a stake. We expect to see all the incumbents, primarily the majors, jostling for position.""

105,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Big U.S. Banks Are Letting Stress Tests Make Decisions for Them,"(Bloomberg) -- If you’re a bond trader at a major bank, the next time you ask for an increase in your position limit, the answer is likely to be based on regulatory stress tests.
Seventy-eight percent of global banks now use the tests to assess concentrations and set limits internally, according to a Deloitte survey to be released Wednesday. That’s up from 67 percent in 2012, the first time the same question was posed. Eighty-seven percent of respondents said they use capital stress tests for strategy and business planning, up from 68 percent seven years ago.
The tests are a post-crisis phenomenon, first started by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2009 to help restore confidence in the biggest banks, which had previously used their own formulas for allocating capital to different businesses and setting limits for trading desks. After the crisis, the tests replaced banks’ own calculations in how regulators set minimum capital requirements -- and are now playing a bigger role in internal strategic decisions too.
“Over the last decade, regulators’ stress tests have been increasingly used by bank executives to evaluate the impact of big decisions on the business,” Edward Hida, a partner with Deloitte’s risk-advisory unit and author of the firm’s global risk-management survey, said in an interview. “Banks may need to run these stress tests even more frequently -- and especially when the market has such violent and volatile market swings as we’re facing now.”
Stress tests even influence most of the firms’ merger decisions, according to the Deloitte survey. The number of respondents saying so rose to 55 percent last year from 27 percent in 2012. The latest survey was conducted between March and July among 94 financial institutions around the world. More than 60 percent were banks, but insurance and investment-management firms also took part.
Cybersecurity is seen as a risk that would increase most in importance over the next two years, the Deloitte survey also found. Sixty-seven percent of respondents picked it as among the top three risks, while 40 percent placed it at No. 1.
The largest banks have been spending close to $1 billion each to beef up their cyber defenses as high-profile breaches in every industry have increased public and executives’ awareness. In a survey released in December, 84 percent of U.S. financial firms said they expected to increase their cybersecurity spending in coming years.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian arm of U.S. bank Citi (N:C) said on Wednesday it planned to reduce the number of its offices in the country, but expected to do more business this year.
Foreign banks in Russia have been under pressure since Western countries began imposing sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Many foreign banks were forced to significantly cut their exposure to Russia. 
But as some of the banks adjusted to the new circumstances, they started to grow in fields not covered by the sanctions. 
Michael Berner, a Citi Russia board member and its consumer business manager, said on Wednesday the bank would reduce its number of branches from 22 to 15 in Russia by the end of the year to try to further move its client-base online, the Interfax news agency reported. 
Citi said in a presentation on Wednesday its Russian assets under management had grown 24 percent last year, with the number of retail client accounts and deposits up 8 percent year on year.
""We think these results are positive and we are planning to keep that same growth rate this year,"" Berner said.
The Russian banking market is dominated by large, state-owned companies. They make up almost 70 percent of Russian bank assets and five large banks control 60 percent of the assets, according to the World Bank. 
Citi Russia, which has been in the country since 1992 and is its 21 largest bank by assets, said the competition from state-owned players would not affect its business. 
""Do we feel the strengthening of state banks? No, because we have a clearly-defined strategy and a clearly-defined segment in which we operate,"" said Maria Ivanova, president of Citi Russia. 

Russia's central bank has said the country needs to increase competition in the financial sector.

Spak downgraded Tesla to underperform from sector perform, saying the challenges of the scaling up and delivering a large volume of cars at high prices and margins are coming to a head. The analyst also lowered his price target on the stock to $245 from $290.
“Given 2019 deliveries are likely to be close to fourth-quarter 2018 run-rate, but with a price/mix headwind, third-quarter 2018 may have been peak profitability this decade,” Spak said. The company’s recent decision to lower the prices of its cars by $2,000 to offset the effect of a gradually phasing out federal tax incentive confirmed RBC’s view that the bulk of demand is at a lower price point that Tesla can’t yet access profitably.
Tesla plans to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30. Last week, the company said it had managed to eke out a profit in the final three months of 2018, even as it warned of a “difficult” road ahead.

110,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 07:39AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Starbucks SBUX,"For investors that are comfortable with a bit more risk, consider snapping up a few shares of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) as a corporate turnaround play, explains Mike Larson, editor of Safe Money Report.
This is looking increasingly like a new bear market. It’s not 100% confirmed, at least technically speaking. But as I like to say, if it looks like a bear, smells like a bear, and acts like a bear, what else could it be?
That doesn’t mean we won’t be able to find any profit opportunities. There are also going to be stocks that buck the trend because they offer the right combination of defensiveness, dividend yield, and lower volatility.
With that in mind, there is one opportunity worth targeting — Starbucks (SBUX). The coffee chain operator struggled for most of the past couple years. But its shares soared 12% on Nov. 2, 2018 — the biggest one-day gain since 2009.
The catalyst was SBUX’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. It showed comparable sales growth of 4% in the Americas region, improved loyalty program growth, a rebound in Chinese sales, spending reductions and other positive metrics.
Throw in Starbucks' market-beating dividend yield of 2.1%, its solid Weiss ""buy"" Rating and the fact my two teenage daughters seem to spend half their lives and most of their money there — and you have the makings of a very interesting long-term investment.
If you can get an entry price around $60, that would be ideal. But be sure to buckle up. Markets are going to be in for a bumpy ride this year.

111,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Antero Midstream AMGP,"My aggressive stock pick for 2019 is Antero Midstream GP LP (AMGP); this is an energy midstream services company in transition, notes Tim Plaehn, income specialist and editor of The Dividend Hunter.
The company came to market with a May 2017 IPO. The assets at that time were general partner incentive distribution rights — IDRs — for an ownership interest in high growth, midstream MLP, Antero Midstream Partners (AM).
The MLP was sponsored and controlled by Marcellus natural gas producer Antero Resources (NAR). Complicated, multi-publicly traded entity structures were the vogue in the energy sector until energy commodity prices and energy sector stock prices crashed in 2015-2016.
Over the last two years (2017-2018) the MLP sector, related infrastructure stocks, and their sponsor companies have announced simplification events to hopefully make the resulting business structures and forecast results more appealing to investors.
On October 10, 2018 the Antero companies announced a simplification transaction that will close in the first quarter or 2019. The transaction involves AMGP acquiring all the AM units, and then changing its name to Antero Midstream and using the AM stock symbol.
For now, call the resulting company new AM. The effect of the transaction will be to turn the current Antero Midstream Partners into a C-Corp and the elimination of the IDRs paid to the general manager. This means starting in 2019, the current AMGP, which derives its revenue from the IDR payments will change into a high dividend growth midstream services provider. This discussion is about the soon-to-be Antero Midstream Corporation — new AM.
Antero Midstream will be a roughly $10 billion market cap energy midstream company focused on natural gas gathering and compression for Antero Resources in the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. The company also provides wellhead water services (fresh water delivery and waste water takeaway) and owns one take away natural gas pipeline. Currently about 65% of EBITDA is from gathering and compression, with the remaining 35% from water services.
The growth of AM revenues depends on production growth from Antero Resources. Antero is the largest natural gas liquids — NGLs — producer in the U.S., across all energy production areas. The exploration and production company hold the largest core, liquids rich inventory of production sites in Appalachia.
Of the undrilled locations in the region, Antero has rights to 40% of the total. Production growth from Antero Resources is forecast to generate 50% compounding annual gathering and processing volume growth through 2021.
This growth in throughput will fuel cash flow and distribution growth for Antero Midstream. The company projects 27% annual distribution growth through 2021. The midpoint of dividend guidance for new AM in 2019 is $1.24 per share. The AMGP Q3 dividend annualized is $0.576 per share.
With a mid-teen share price at the end of 2018 the market isn’t close to factoring in the higher dividends for 2019 and the future dividend growth prospects. AMGP evolving into the new AM is one of my highest conviction total return prospects for the next three years. To keep the yield at the current 4%, AMGP at the end of 2018 must double in 2019.

112,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- EVIO EVIO,"I’m extremely bullish on cannabis, in case you couldn’t tell. This is the birth of an industry that is set to grow to epic proportions. We’re talking tens, maybe even hundreds, of billions of dollars a year, asserts Jason Williams (NYSE:WMB), editor of The Wealth Advisory.
And we’ve got the opportunity to invest in the future leaders of that industry on the ground floor. So, you shouldn’t be surprised that my speculative pick for 2019 is also a cannabis stock. But don’t go thinking this is just some company that grows or sells marijuana. It’s far more important to the industry than only being a producer.
This year, many U.S. states and the entire country of Canada passed laws that require the testing of legal cannabis before it can be sold to dispensaries. All the cannabis, all the oils, all the edibles — everything has to be tested for pesticides and other various chemicals before it can make it onto store shelves.
And few companies were ready for this move. Most producers already had things like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) levels tested so they could display it on their packages. And flowers were given visual inspections for bugs and mold. But nothing this stringent had been in place.
So, the industry was caught unprepared. And for a while, shelves were almost bare in some states as producers and the few labs that are out there rushed to get everything tested to meet the new standards.
But there was one company that saw the industry growing and knew regulations would soon get around to what was in the products being sold. So, its management set out to become the largest cannabis-testing company in the country. And it’s well on its way to accomplishing its goal.
EVIO (EVIO) is the largest publicly traded cannabis tester. And it’s battling for the top spot overall. It hasn’t seen the kind of interest that the Canadian companies have. It hasn’t even seen the kind of interest that most U.S. companies have. But that’s because the growers are the focus right now. Nobody is looking at the pick-and-shovel plays that keep the industry running. Not yet, at least.
But once investors start looking for parts of the industry that aren’t already saturated with cash, testing labs will be one of the first places they go. And EVIO is the best investment in that part of the cannabis market. Its balance sheet is a little beat-up right now because of the cost of such rapid expansion.
But management plans to use proceeds from its operational labs in the U.S. and Canada to pay down debt and expand further. This could be the year that cannabis becomes fully legal in the U.S. Established American companies will dominate the global market after that. So, getting invested now would set you up for massive profits down the road.

The company focuses on the production of lithium compounds for use in lithium batteries, notes analyst Bill Selesky with Argus Research, a leading independent Wall Street Research firm.
Fiscal 2017 revenue totaled $3.07 billion. The current environment is extremely positive, based on strong global demand for lithium-ion batteries used in consumer electronics and automobiles. Lithium demand continues to exceed expectations and is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.
 Lithium producers are seeking to acquire additional mines in anticipation of increasing demand. Pricing remains strong based on solid demand trends and weak capacity growth. On size and scale, ALB operates 31 facilities worldwide. Some 80% of projected 2021 demand has already been secured by customer contracts.
Albemarle’s long-term goal is to ramp up lithium production by expanding existing mines and pursuing joint ventures and acquisitions. This should lead to substantially higher-than-average profit growth.
Albemarle focuses on shareholder returns through both dividend increases and stock buybacks. The company raised its dividend by 5% in February 2018 and has increased its dividend for 24 straight years.

The company operates high-profile dating sites such as its namesake Match, Tinder, Plenty Of Fish, Meetic, Ok Cupid, Pairs, Twoo, and OurTime.
I don’t know about you, but in my age category (late-40s to early 50s) there’s a huge growing population of couples recently divorced. In fact, most of my friends are going on dates for the first time in years, and many of them have found dating partners via Match.com.
The result of MTCH’s operations have been EPS growth (both current and over the past several years) that’s in the top 3% of all publicly traded companies.
On the share price front, MTCH’s approximate 30% gain in 2018 put it in the top 10% of all publicly traded companies. And because stocks that show positive momentum on strong earnings tend to continue showing positive momentum, I think MTCH will continue riding higher in 2019.
Of course, MTCH was volatile in 2018. Yet that just makes it one of the many stocks that showed hyper-volatility during a most-volatile year. Moreover, MTCH’s surge off of the November lows shows a stock poised to continue trending higher in 2019.
And, consider this … after the crazy year that was 2018, what we all could use is a hot date (or at least a hot stock date). That’s why I will be logging on to Match Group shares in 2019. Disclosure: At the time of this writing, Jim Woods was long MTCH in his Bullseye Stock Trader advisory service.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Europe's Arianespace is discounting the price of satellite launches with its Ariane 5 rockets as it competes against U.S. rival SpaceX for customers before the release of the cheaper Ariane 6 rocket next year, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
Arianespace is aiming for the cost of launching the Ariane 6 to fall by around 40 percent versus the Ariane 5 through design changes and higher volume production, bringing its prices more in line with Elon Musk's SpaceX, Arianespace Managing Director and Head of Sales for Asia-Pacific Vivian Quenet said.
He said in current marketing campaigns, the company is offering customers such as telecoms an Ariane 5 launch for the same price as the Ariane 6.
""We have made a lot of effort on the sales price. When we do that, the result is very positive,"" Quenet told reporters on Wednesday, declining to discuss details of profitability.
Arianespace is competing for two major launch contracts in the Asia-Pacific region that should be awarded this year and expects there could be tenders for another three, he said.
Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), completed 11 launches with its Ariane 5, Vega and Soyuz rockets in 2018, in line with guidance that had been lowered mid-year from an initial 14.
The company, which has a mission of guaranteeing Europe independent access to space and is used by government and commercial clients, this month forecast up to 12 launches in 2019, with four of them targeted in the first quarter.
The Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates the satellite launch services market is worth $5.5 billion a year. SpaceX has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.
Another U.S. group, the United Launch Alliance joint venture between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), said last week it would conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months as it also looks to lower costs to better compete against SpaceX.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said this month it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan.
SpaceX, which media reports say is valued at $30.5 billion, said this month it would fire about 10 percent of its more than 6,000 employees, seeking to create a leaner company to deal with the ""extraordinarily difficult"" challenges of developing interplanetary spacecraft and a global space-based internet.
Arianespace's majority shareholder, ArianeGroup, announced on Tuesday it had signed a contract with the European Space Agency to study a mission to the moon before 2025 with the aim of mining regolith, an ore from which it is possible to extract water and oxygen.

Quenet said if the mission proceeded, it would be launched with the Ariane 6 at its facilities in French Guiana.

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 149 points, or 0.61%, to 24,538.5 points by 7:08 AM ET (12:08 GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 10 points, or 0.38%, to 2,642.12points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 31 points, or 0.46%, to 6,683.88 points.
Wall Street registered a sharp decline on Tuesday as concerns of a slowdown in global growth hit U.S. stocks on the back of the International Monetary Fund’s warning of escalating risks from the U.S.-Sino trade dispute and uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.
Wednesday’s bounce came as Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he planned to hold votes Thursday on two separate proposals to end the government shutdown. As the record-long political impasse entered its 33rd straight day, little hope was seen that either proposal would mark a breakthrough in the dispute over funding for the border wall with Mexico.
“Risk asset prices have been essentially supported just by easing of U.S. rate hike expectations,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economics strategy at HSBC Securities.
“Economic data has been weak and the U.S. government shutdown should be hurting economic sentiment, but even that has been considered as positive for risk assets, on the grounds that they make it difficult for the Fed to raise rates.”
Experts comment that the shutdown also complicates the data-dependent Fed’s ability to evaluate the U.S. economy with the Commerce Department not releasing essential data.
Meanwhile, sentiment received a boost from positive earnings reports from Dow components IBM (NYSE:IBM), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).
Ford (NYSE:F) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) are among companies reporting after the market close.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, slipped 0.04% to 95.93 by 6:54 AM ET (11:54 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury gained 2.9 basis points to 2.76%.

The company said on Wednesday that Edouard Carmignac would step back from his role as co-fund manager of the Carmignac Patrimoine fund and hand over full control of it to David Older, head of equities, and to fixed income head Rose Ouahba.
""Thirty years after the creation of Carmignac, I am pleased to entrust Rose and David with the management of Carmignac Patrimoine,"" he said in a statement.
He will remain a member of the strategic investment committee and will stay on as chief investment officer of Carmignac, which he founded in 1989.

The office closures will affect 1,270 staff, of whom Santander hopes to redeploy about a third.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - U.S. fast food chain Taco Bell plans to double its international footprint with Asian markets as the main driver for overseas growth as awareness about Mexican cuisine grows, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
The Mexican-inspired Yum! Brands (N:YUM) subsidiary, which has 7,000 restaurants in the United States, will bring its overseas store count to ""over 500 units this year ... (with) a goal of getting to a thousand units internationally in the next few years,"" Liz Williams (NYSE:WMB), President of Taco Bell International, told Reuters in an interview.
Taco Bell retreated from Singapore in 2009. It returned to Japan in 2015 after withdrawing in the 1980s.
""Consumers weren't ready in terms of awareness and the brand wasn't positioned right at the time,"" she said.
But thanks to a ""heightened awareness"" of Mexican food, broader palettes and brand exposure by millennials from more travel and technology, at least half of the new units will come from the Asia-Pacific region, she said.
Taco Bell, which sells tacos and burritos, was also adding new flavors and items for local markets citing that its signature sauce was modified for its new store in Thailand, which will open on Thursday.
""We've amped them up significantly,"" Williams said, because research showed the sauce was not hot enough for Thai palette.
Vinegar notes were also dialed down, which were said to be unpopular with locals, Williams said.
Taco Bell, with franchise partner  Thoresen Thai  Agencies Pcl (BK:TTA), plans 40 stores in Southeast Asia's second largest economy by 2022.

Last year it doubled store count in India to 32 and signed two franchise agreements for 110 new stores across Australia and New Zealand by 2024.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Blank-check company IPOs moving ahead despite government shutdown,"By Joshua Franklin and Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - A corner of the market for initial public offerings (IPO) is evading the freeze on stock market flotations inflicted by the U.S. government shutdown, putting the spotlight on listings that usually stay under most investors' radar.
""Blank-check"" companies, which launch IPOs to raise money for acquisitions, are taking advantage of their unique structure to proceed without the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been paralyzed by the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. 
With other stock market debuts on hold while the SEC remains largely closed, this is enabling these companies, also known as special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs), to have the IPO limelight all to themselves.
""Right now, SPACs are a way for investors to participate in the IPO market when there is no other market,"" said Gregg Noel, head of the West Coast capital markets practice of U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. 
Most firms rely on the SEC to greenlight their IPO following its review of their prospectus to investors. 
(Graphic: SPACs set to dominate U.S. IPOs during shutdown - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hj7dtP)
Under SEC rules, however, companies can make their IPO registration ""effective"" on their own if they agree to lock in their IPO price 20 days before their market debut. 
Because SPACs are essentially shell vehicles with no pre-existing assets, their initial valuation is based solely on the amount of cash they raise, which allows their IPO price to be set in advance without alienating investors.
What is more, a SPAC's prospectus can often follow a standard template, minimizing the risk of running afoul of the SEC without its feedback.
""If SPACs are the majority of IPOs and this is in the news, it could elevate their profile. SPACs could become less of a niche investment,"" said Eric Pestrue, senior investment analyst at investment firm RiverNorth Capital Management LLC. 
At least half a dozen SPACs have amended their filings to go public without the SEC's input, regulatory filings showed. Nine SPACs are on file publicly for an IPO, according to IPO-focused research firm Renaissance Capital.
Excluding SPACs, some 80 companies have publicly filed with the SEC for an IPO, according to Renaissance Capital. 
On the other hand, companies such as ride-hailing startups Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc have been unable to move forward while they wait for the SEC to resume business.
New Fortress Energy, an owner of LNG liquefaction and regasification facilities which is scheduled to price its IPO this week, will not go ahead with its plans if the shutdown continues, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
No company has completed an IPO on the U.S. stock market since the shutdown started on Dec. 22.
OLD RISKS REMAIN
SPAC IPOs have never got much traction with long-term investors because of the risks involved: investors do not know in advance which company a SPAC will buy, although some do outline in advance what sectors they want to be active in. Many of their investors have ended up being hedge funds speculating on the SPACs ability to complete their targeted acquisition.
""The primary reservation investors have about SPACs is that it's a new product and they don't fully understand it,"" said Chinh Chu, a former Blackstone Group (N:BX) dealmaker who has done two SPACs. 
Most SPACs have also not offered much of a reward. The average SPAC has returned an average of 8 percent between 2014 and 2018, compared to 28 percent for the broader IPO market, according to data provider Dealogic.
The attention on SPACs during the shutdown could boost this niche asset class, which makes up about 20 percent of the U.S. IPO market. 

""SPACs are having their day right now, for sure. Could the shutdown increase it? I think it is contingent on the government remaining shut and interesting deals coming,"" said Howard Fischer, CEO and founding managing partner of Basso Capital, a SPAC-focused hedge fund.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China's Union Life to sell majority stake, draw local, overseas bidders - sources","By Kane Wu and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Union Life Insurance is planning to sell a controlling stake that could be snapped up by locals or foreigners looking to tap into the country's growing demand for insurance products, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A majority sale to an offshore company would mark a rare purchase of a financial services firm in China by a foreigner, indicating Beijing's push to ease ownership rules and attract investors to the world's No.3 insurance market were paying off.
Union Life, expected to be valued at $1.5 billion to $2 billion, plans to sell as much as 51 percent, with an option to raise that to 100 percent later, the people said, declining to be named as the details are not public yet.
AIA (HK:1299), the world's second-largest life insurer by market value, and the Asian unit of  Prudential  (L:PRU) are among the foreign players likely to submit initial bids due over the next few weeks, the people added.
News of the sale comes as China is in the process of easing foreign ownership curbs for life insurance joint ventures to 51 percent from 50 percent. Beijing also pledged in 2017 to remove the limit completely in three years as it pushes to open up its financial sector worth trillions of dollars.
A deal with a foreign player would help dispel concerns about China's commitment to liberalize while it remains in the grips of a crippling trade war with the United States.
The shortlist of buyers interested in Union Life after the first-round bids is likely to be completed by the end of this quarter, one of the people said.
Spokespeople at Union Life could not be reached by Reuters even after several calls to its headquarters at Beijing.
AIA and Prudential representatives declined to comment.
NEXT BATTLEGROUND FOR INSURERS
Investment bankers see the opening up of China's financial sector, from asset management to insurance businesses, providing attractive acquisition opportunities for overseas firms.
With a low market penetration at 3 percent of gross domestic product, a growing middle class and increasing awareness, the easing up of ownership curbs is set to make China the next battleground for global insurers.
Chinese life insurance premiums grew 21 percent in 2017, above its 10-year average of 14 percent and compared to a fall of 2.7 percent in advanced markets, including the United States, according to Swiss Re data.
To capitalize on stellar growth prospects and draw in more funds from overseas, Beijing will accept applications from early 2019 from foreign insurers seeking to take control of their local joint ventures and is weighing giving them full ownership sooner than flagged, sources have told Reuters. [nL4N1XP2ZM]
As of now, Hong Kong-based AIA is the only wholly-owned foreign life insurance firm in China as its operations were set up before the ownership restrictions were introduced.
Prudential has a 50:50 joint venture with China's CITIC Ltd.
(Graphic: Contribution to life premium growth by market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hnxh7c)
INTEREST IN UNION LIFE
Foreign insurers are expected to be drawn to Union Life due to its customer base and product distribution network, which has been a challenge for overseas players given limited physical presence in the country, the people said.
""The limited distribution network will continue to be a challenge for foreign insurance companies even after raising holding in the joint ventures,"" said one of the people.
""So access to an established distribution network will be a major attraction,"" the person added.
If Union Life's talks with a foreign bidder reach an advanced stage, the prospective buyer would have to seek regulatory approval, another person said. It is not clear how Union Life's business would be merged with existing operations.
Founded in 2005 in central China's Hubei province, Union Life is a national insurer with more than 80 billion yuan ($11.8 billion) in assets, offering life, property and medical insurance products, its website shows.
A company controlled by Union Life's founder is its majority shareholder, with a 46 percent stake.
Its life insurance business raked in 14.5 billion yuan in premium over January-November 2018, versus 22.8 billion yuan a year ago, sector regulator data shows.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","China's Evergrande sells $3 billion in bonds, yields top 10 percent","By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), one of China's most indebted property developers, sold $3 billion in dollar bonds on Wednesday in Asia's biggest offshore high-yield bond sale so far this year.
Evergrande is China's second-largest property developer by sales and has been under pressure to raise funds to cut its large debt pile, which stood at 671.1 billion yuan ($98.88 billion) as of June 2018, according to CreditSights.
The sale was a reopening of $2.1 billion in existing bonds.
The company sold an additional $1.1 billion in bonds maturing in 2020, $875 million in bonds maturing in 2021 and $1.025 billion in notes due in 2022, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters.
The yields on the new bonds were a lot higher as the bonds were sold below par. The 2020 bonds had a yield of 8.25 percent, an increase of 125 basis points (bps), the 2021 bonds had a yield of 9.5 percent, an increase of 325 bps, and the 2022 bonds had a yield of 10.5 percent, an increase of 225 bps, the term sheet showed.
China's property developers have been very active in the bond markets in the past few weeks, seeking to take advantage of better market conditions just as they face almost $100 billion in maturing debt both onshore and offshore this year.
Based on Refinitiv data, the Evergrande sale would bring the total raised in dollar bonds by property developers to $7.2 billion so far this year, compared to the $18.8 billion in offshore bonds they sold last year.
Investors shied away from junk-rated debt last year as a steep sell-off in markets made deals hard to complete and forced some companies to offer to pay double-digit yields for two-year paper.
Evergrande itself repriced the market in late October when it sold $1.8 billion of bonds with coupons as high as 13.75 percent.
The order book for the latest sale reached $4 billion at its peak, according to a banker on the deal.
But investors now see value in China's junk bonds given the higher yields.
""We are upbeat about low-rated, high-yield and short-term duration bonds which benefit from looser liquidity and when private enterprises’ financing difficulties are eased,"" said Freddy Wong, fixed income chief investment officer in China and portfolio manager at Fidelity International.
S&P said the reopening of Evergrande's bonds ""will slightly improve Evergrande's liquidity, which we still assess to be less than adequate, with liquidity sources marginally covering uses over the next 12 months.""
CEB International, China CITIC Bank International,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS were joint global coordinators for Evergrande's bond sale.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>","Volvo recalls over 200,000 cars to fix fuel leak issue","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], is voluntarily recalling about 200,000 cars after it found an engineering issue that could potentially cause fuel leakage in the engine compartment over time.
The group said its probe had identified that some vehicles may have small cracks inside one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment, which along with a pressurized fuel system may over time lead to fuel leakage in the engine compartment.
About 219,000 cars of 11 different models produced in 2015 and 2016 had been affected, the Swedish company said, with the highest number of impacted cars in Sweden, the UK and Germany. The Swedish recall was first reported by daily Aftonbladet.
Volvo sold 503,127 cars in 2015 and 534,332 cars in 2016.
""There are no reports alleging injuries or damages related to this issue. Volvo preventatively recalls the cars to avert any possible future problems,"" Volvo said in its statement. 
The company's fortunes have been revived since Geely bought it in 2010 and its popular new premium models now compete with larger rivals  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). It sold a record 642,253 cars in 2018.
However, a prolonged U.S.-China trade war has inflated raw materials costs and resulted in a slowdown in Chinese demand for cars. That has forced Volvo to spend to retool its global factories to limit the negative tariff impact and led it to postpone its plans to go public indefinitely.
This month, Geely Automobile (HK:0175), the main listed unit of the Geely empire which owns Volvo, forecast flat sales this year, as China's most successful carmaker struggles with slowing economic growth and more cautious consumers.
A Volvo spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday on the cost of the latest recall.
The company made its largest recall ever in 2004, when it called back 460,000 cars to fix wiring in an electronic control module for the cars' main cooling fan.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>","Don't break your Hong Kong piggy bank, CLSA cautions investors","By Noah Sin
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors should focus on ""limiting losses rather than chasing large gains"" in the Year of the Pig, which will be a roller-coaster year for Hong Kong's stock market, according to brokerage CLSA.
The Year of the Pig, which symbolizes hard work and affection, will be upset by ""small quarrels and pesky spirits"", CSLA said on Wednesday in its annual Feng Shui Index, a tongue-in-cheek financial forecast.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) will dip in the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 5, before ""yin metal"" and ""yang fire"" heat up sentiments in May and June, it said.
The market will sour in July and September, CLSA said, but investors should hold out for ""a fat end to a lean year"" as stocks rocket in November, before tumbling again in December.
The market predictions are built on the five elements in Chinese astrology - wood, metal, earth, fire and water. The new year is the year of the Earth Pig.
Earth industries, such as construction and real estate, are expected to rise through late summer, CLSA said, while tourism, logistics, hospitality and shipping will rise in the second half.
Those investing in Hong Kong's housing market should avoid buying in the southwest and northwest of the former British colony and focus on the center, where the Eight White wealth star sits, the brokerage said.
In the stock market, the index is bullish on technology and internet names as the element of fire courses through the Feng Shui chart. Telecoms and utilities will also benefit, CLSA said. Restraint is preferred over metal-related sectors, such as financials and machinery.
The Hang Seng Index has climbed roughly 4.5 percent so far this year. It shed 13.6 percent of its value in 2018, as the U.S.-China trade war and cooling Chinese demand hurt sentiment.
Beyond markets, the Feng Shui Index tipped Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader's sister, to progress in her career, Australian Labor Party leader Bill Shorten to take over the premiership and ""Crazy Rich Asians"" star Michelle Yeoh to do well.

CSLA started the Feng Shui Index in 1992, the Year of the Monkey, as a Lunar New Year card for clients.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>",U.S. airlines tap army helicopter pilots to ease shortage,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Army pilot Shaun Perez spent ten hours flying an Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopter over Afghanistan, providing gun cover for Special Forces soldiers on the ground as they hunted for high-value targets, guns and weapons.
Returning to his base at dawn, he donned a fresh uniform before shutting himself into a small room to secure the next stage of his career - as a commercial airline pilot.
He would win the job in a video interview that day in August 2017, joining hundreds of other U.S. military helicopter pilots who have taken attractive offers from domestic airlines trying ease a global pilot shortage.
Perez took advantage of one of the tightest labor markets in the United States, created by years of slow hiring, a wave of pending retirements at major U.S. airlines, and Federal Aviation Administration rules that in 2013 increased the number of required training hours from 250 to 1,500. 
The industry's aggressive recruitment of military helicopter pilots is one of the most striking examples yet of the contortions required to quickly train new commercial aviators since the FAA increased the minimum flying requirement. The pilot shortage threatens the industry's growth just as travel demand booms.
Airlines have been forced to more than double starting salaries to $54,000, excluding bonuses, in 2018 from $21,000 a decade ago, according to aviation consultant Kit Darby. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RPIG3S) 
Perez, 38, now flies under the banner of United Express, the regional branch of United Airlines, at a strong starting salary with his training costs covered.
Ten U.S. regional carriers are offering helicopter pilots like Perez up to $50,000 to pay for commercial airplane training, and in some cases additional signing bonuses, according to a survey by Reuters.
""This is the first time that the industry is committing direct funds, basically a subsidy, to get that training quickly,"" said Bryan Simmons, president of Coast Flight Training, which pioneered the so-called rotor transition program for helicopter pilots with American Airlines Group Inc's regional subsidiary, Envoy, in San Diego.
Perez was offered $38,000 by Trans State Airlines for training that cost him $20,000. He got to keep the difference, and within months of leaving Afghanistan, was flying a 50-seater regional passenger jet.
He said he is taking home about $3,200 a month with the prospect of earning far more once he moves up to a large U.S. carrier. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NVcZoB )
""Even if you had to pay $100,000 for training, you're going into a field where you know you're going to make that money back and more,"" Perez said.
Regional airlines' helicopter transition programs offer flow-through agreements with mainline carriers, providing new pilots an interview - and in some cases, a job - with a major within a few years. 
To fly a multi-engine passenger jet - which can travel about five times faster than helicopters and has more complex control panels - helicopter veterans need to complete fixed-wing FAA ratings and required flight time.
The transition feels natural to Perez. 
""We took multiple ground fire; we had hard missions,"" he said. ""But once we step into that (airline) cockpit, we're humble and we work hard.""
CLEVER WORKAROUND
A key reason airlines are chasing military pilots is because the new FAA training rules only require them to have 750 hours of additional training, half the 1,500 required of civilians seeking a commercial pilot license.
Military helicopter pilots from the military only need additional training in flying fixed-wing aircraft, which takes about 90 days. For civilians, obtaining a commercial pilot license can take years and cost more than $100,000.
""We've stumbled upon the quickest solution to the pilot shortage,"" said Erik Sabiston, an Army veteran turned commercial pilot who founded Rotary to Airline Group in Dec. 2017 to help helicopter, or rotor, pilots make the transition to passenger jets. The not-for-profit group, with more than 7,000 pilots and mechanics, also assists airlines in designing rotor transition programs. 
American Airlines' regional carrier Envoy said more than a quarter of its 701 new pilots in 2018 came from military helicopters, compared with 11 percent in 2017 and 5 percent in 2016. It plans to hire 626 pilots in 2019, with about a quarter of those expected to come through its rotor program.
""It's an untapped pool of pilots that hadn't been brought to anyone's attention before,"" Envoy pilot recruiter Megan Liotta said. 
Former military helicopter pilots generally adapt quickly to the differences in a jet's speed and controls and have a higher success rate in landing jobs than other aspiring aviators, recruiters said. 
""They come from an environment that has trained them to think on their feet and be very adaptable,"" said David Tatum, director of pilot recruitment for American.
For former military pilots, the surge in interest from airlines helps replace the shrinking number of jobs flying helicopters to offshore oil rigs. 
A Envoy pilot hired today makes about $60,000 or more in their first year as a first officer. They can expect to upgrade to captain, at a higher pay scale, within two years before moving on to No. 1 U.S. carrier American within six years, the company said. Top-end salaries at American surpass $300,000.
RISING SALARIES, COSTS
As regional airlines pay more to attract and retain pilots, their services are becoming more expensive for major national airlines that have increasingly used the regionals for domestic routes to cut costs.
Under those contracts, called capacity purchase agreements, labor costs are factored into the prices that the mainline carriers pay the regionals for their service. 
""Their cost saving method is losing a bit of steam,"" said Andrew Watterson, chief revenue officer for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, which does not partner with regional carriers. 
Aviation consultant Samuel Engel said a 50 percent increase in pilot costs at the regional carriers would amount to a 7.7 percent increase in overall costs per seat-mile on a 70-seater, erasing some of the cost advantage of regional aircraft on a per-seat-mile basis.
So far, airlines have succeeded in passing on rising costs to passengers, often through extra charges for luggage or preferred seating. But analysts have questioned their ability to continue raising fees.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co estimates a need for 790,000 new pilots in the commercial aviation, business aviation, and civil helicopter industries over the next two decades.

""The problem is,"" Darby said, ""we're still not creating enough pilots ... to meet the need.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will add the Trans-Amazonian Highway to the list of projects for privatization, its infrastructure minister said on Tuesday, seeking new investment to pave part of a dictatorship-era roadway already blamed for extensive deforestation.
The road concession will be added to a priority list for privatization at a meeting next month, Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio Freitas told Reuters in an interview.
The government will package a short section of highway with a concession to run a major section of BR-163, a key northern route for shipping Brazilian grains, a ministry spokesman said later on Tuesday. The 40-km (25-mile) section of the Trans-Amazonian up for privatization will connect BR-163 with the river port of Miritituba in northern state of Para, the spokesman said.
President Jair Bolsonaro's government is seeking to overhaul Brazil's poor transportation infrastructure, which raises costs and causes delays for the commodity-exporting powerhouse, by seeking private investors to operate dozens of road, rail and airport projects.
On Monday, government Secretary Adalberto Vasconcelos, who has been tasked with creating public-private infrastructure partnerships, said the country would privatize more airports and secure new investment for railways.
For roadways, five concessions are slated for auction this year with a long pipeline of projects to follow, according to Freitas. BR-262/381 in the state of Minas Gerais, sometimes called the ""Road of Death"" because its poor condition has contributed to lethal accidents, will also be put on the privatization list next month, he said.
The Trans-Amazonian highway, officially known as BR-230, was inaugurated in the 1970s under Brazil's military dictatorship, but only a fraction of its nearly 3,000 kilometers (1,864-miles) were paved and much of the existing roadway has fallen into disrepair. It stretches from the coastal state of Paraiba deep into Amazonas state. Original plans for it to reach the border with Peru were never completed.
Nevertheless, research by Brazil's space agency and academics has linked the road to a rise in deforestation, and road improvements allowing easier access deep into the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have consistently led to increased deforestation nearby.
He said that major construction firms that were implicated in corruption schemes remain unable to participate in public auctions for infrastructure projects, but could act as subcontractors for winners of concession auctions.
Engineering conglomerates implicated in corruption schemes to fix contracts include Odebrecht SA and Andrade Gutierrez SA, with those companies signing leniency deals with the government admitting guilt and agreeing to cooperate.

""They are companies that have know-how, companies with engineering (ability), companies that can provide good services,"" Freitas said.

China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%, while the Shenzhen Component was little changed at 7,514.97 by 9:13 PM ET (02:13 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 0.1% higher.
Citing a source familiar with the situation, CNBC reported that Washington called off the meeting due to “outstanding disagreements between the two sides over the enforcement of intellectual property rules.”
U.S. trade officials were scheduled to meet with two Chinese vice ministers this week, the report said.
However, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow later denied that an official meeting had been cancelled and said that “there was never a planning meeting” other than the visit by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He next week.
The White House told CNBC that ""the teams remain in touch in preparation for high-level talks with Vice Premier Liu He at the end of this month.""
Separately, while not a directional driver for Asian equities, China’s Finance Ministry officials said on Wednesday that Beijing would step up fiscal spending this year to support its economy.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.1%, even after data showed the country’s exports and imports fell short of market expectations, with exports posting the biggest fall in more than two years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc will pay $269.2 million to settle two whistleblower lawsuits accusing it of civil fraud for overbilling federal healthcare programs over a decade, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.
The pharmacy chain will pay $209.2 million to resolve claims it improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs from 2006 to 2017 for hundreds of thousands of insulin pens it dispensed to patients it knew did not need them.
Walgreens will also pay $60 million to resolve claims it overcharged Medicaid from 2008 to 2017 by failing to disclose and charge the discount drug prices it offered the public through its Prescription Savings Club program.
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company said it ""admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility"" for conduct alleged by the federal government, according to the settlement agreements.
In a separate statement, Walgreens said it ""has admitted no wrongdoing,"" and that the settlements were in the best interests of customers, patients and other stakeholders.
It also said it set aside enough money for both settlements as of Nov. 30, 2018.
The company recently had more than 9,400 drugstores in the United States.
Walgreens' settlements resolve claims under the federal False Claims Act, which lets private whistleblowers sue on the federal government's behalf and share in recoveries.
The accords were respectively approved last week by U.S. District Judges Paul Crotty and Paul Oetken, who both sit in Manhattan.
About $200 million of the payout will go to the federal government, and the rest to state governments. 
Walgreens also entered a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure future compliance with federal healthcare programs.
Two pharmacists filed the original complaint concerning the insulin pens in July 2015. A copy of that complaint could not immediately be obtained on Tuesday.
Marc Baker, who worked for Walgreens for a decade as a pharmacy manager in Florida, filed the original complaint concerning the drug price discounts in January 2012.
Both lawsuits had been filed under seal.

The cases are U.S. ex rel Rahimi v Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 15-05686; and U.S. ex rel Baker v Walgreens Inc in the same court, No. 12-00300.

 The U.S. stock markets were closed yesterday in remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King, and given the headwinds the world economy faces, perhaps policymakers could benefit from his overriding message of inclusion and cooperation.
Many of the biggest risks facing the global economy stem from a failure to “get along,” both internationally (the ongoing US-China trade war) and domestically (the U.S. government shutdown & Brexit). The last 24 hours highlighted these differences on numerous fronts: The U.S. extradition request for a prominent Chinese businesswoman, the IMF’s decision to downgrade its global growth forecasts (due partially to trade tensions), the lukewarm reception to PM May’s Brexit Plan B bill, and the increasingly-contentious U.S. government shutdown.
As a result, traders are aggressively selling U.S. equities, with major indices unwinding the gains from Friday’s trade-optimism-induced rally. From a technical perspective, the S&P 500 has now broken down from its rising wedge pattern off the Boxing Day panic low (see chart below). Despite the seemingly bullish name, this price action pattern shows that buyers are struggling to push the price higher on each subsequent swing. It is a classic sign of waning buying pressure and often portends a bearish reversal. That said, we’re hesitant to make any broad conclusions off merely a single down day, especially following such a strong rally off the lows.
Source: TradingView, FOREX.com
Moving forward, bulls will want to see if prices can hold above the key previous support level in the 2600 range. A break below there could open the door for a retest of the late December lows. Meanwhile, the key area to watch, if prices rally, will be the confluence of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the Q4 swoon and the 100-day moving average near 2715.
Shutdown tensions are poised to pick up with 800,000 government employees set to miss their second paycheck on Friday, and three of the four largest publicly-traded companies on the planet set to report Q4 earnings next week—Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday — volatility may be here to stay."
158,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:09PM ET</span>",Trading in the Dark- 24 Economic Reports Delayed & One that Came in Strong,"The government shutdown is now the longest in history and it is delaying economic reports traders rely on as fundamental gauges on the economy, says Don Kaufman.
On Friday, New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) stated the shutdown could cut economic growth by 1%. That would cut growth by about half.
The table below shows the list of economic reports that haven’t come out because of the government shutdown. This is in addition to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders (COT) Report and numerous U.S. Department of Agriculture reports. The Q4 GDP estimates could be off by more than usual because the economic reports from November and December have been delayed. We will find out if they are correct in the next few weeks once the government shutdown is over. It’s possible that most Q4 GDP estimates are so close because the data from November and December hasn’t been released yet. I was mistaken to express as much confidence in the Q4 GDP estimates as I did in a previous article. These delays explain why I am so confused by the rally in stocks. How can you buy stocks when they are up so much in the past couple weeks and you don’t know how the economy is doing?
Great industrial production report
In the midst of this economic wilderness, we received a great December Industrial Production report.
As you can see from the chart below, the hard industrial production manufacturing report showed improvement while the soft ISM manufacturing report showed slowing growth. Hard data is much more important than soft data, so this is great news.
Specifically, industrial production was up 0.3% month-over-month and 4% year-over-year. This met expectations on a monthly basis. However, the monthly comp got easier because growth was revised from 0.6% to 0.4% in November.
This report seems to have verified the stock market rally this year. Obviously, it’s only one report, but it is important enough to nullify all the weak soft data manufacturing surveys from December.
Manufacturing was up an amazing 1.1% month-over-month, which was the fastest growth since February 2018. That’s better than the consensus of 0.1% and last month’s 0.1% growth. Year-over-year growth was 3.2%. Finally, capacity to utilization increased from 78.6% to 78.7%.
Because of this great report, it is now inching closer to the cycle high, which was 79.6%.
When you dig into the details, this report was even better than it seems. Headline growth was strong even though utility production was down 6.3% because of warm weather. Mining production was up 1.5%. This positive report was driven by vehicle production, construction supplies and business equipment which were up 4.7%, 1.6%, and 0.5% respectively. Consumer goods were weak as monthly growth was flat and yearly growth was only 1%.
On a year-over-year basis, vehicle production, business equipment, construction supplies, mining and utilities growth were 7.8%, 5%, 2.1%, 13.4%, and -4.3% respectively. "

The bank examined output growth, costs, capital expenditure, profitability, free cash flow, valuation and the outlook for commodities. Its conclusion: Oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA is the most appealing option for stock pickers.
While Vale SA, the world’s biggest producer of iron ore, benefits from higher profitability and an attractive valuation, Petrobras has a more attractive structural case, JPMorgan analysts Rodolfo Angele and Ricardo Rezende wrote in a report Jan. 22.
The analysts noted Petrobras’s shift toward loosening its operational ties to the state over the past three years amid new Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco’s move to oust the last top executives nominated during the Workers’ Party governments. Moreover, Castello Branco has vowed to increase oil production, reduce debt and proceed with the firm’s divestment program.
JPMorgan also sees potential gains coming from asset sales and a bill in Brazil’s Congress that would allow Petrobras to sell offshore crude reserves to other drillers. The bank predicts output will pick up this year, boosting free cash flow and helping the company deleverage.
JPMorgan has buy recommendations for American depositary receipts from both Vale and Petrobras, and likes Petrobras preferred shares over the common stock.

The owner of MTV Networks and Nickelodeon sees the purchase of the six-year-old company as another way to build a so-called direct-to-consumer business, Viacom said, while avoiding the capital intensive task of competing directly against subscription video services owned or to be built by Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and AT&T Inc's (N:T) WarnerMedia.
Viacom's moves reflect a rekindled interest in advertising supported digital media kicked off by  Roku , a device maker that helped viewers stream online videos on TVs that was spun off from Netflix. Amazon has also launched a free TV service recently. 
Pluto TV claims 12 million monthly active users and licenses programming from 130 film and TV partners, including Viacom. 
It is available on devices made by Roku Inc (O:ROKU) , Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Sony Corp (T:6758) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL). The app is also available on smart televisions from Samsung (KS:005930) and Vizio.
Viacom said it sees Pluto TV as an important outlet for it to sell advanced advertising that has the ability to target viewers based on their habits. 

While Viacom has no plans to make current shows on pay TV services available for free on the service, it sees Pluto TV as a way to make money off its archives.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) is planning a new fund for investors looking to park their cash safely while helping the environment, expanding options for ""socially responsible"" investments, a filing with U.S. market regulators showed on Tuesday.
The world's largest fund manager told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it wants to launch a money-market fund that will invest primarily in debt from issuers who have better-than-average environmental practices.
BlackRock, which oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, also planned to commit 5 percent of the net revenue from its management fee on the BlackRock Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund, or LEAF, to purchase carbon offsets. Money from carbon offsets generally funds projects that reduce emissions, such as planting trees or trapping methane emissions from waste dumps in developing countries.
Money-market funds invest in relatively safe short-term government or high-quality corporate-issued debt. Companies and investors treat the funds like cash and expect them to hold their value, earn income and be available at a moment's notice. It is rare for environmental factors to be taken into account as part of the investment strategy. In a statement, BlackRock said it would also make an annual payment to help the World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has been under increasing pressure by activist groups to address the perceived social and environmental shortcomings of companies held by his funds. 
Because the company's most popular products are index funds that hold broad swaths of the market, BlackRock has a significant stake in publicly traded companies worldwide that draw ire from investors, including alcohol, tobacco and weapons manufacturers as well as fossil-fuel companies. BlackRock also has a pivotal shareholder vote in corporate-governance matters involving those companies.
Last week, a hoax letter purporting to be from Fink claimed the fund manager would require companies it owns to align their businesses with measures to counter climate change. An advocacy group took credit for the fake letter.
BlackRock has not asked companies to meet specific environmental standards, saying its role is not to make political judgments on its clients' behalf.
But it has pressed oil-and-gas companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) to provide more information about how environmental regulations and related issues could affect their bottom lines. The asset manager has also unveiled new products for people focused on environmental goals.

In 2017, the company hired Brian Deese, a former Obama administration official who helped negotiate the Paris agreement on climate change, to run its sustainable investing group.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Ashland Global Holdings and Cruiser Capital settled their proxy contest on Tuesday with a deal allowing the hedge fund to help select two new board members at the specialty chemicals company while one of its board nominees becomes a consultant there.
""Ashland will consult with Cruiser Capital, in addition to its other shareholders, on the previously announced search for two new independent directors to be appointed to the Ashland board,"" the company said in a release.
Ashland Global also said that it will appoint Dr. William Joyce, retired former chairman and chief executive officer of Nalco, Hercules Inc and Union Carbide Corp, and vice chairman of  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW), as a consultant to the company on operations-related matters.
""We are pleased to have reached this agreement so we can return our full attention to executing on our ongoing transformation and achieving our financial and operational objectives,"" Ashland Chairman and CEO William A. Wulfsohn said in a statement. 
The settlement gives the hedge fund, which had pushed to replace four directors, input into the makeup of the board as well as on company operations.
Less than a week ago Ashland struck a deal to refresh its board with another large shareholder, Neuberger Berman, which owns 2.8 percent of the company, a move the hedge fund said hurts all investors.
Cruiser Capital owns 2.5 percent of Ashland and has been pushing its management for months to improve margins, saying it believes the company could be worth more than $125 a share if improvements are made. 
The stock closed trading on Tuesday at $77.19 and has climbed 5.4 percent in the last five sessions.

Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is forecast to report a profit of $1.21 per share in sales of about $17 billion.
As a defensive consumer staples stock, shares of P&G have bucked the trend and are up over the last 12 months, enjoying strong gains since its last earnings report in October, which showed solid organic sales growth.
United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) also reports results. On average, analysts expect that it earned $1.55 a share on revenue of nearly $17 billion.
And cable heavyweight Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is on the calendar as well.
Analysts forecast that Comcast had a profit of 65 cents per share in the latest quarter, with revenue of about $27.5 billion.
NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, announced earlier this month that it will be launching a digital streaming service.

""Of course, looking at Chinese oil demand one would not see any real evidence of a slowdown,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at The Price Futures Group brokerage in Chicago.
""OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has also vowed to do whatever it takes to support prices. Yet the question is can they do enough if the global economy slows more swiftly or gets hit with black swans or grey rhinos?”
Tomorrow there will be more numbers on the flip side of those concerns: U.S. supply.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>","IBM revenue beats estimates on strength in cloud, services businesses","(Reuters) -  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp reported a smaller-than-expected 3.5 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as higher sales in its newer businesses such as cloud, software and services partially offset tapering sales of its latest mainframe computers and the pressures from a strong dollar.
However, the company, which is wrapping up its $34 billion cloud deal for Linux software maker Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT), guided 2019 free cash flow below analysts' expectation, adding to investor concerns following the deal, the company's biggest.
IBM said revenue slipped to $21.76 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, but came in above analysts' average estimate of $21.71 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company reported net income of $1.95 billion, or $2.15 per share, compared with a loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.
IBM recorded a charge of $1.9 billion related to the U.S. tax overhaul in the latest reported quarter. The company took a $5.5 billion charge related to the tax reform in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding special items, the company earned $4.87 per share. Analysts had expected $4.82. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.
IBM also forecast operating earnings for 2019 to be ""at least"" $13.90 per share, while analysts on average were expecting $13.79.
The company said it expects free cash flow of about $12 billion for the year, roughly in line with 2018. Analysts on average are expecting $12.67 billion for 2019.
Under Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rommetty, IBM has been refocusing toward faster-growing cloud and analytics services to lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products and reverse years of revenue declines
Underscoring that push, IBM in October agreed to buy Red Hat, a deal expected to close in the second half of the year.
The company is also shedding some of its legacy business as part of the shift. The company said in December it would sell some of its software products business to India's HCL Technologies for $1.80 billion.
IBM said its cloud business, part of what it refers to as ""strategic imperatives"", grew 12 percent to $19.2 billion in 2018.
The company's cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services and is its second biggest, reported sales of $5.46 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of $5.25 billion.
IBM's revenue of $4.32 billion from its global businesses services segment also beat estimates of $4.15 billion.

The Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which makes over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, had warned in the third quarter that a strong dollar would hit its revenue.

The U.S. called off this week's talks with China on trade due to outstanding differences on two issues concerning intellectual property rights and Chinese subsidies that discriminate against foreign investors, The Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the negotiations.
Kudlow refuted the report on television, restoring investor hopes somewhat that both sides would be able to resolve their differences on trade ahead of the March 1 deadline, after which, in the absence of an agreement, the U.S. could raise duties on imports from China to 25% from 10%. Kudlow also confirmed that a meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He later this month would go ahead.
Washington and Beijing have introduced multiple rounds of tariffs on the imports of one another’s goods in recent months.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) Brazil unit is in advanced talks with Sao Paulo state to receive tax incentives, the company told public officials and union representatives at a meeting on Tuesday, a few days after telling workers in a memo that it was losing money in the country. 
GM's top executives in South America attended the meeting along with union representatives and mayors of the two cities where the automaker's Sao Paolo state plants are based. Two officials representing the two cities told Reuters GM disclosed the tax incentive discussions at the meeting. 
""They told us that the conversation with the state is very advanced, very positive,"" said Alberto Marques Filho, secretary of innovation for the city of São Jose dos Campos, where one GM plant is based and where the meeting took place.
GM declined to comment. A representative for the state government said in a statement it has ""been working to show the public that it is advantageous to keep the company in Sao Paulo.""
GM is the undisputed market leader for small cars and trucks in Latin America's largest economy, but it was not revealed until recently that the automaker was losing money there. 
Earlier this month, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the company had lowered its break-even point in the region in recent years by 40 percent, but it still faced ""unacceptable losses that need to be addressed.""
""We've begun work with key local stakeholders, dealers, suppliers, unions and government officials to take all necessary actions to generate acceptable returns in the near term or to consider other options,"" she added at an investor presentation on Jan. 11.
GM posted a memo in its plants in Brazil warning workers that it had experienced deep losses in the past two years and could not keep operating that way. GM has yet to comment on the memo, which was seen by Reuters.
GM, which is undergoing a global restructuring, also has announced thousands of layoffs in the United States and plans to shut two plants outside the United States which it has not yet identified. 
The automaker is also looking to negotiate future investments with its unions, the governments of cities where it operates, and suppliers, said José Auricchio, the mayor of another GM plant location, Sao Caetano do Sul. 
Auricchio and Marques Filho said GM had told them at the meeting that the governor of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, had personally participated in five meetings with the automaker to discuss tax incentives. 
The memo added that any turnaround plan for GM would require ""sacrifices from everyone."" 
Last year, Brazil's federal government granted carmakers with local plants a 15-year package of tax breaks, extending subsidies for an industry that has struggled to compete.

Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who took office with a new government this month, has said Brazil cannot afford to keep subsidizing powerful industries, arguing that an end to protectionist policies will make the economy more competitive.

(Reuters) - Hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value have taken stakes in eBay Inc (O:EBAY) and are pushing for changes including the sale of some of the e-commerce company's businesses.
In a letter to the company's board, Elliott asked eBay to hive off its StubHub ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan the hedge fund says could double the company's value.
Starboard has also taken a significant stake in eBay and been pushing for changes including asset sales in the past few months, a source familiar with the matter said separately. Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.
Shares of eBay rose as much as 12 percent before trading up 5.7 percent at $32.78 early Tuesday afternoon. They had lost a quarter of their value last year.
Elliott, which owns a more than 4 percent stake in eBay, said the company's share price could reach $55-$63 by 2020 if it implemented the hedge fund's restructuring plan.
""While we believe that execution missteps and unclear focus have impaired value, eBay is far from broken, and its future should be bright,"" Elliott's Jesse Cohn wrote, adding that his mother had built a successful business on eBay by selling jewelry for more than a decade.
EBay said it would review the proposal and is looking forward to engaging with Elliott.
""The eBay Board and leadership team regularly engage with our shareholders and value their input,"" the company said. 
The online seller has been a target for activist investors before. Carl Icahn urged eBay to spin off payments unit PayPal in 2014, a move the company followed through on in 2015. 
Elliott said StubHub on its own could be worth $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion and eBay Classifieds, which has an international footprint, could be sold or spun off and worth between $8 billion and $12 billion.
Elliott also asked for an initial meeting with the board to discuss its concerns and for the board to form an operations committee to execute on an improvement plan.
DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said he agreed that restructuring could create more value for shareholders.
The company ""has been primed to see activist intervention for some time now,"" Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.

More broadly, the Dow Industrials fell about 1.6%, nearly 400 points, in afternoon trading as weak earnings and global growth concerns weighed.
Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) fell 14% after soft guidance offset above-consensus fourth-quarter earnings of $2.11 a share on $3.63 billion in revenue. Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.10 a share on $3.62 billion in revenue.
For 2019, the company said it expected adjusted earnings in the range of $8.45 to $8.65 a share, below estimates of $8.79.
The soft guidance comes as fourth-quarter margins were hurt by external headwinds, including commodity inflation, foreign exchange and tariffs, though analysts said they expected an improvement in the second quarter.
""We anticipate margin improvement to begin in Q2 as year-over-year comparisons improve and headwinds lessen,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider. ""In 2019, we forecast 130 bps expansion to 36.5%.""

185,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>","It's the Fed's Balance Sheet, Stupid","The key to get an indication of the Fed’s true monetary policy stance is to keep your eye on the Fed balance sheet, writes Landon Whaley. He's presenting at MoneyShow Orlando Feb. 9.
Investors are paying attention to the wrong aspect of Federal Reserve policy. I’ve seen enough Fed soundbites from both hawks and doves over the last few weeks to last me a lifetime. However, as is usually the case, people are focused on the wrong aspect of monetary policy, and their pre-occupation with rate hikes (and cuts) is going to get them the same woodshed treatment they experienced in Q4 2018.
Pre-crisis, the most important aspect of central bank policy was probably the action a central bank took with short term rates. But it’s 2019, and after a decade of unprecedented easing by central banks globally, the most important aspect of monetary policy is the balance sheet and how central banks manage it.
Back in November, we highlighted the fact that the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet had just surpassed the nominal GDP for the entire Japanese economy. This marked the first time in history that a central bank’s balance sheet had surpassed the GDP of the economy where the central bank resides.
But it’s not just the Bank of Japan buying up everything that isn’t nailed down. Over the last decade, the four major central banks involved in QE (U.S. Fed, ECB, BOJ and BOE) have expanded their balance sheets by nearly $11.3 trillion through various asset purchase programs.
The $64,000 question we posed back in November was, “What happens to financial markets when four of the primary buyers stop spending money like a sailor on weekend leave?”
Well, the Fed has already given us a little taste of the impact that a balance sheet reduction can have on financial markets. Over the last 12 months, the Fed has reduced its total balance sheet by approximately 7% from its October 2017 peak. In the grand scheme of things, 7% is a thimble-size reduction in liquidity, yet look at the 2018 havoc that balance sheet reduction had on emerging market economies and then ensuing crashes across emerging market currencies and equities markets.
As 2019 is getting started, everyone is trying to predict what the Fed will or will not do.
Despite all the ink spilled and airtime filled with commentary on Fed policy, no one is discussing the fact that just because the Fed stops raising rates, doesn’t mean it’s stopped tightening.
The $50 billion in bonds the Fed is currently allowing to “roll off” its balance sheet each month carries the same tightening consequences as if it actively raised rates by 0.25% every four months. 
This math tells us that regardless of what they say or do, as long as the balance sheet reduction remains in place, then we are getting three rate hikes in 2019.
Let other investors splice and dice every word uttered by Fed presidents from Kansas City to Chicago and then whipsaw their portfolio based on whether those soundbites are dovish or hawkish. The key to get an indication of the Fed’s true monetary policy stance is to keep your eye on the Fed balance sheet."

E-mini S&P (March)
Last week’s close: Settled at 2671.50, up 36.25 on Friday and up 76.50 on the week
Fundamentals: U.S benchmarks are pulling back from Friday’s rip higher. Positive tailwinds on trade have dissipated a bit, the IMF warns of slower growth, fourth quarter earnings kick into high gear this week, the government shutdown remains at a stalemate and the Brexit brings a world of questions. Last week, it was reported that the U.S was weighing lifting tariffs on China. Although these reports were almost immediately denied, it began a strong move higher. On Friday, China came to the table with a plan to eliminate the lopsided trade balance over six years. This boosted the S&P 500 to the highest level in over a month. These reports are certainly going to have an upbeat impact on the market, but the fact remains, there is no substance. Is the U.S going to allow China six years to close the gap? Furthermore, this doesn’t address key issues such as copyright infringement. The impact this news had was exacerbated by the simple fact of repositioning, which we have spoken of for two weeks; those trapped shorts from 2550 and lower are now squeezed out and under-positioned portfolio managers have chased higher. Overall, this jawboning was expected ahead of next week’s trade talks, but it was also able to hit a pressure point for this market.
Although global equity markets are in recovery mode since the Christmas lows, it doesn’t change the facts; growth is slowing. On Sunday, China’s growth figures were the slowest in nearly three decades. The IMF used this opportunity to lower their global growth forecast for 2019 from 3.7% to 3.5% citing trade tensions and rising interest rates. The World Economic Forum in Davos has kicked off and we are likely to hear more on this topic as the week unfolds.
Today is day 32 of the U.S government shutdown and the White House said every week that this goes on decreases GDP by 0.1%. Furthermore, the economic calendar is sliming which makes it harder to understand where U.S growth is and next week’s Q4 GDP report is all but postponed. Durable Goods data is the latest casualty; however, we do get Existing Home Sales at 9:00 am CT. This sheds additional light on an already pivotal earnings season. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are both down about 1.5% after reporting this morning and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) leads after the bell.
Lastly, a world of questions surrounding Brexit will not help the risk-appetite; U.K Prime Minister May is trying to find support for her Plan B after a historical defeat last week while the opposition party is pushing for a second referendum on leaving the EU. A hard Brexit in March would certainly be detrimental to global markets but going back to the polls could easily have the same effect.
Technicals: On Friday, we neutralized our bias in a wait and see mode given the news flow and short-squeeze but did not deter from our exhausted rhetoric. With the market extended on Friday, we began reintroducing our bearish bias at the trade desk as it neared our rare major four-star resistance. Repositioning has brought a vicious tailwind, one that we feared as price action extended above 2600. However, we still see the upside extremely limited in the near and intermediate-term. Today, minor support comes in at 2643.75-2646.75. Below there is major three-star support at 2632-2635.25; this aligns multiple key technical indicators including the gap close from Thursday and we expect this level to get tested over the next 24 hours.
Bias: Neutral/Bearish
Resistance: 2686.50-2690.50**, 2706-2715****
Pivot: 2656.50
Support: 2643.25-2646.75*, 2632-2635.25***, 2619.25-2626.50**, 2602.50-2605.25***
Crude Oil (March)
Last week’s close: Settled at $54.04, up $1.68 on Friday and up $2.13 on the week
Fundamentals: Crude oil is a dollar from Friday’s settlement with the February contract falling off the board today. China’s GDP figures on Sunday were in line with expectations but still at nearly 30-year lows. The IMF responded by giving a stark reminder growth is slowing, they lowered their 2019 and 2020 forecasts. We have also seen tailwinds for risk-sentiment dissipate a bit in this new week. Monday’s holiday pushes out inventory data with API after the bell tomorrow and the official EIA data Thursday. These numbers will come at a pivotal time as price action has run into a wall of resistance and the jawboning from both OPEC and on the U.S-China trade front begin to dissipate. We maintain that crude oil cannot breakout above $55, but will hold $50 without seeing a change in the inventory trend.
Technicals: Price action is developing a sharp reversal on this extended-hours holiday session. First key support comes in at $52.81-$53.03, this is a strong level, however, too high in order to be a major three-star support. Below here, second key support aligns with Friday’s low and a move through here would secure an outside bearish pattern. We have introduced a bearish bias and only a close back above $54.04 will negate this potential rollover.
Bias: Bearish/Neutral
Resistance: 54.04**, 54.55-54.98**, 55.51-55.55***
Support: 52.81-53.03**, 52.13-52.37**, 49.98***
Gold (February)
Last week’s close: Settled at $1,282.6, down $9.70 on Friday and down $6.90 on the week
Fundamentals: Gold traded lower through the holiday trading hours Monday and is attempting to stabilize this morning. The U.S Dollar Index remains elevated which is weighing on gold, but the metals weakness comes more so from the Chinese yuan which has lost ground for four straight sessions tallying about 0.5%. This does not fundamentally change our narrative; we remain unequivocally Bullish Gold.
Technicals: We have pounded the table on capitalizing on recent strength in order to welcome potential weakness. That weakness is beginning to arrive, and price action is battling at first key support at $1,278.1-$1,282.3. Traders must prepare to buy into major three-star support at $1,260.8-$1,263.8. Our momentum indicator today comes in at $1,279.7 and it is favorable that price action is above here, however, only a close out above $1,289.6-$1,292.3 is bullish in the near-term.
Bias: Bullish/Neutral
Resistance: 1289.6-1292.3**, 1298-1300***, 1313-1320**
Support: 1278.1-1282.3**, 1270.3**, 1260.8-1263.8***, 1250-1256.4**, 1245.3**, 1236.2-1236.7***"
187,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",Yen at Major Pivot Area,"There is a potential technical battle brewing in the USD/JPY currency writes Fawad Razaqzada.
After a quiet Monday, the markets were already looking livelier this morning and volatility could rise further once U.S. market participants come back from their long weekend break. Overnight, risk sentiment turned slightly sour with Asian stocks falling, which led to a weaker open for European markets.
Apparently, this was in part because of news the International Monetary Fund cut its world 2019 GDP forecast and Canada announced that the United States will proceed with extradition request for Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of the CEO. Huawei is accused of violating U.S. sanctions with Iran and the news has the potential to intensify tensions between China and the United States, although with the trade talks continuing it is just a side issue for the time being.
In FX, risk-sensitive commodity currencies dipped, and the yen strengthened, while the pound found mild support from positive UK data as investors continued to price out the prospects of a hard Brexit. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped as the yen (JPY/USD), pound (GBP/USD) and euro (EUR/USD) gained ground. This, together with a slight risk-off tone in equities, helped to underpin gold. The slight weakness of the dollar played no part in crude oil prices, however, which fell along with equities. Looking ahead, there isn’t a lot on the agenda in terms of economic news from North America. Perhaps, the only exception is U.S. Existing Home sales. But unless it beats or misses expectations by a big margin, it is unlikely to move the dollar much.
Given the slight weakness in both the dollar and equity markets, the risk-sensitive USD/JPY is among the interesting pairs to watch for further developments today. Yesterday, it turned lower from the lower end of the key 109.80-110.15 resistance range. This area had been the last significant support prior to the sharp breakdown at the start of this year. So, there is the potential for rates to break down from this resistance zone again. However, while the trend is admittedly bearish, price is at resistance and I am not very keen on the dollar anyway. So, it would make sense to expect the USD/JPY to turn lower from here. But the v-shaped recovery after that flash crash on Jan. 3, and the subsequent follow-up technical buying makes me wonder whether it has more room to the upside. Thus, I would like to see a clean breakdown first before turning bearish on this pair.
From a bearish point of view, a break below the 109.10 support is a prerequisite now. Bears would ideally like rates below 108.00, for that will create a new short-term lower low. However, if my concern is realized and rates push above the aforementioned 109.80-110.15 area first, then in that case, the recovery could go on for a while yet, with the 200-day moving average at 111.55 being among the potential targets for the bulls. At the time of writing, the USD/JPY was testing a potential support at 109.40, so by the time you read this, there was the possibility that the motion higher could have commenced from around that level.

188,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",Using the COT Report,"With the government shutdown halting updates to the Commitments of Traders Report—as well as many USDA reports—Andy Waldock explains how he trades off of COT data.
The partial government shutdown continues to halt the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s production of the Commitments of Traders report.
In addition to the COT, other government produced reports relevant to markets have been disrupted. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated: “Due to a lapse in Federal funding, work on National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and Office of the Chief Economist – World Agricultural Outlook Board (OCE-WAOB) reports have been suspended since Dec. 22, 2018 and remain suspended. Given the lead time required for the analysis and compilation of Crop Production, Crop Production-Annual, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE), Grain Stocks, Rice Stocks, Winter Wheat and Canola Seedings, and Cotton Ginnings reports, those reports will not be released on Jan. 11, 2019 as originally scheduled even if funding is restored before that date. The date of all NASS and OCE-WAOB releases will be determined and made public once funding has been restored.”
Since we have no new data, let’s take a brief look at the historical way the COT report has been used versus our current treatment of the data and the trading opportunities it provides.
Historically, the COT report was viewed by the masses through Steve Briese’s COT Index. The COT index provided a long-term trend following indicator. Part of this was a necessity since the COT data was initially published monthly and then, bi-weekly prior to the current, weekly reports. The COT Index approach created two problems for retail traders. First, the risk on a weekly or, bi-weekly timeframe along with the monetary swings it produced was just too significant for new traders to trade objectively. Secondly, the holding period was so long that it made recapitalization and money management a much longer-term proposition. Retail traders must be comfortable with the initial risk, and be able to trade frequently enough to re-capitalize, learn, and remain divorced from emotional attachment to any given position.
Our approach focuses on potential market turning points or, reversals. The data suggests the battle between the trend-following large speculators and the net commercial traders’ position is the key to determining a market’s next move. Will the market breach recent levels and develop a new trend? Will the speculative efforts find, “this time is not different,” and reverse course as the speculators scramble to limit their losses?
Market trends are impossible to pinpoint. However, markets are rarely in trending mode, and their general meanderings between trends can be reasonably easy to spot using the commercial traders’ business plans to determine levels of commodity supply and demand.
We distill the data down to a daily level in our hunt for overextended markets on the verge of reverting to their previously traded levels. The multi-timeframe analysis allows us to define the boundaries of our trade in terms that a retail trader can get their head around. Every strategy requires a built-in stop-loss order. Since this is a reversal methodology, the protective stops are always placed at the most recent extreme price. The ability to call the potential reversal within a day allows us to define the risk more tightly than the previous week’s range.
Finally, the broadening appeal of our treatment of the COT reports lies in the 3 to 5 period holding windows. We will spot some of the more significant turns on the weekly data and extrapolate them to your favorite commodity-based exchange traded fund. Using less leverage may be more comfortable over a month’s holding period. Meanwhile, futures traders actively watching the markets can move in and out at some of the most critical moments as the battle between commercial price discovery and speculative trend following rages.
Table shows net commercial position, recent movement, positive/negative momentum and whether the data shows a market is overbought, oversold or anticipates a reversal. (Note: Data based on last COT report from before government shutdown)."
189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:08PM ET</span>",UK finance minister backs calls for tougher bank disputes scheme,"LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond called on banks to strengthen a proposed redress scheme for small businesses, which lawmakers and victims argue is too soft on lenders.
A dispute service proposed by UK Finance, which represents banks, must include a broad range of interests and not impose a compensation cap, Hammond said in a letter released on Tuesday. 
The voluntary scheme was proposed in response to a decade of campaigning by small firms who say they were mistreated by their banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
It is aimed at companies with a turnover of between 6.5 million and 10 million pounds which is above the eligibility threshold for taking complaints to Britain's free Financial Services Ombudsman, leaving them facing a costly court case if they want to pursue a lender.
It includes a binding commitment on banks to pay compensation up to 350,000 pounds for ""historic"" complaints that date back to the financial crisis a decade ago, although the scheme could recommend a higher amount.
UK Finance, which declined to comment, is setting up a steering group to thrash out details of the new scheme, but lawmakers told Reuters this month it was too easy on banks.
Kevin Hollinrake, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for fair business banking (APPG), has said he would refuse a seat on the steering group unless concerns over eligibility, governance and claims limits were addressed. 
Hammond, in a letter to UK Finance Chief Executive Stephen Jones, emphasized the need for the steering group to have ""balanced representation"" from banks, business representatives and other parties. 
""It is vital that different perspectives are heard during this implementation stage, to ensure that the schemes are regarded as truly robust and independent,"" Hammond said in the letter, which was dated Jan. 19.
Banks' ""default position"" should be to pay whatever sum the new scheme awarded in compensation, Hammond said.

The APPG welcomed Hammond's comments, saying: ""We are particularly pleased that the Chancellor has set an expectation that the bank's default position should be that there is no cap on the amount of compensation awarded.""

200,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 12:14PM ET</span>","Wall Street slips on global growth fears, weak corporate forecasts","By Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent on Tuesday and were on course to end a four-day rally on fears of slowing global growth after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook and weak forecasts by companies, including Johnson & Johnson. 
The IMF forecast stalled a strong rally in stocks that was spurred by hopes the United States and China would resolve their trade dispute and dovish comments from the Federal Reserve.
The grim outlook on Monday was followed by China data that confirmed its slowest growth rate in 28 years, adding to fears that a slowing global growth could hurt U.S. corporate profit.
""It's a risk-off trade today and a lot has to do with just concerns over global growth,"" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) fell 1.7 percent after the healthcare giant forecast weak 2019 sales, pushing the healthcare sector (SPXHC) 0.87 percent lower. The Nasdaq Biotech index (NBI) dropped 1.72 percent.
All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower and five of them, including industrial (SPLRCI) and technology (SPLRCT) sectors, slipped over 1 percent. Both sectors include companies with big exposure to overseas business, including in China.
Chip stocks took a beating, with  Lam Research Corp  (O:LRCX) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) leading a 2.44 percent decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX). 
Pressuring industrials the most was a 13.5 percent slide in shares of Stanley Black & Decker Inc (N:SWK) after the hand tools and hardware maker forecast 2019 profit below analysts' estimates.
""Earnings haven't been that bad, but everyone is focusing on the forward guidance and companies are releasing downward or subdued guidance,"" said Nauman.
About 12 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported results so far and analysts have lowered their fourth-quarter earnings forecast for S&P 500 companies to 14.1 percent year-over-year growth from 20.1 percent estimated on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Despite the day's drop, all the three major indexes were still holding gains above their 50-day moving average prices, a closely watched level of near-term momentum. 
At 11:42 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 251.77 points, or 1.02 percent, at 24,454.58, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 30.90 points, or 1.16 percent, at 2,639.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 93.92 points, or 1.31 percent, at 7,063.30.
The energy sector (SPNY), the S&P's worst performing sector last year, slipped 2.08 percent, as oil prices fell on worries of lower fuel demand from China, the world's second largest consumer. [O/R] 
Halliburton Co's shares (N:HAL) fell 5.4 percent after the oilfield services company forecast lower revenue in key business areas in the first quarter, overshadowing a quarterly profit beat. 
 Arconic Inc  (N:ARNC) fell 17 percent, the most on the S&P 500, after the aluminum products maker said it was no longer pursuing a sale.
EBay Inc (O:EBAY) jumped 7.2 percent, the most on the S&P 500, after hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value urged the ecommerce platform to sell certain assets and restructure. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.30-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 22 new lows.

Elsewhere in Europe, Spain and Italy remained tough spots amid competitive pressures and challenging economic conditions but Brazil continued to improve.
Fourth-quarter sales came to 22.6 billion euros (25.7 billion), broadly in line with expectations.
Growth reached 1.9 percent on a like-for-like basis excluding fuel and calendar effects, against 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. In France alone, hypermarket sales were down 2.2 percent.
Carrefour is in the midst of a five-year plan it launched a year ago to cut costs and jobs, boost E-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China with Tencent (HK:0700) in a bid to boost profits and revenues and help it tackle competition from Amazon (O:AMZN). It kept all its targets under the plan.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: The shareholder puzzle facing airlines after Brexit,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Airlines that will no longer be majority owned by EU nationals once Britain leaves the European Union face the threat of losing their right to fly within the bloc after Brexit due to share ownership rules.
While they will still be able to fly to and from the EU, operating licenses to fly between destinations within the bloc are reserved for airlines that are majority owned and effectively controlled by EU, EEA or Swiss nationals.
EasyJet (L:EZJ), Ryanair (I:RYA) and British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) are among the airline groups likely to be most affected when British shareholders are no longer EU nationals. 
They are all trying to reach the 50 percent plus 1 threshold for non-UK EU ownership, or bidding to demonstrate how else they can comply by March 29 when Britain is due to leave the bloc.
EasyJet said on Tuesday that it had increased its non-UK EEA ownership to 49 percent, one percentage point shy of meeting the threshold.
""We have the means and the tools to make sure that we will comply with all the rules and regulation,"" easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters, adding that organic growth of EEA shareholders was the preferred route but disenfranchisement was also an option.
""Compared to other airlines, we're in a good place on this.""
Many airlines have powers in their articles of association to suspend their voting rights and block share sales to non-EU nationals should they not achieve the threshold of EEA ownership after Brexit. 
They include Ryanair, which is Irish-based but has said up to 54 percent of its shareholders could be non-EU in a hard-Brexit scenario. 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
In their political declaration on their future relationship, Britain and the EU said they would negotiate a Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, and each side has said that even if Britain leaves without a deal, flights will continue. 
But a no-deal Brexit in March would mean Britain stands to leave the bloc without a transitional period in which airlines might be able to sort out their shareholdings.
The EU has said that if an airline no longer fulfils its ownership conditions as a result of Brexit, the operating license will cease to be valid, ""subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement.""
Hugh O'Donovan, a barrister at Keystone Law, said that, while there could be a late, short-term fix to give airlines more time, it seemed unlikely that the EU would soften its stance on the issue.
For its part, Britain has said that it ""would not impose nationality restrictions on the conditions for an operating license,"" leaving airlines focused on boosting their EEA shareholdings. 
IAG ""RELAXED""
Questions have been raised over whether IAG, which is over 20 percent owned by Qatar Airways, might fall foul of the rules. While famously the owner of British Airways, it is the intra-EU flights of its Spanish Iberia and Vueling brands and Ireland's Aer Lingus that would be jeopardized.
After British Airways and Iberia merged in 2011, IAG's governance structure ensured Britons held at least 50.1 percent of the voting shares in British Airways, with Spanish nationals holding a majority of voting shares in Iberia, even as the shareholdings carried minimal economic rights.
That distinction between the economic and voting rights has been cited by CEO Willie Walsh as a reason to be ""more relaxed"" about the firm's governance after Brexit. 
""You could argue that we've already done our contingency work,"" Walsh said during IAG's 2017 Capital Markets Day.
The Spanish government has said it is confident national flag carrier Iberia is a Spanish company and will be able to fly across Europe in the event of a disorderly Brexit, after the Financial Times reported that Brussels had doubts about IAG's arguments that its individual airlines are domestically owned. [nL8N1ZA3VT]
A spokeswoman for IAG said on Tuesday that the group was confident it would comply with the EU's ownership and control rules after Brexit. 
EASYJET ENGAGING INVESTORS
EasyJet said it was engaging investors across Europe to increase EEA ownership above 50 percent before Brexit. 
Founded by British-Cypriot founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, he and his family retain a 33 percent stake in easyJet and count as EEA shareholders.
Other European airlines do not have this benefit.
Ryanair has said it plans to remove voting rights from all non-EU shareholders and block them from selling their shares to non-EU nationals for a period of time if there is no deal struck before exit day.
Ryanair said it expected the restrictions would only be in place for a short period of months and that they would be eased or removed once 50.1 percent EU ownership had been restored.   
The Budapest-based but London-listed budget airline Wizz (L:WIZZ) has clauses in its own articles of association which would allow it to take similar action. 
Travel group Thomas Cook (L:TCG) said it was in ""close dialogue"" with regulatory bodies in Europe about its contingency plans, ""including any structural changes that may be required in the event of no-deal.""
Rival TUI (DE:TUIGn) said that ""it is our aim to continue our business as we do today"" and that it was ""preparing contingency measures where necessary for different scenarios, including a ""hard Brexit"". 
Ken Quinn, Global Chair, Aviation at law firm Baker McKenzie, said the EU rules on airline ownership were archaic. 

""If they can’t reach a grand deal, then they need to reach a sectoral understanding... with an eye on consumers, not on the flag on the tail of an aeroplane,"" he told Reuters.

Interviewed on Reuters' Global Markets Forum in Davos, George Oliver said that the slowdown in the world's biggest auto market would likely affect its power solutions (PS) unit, which makes and distributes about 154 million lead-acid batteries for passenger cars and light trucks annually.
""Relative to our PS business, we definitely would agree that we saw (auto) production slow (in China),"" he said in a chat with forum participants.
The Chinese economy grew at its slowest pace in 28 years in 2018, pressured by faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs.
Johnson Controls' PS unit gets three-quarters of its revenue from replacement sales of batteries, while the remaining quarter from sales to new vehicles manufacturers. China accounted for about 7 percent if its annual sales in the 2018 fiscal year.
The company has agreed to sell the PS unit to investment firm Brookfield Business Partners L.P. in a cash deal valued at $13.2 billion that it plans to complete by June.
Oliver said Johnson Controls was on track to improve its 2019 free cash flow conversion, a metric that has been closely monitored by the investment community, following the sale of the PS unit.
""We are positioned to continue our improvements and deliver stronger free cash flow in 2019,"" Oliver said expecting to tap into the potential of its remaining building technology unit, which makes heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Colfax  Corp (N:CFX) is pressing ahead with plans to sell its air and gas handling unit Howden as part of a shift to focus on the medical devices industry and has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to handle the process, four sources close to the matter told Reuters. 
An auction process for the 165-year old Scottish company, which makes heat exchangers and gas compressors largely for oil and gas companies, is expected to kick off in the coming days, the sources said.
Colfax is hoping to fetch about 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) from the sale of the business, which employs more than 5,000 people globally and has operations in 16 countries including Mexico and Canada. It employs 350 people at its main UK site in Renfrew, near Glasgow.
Howden, founded in 1854 and bought by Colfax in 2012, makes core earnings of more than 150 million pounds, two of the sources said, adding the business would mainly appeal to private equity funds due to lackluster interest amid industry buyers.
Goldman, which declined to comment, is expected to send confidential information to potential bidders this week, one of the sources said. 
Colfax was not immediately available for comment.
The sale would cement Colfax's shift from its industrial roots following the $3.15 billion purchase of medical devices maker DJO Global Inc. in November.
Colfax, which has a market value of $2.8 billion, bought DJO - its biggest ever deal - to tap growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers.
At the time, it said it would explore options - including a possible sale - for Howden, which in 2017 generated 40 percent of Colfax's total revenue of $3.3 billion.
The change of direction spooked some investors, with Colfax shares tumbling 15 percent on the news.
Colfax's founders – brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales – are familiar with the medical equipment industry as they also launched Danaher Corp (N:DHR), a key player in medical devices, back in 1984. Colfax CEO Matt Trerotola worked at Danaher before joining Colfax in 2015.

CREWE, England (Reuters) - Loss-making carmaker Bentley is on track to be profitable this year but a worst-case no-deal Brexit puts that at ""fundamental risk"", its boss told Reuters, adding that the chance of Britain leaving the EU on March 29 with a deal now seemed ""fairly low.""
Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union, the globe's biggest trading bloc, in 66 days but the government's negotiated deal was rejected by lawmakers, leaving open a number of possibilities such a disorderly Brexit.
The car industry, which employs over 850,000 people in the country, has warned that any tariffs and customs checks would hit firms such as Bentley's parent company Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as it both exports from Britain and imports vehicles and components.
Bentley, which posted a 137 million-euro loss in the first nine months of last year, is undergoing a turnaround under a new boss and is on course to return to the black, Chief Executive Adrian Hallmark said, but that plan could be undone by the form Brexit takes. 
""It's Brexit that's the killer,"" he told Reuters. 
""If we ended up with a hard Brexit... that would hit us this year because we do have a potential to get beyond break-even to do the turnaround.""
""It would put at fundamental risk our chance of becoming profitable."" 
Like fellow carmakers, the high-end brand is taking a number of steps, including building up stocks of imported parts from two days to 10 days and building a higher proportion of cars for some non-European markets in the next few months.
""We will build more cars for China or the U.S. than we would normally do in the six-month period,"" said Hallmark. 
Hallmark said he believed the company was prepared and did not plan to temporarily halt output after Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, as planned by fellow automakers Mini and Honda. 
""Carry more stock, and it's a few million (pounds) per year...If we had to stop production, then that would be a similar value per day,"" he said.

Hallmark said there are three possible outcomes on Brexit: a deal by March 29 which has a ""fairly low"" probability, no deal with ""a degree of unrest and chaos"" or an extension to Britain's EU membership.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India likely to target about $11 billion from state asset sales in 2019/20 FY - sources,"By Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is likely to seek to raise about 800 billion rupees ($11.21 billion) through the sale of state-owned assets in the next fiscal year, beginning April 1, two government sources with direct knowledge of budget discussions told Reuters on Tuesday.
The target, which is the same as for the current financial year, includes proceeds from the expected privatization of loss-making national carrier Air India, and the sale of an insurer to be created by the merger of three state-owned firms, the sources said. It will also involve the sale of units in an exchange traded fund consisting of minority stakes in about 20 state-owned companies, they said.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is currently in the United States for a medical check-up, is expected to announce the target while presenting an interim budget on Feb. 1, said one of the sources. 
The government could also sell shares in a number of state-owned companies through initial public offerings, the sources said. Possible candidates for these include Telecommunications Consultants India, Indian Railways' subsidiaries IRCTC, RailTel Corporation India and National Seeds Corporation (NSC), they added.
The government has proposed merging three state-owned general insurance companies — National Insurance, Oriental Insurance and United Insurance - and then listing the single entity.
The government failed to attract bidders for Air India when it tried to sell a majority stake in 2018. But the airline is now being restructured and to make it more attractive just over half of its debt will be placed in another company and will not be part of any future sale, one of the sources said.
The receipts target could change if the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets less of a mandate from voters in the next general election, which must be held by early May. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost some key state elections at the end of last year, opening up the possibility that it might lose power or only get returned by forming a coalition with some other parties.
""The actual receipts from the privatization program will depend how strong is the mandate of the next government, and its commitment to privatization,"" said the first official, who declined to be named as the budget details are not public.
If Modi got a strong mandate, the government could even consider selling majority stakes in some of India's many state-owned banks, the official said.
Any change would be made in a full-year budget, likely to be presented in July.
BEHIND TARGET
There are also likely to be concerns about whether the government will be able to reach the goal. With about two months to go before the current year closes on March 31, the government has so far managed to raise only 351 billion rupees, about 43 percent of the 800 billion targeted. And some of those receipts are the result of state-owned companies buying their own shares back from the government.
The government sources said they expected there would be significant progress towards this year's target in the next few weeks.
""We have not asked the government to revise down the target this year,"" said the second official.
The struggle to meet the current year’s target has promoted some bankers and credit ratings analysts to suggest the government would likely miss this year's budget target by around 200 billion rupees.
In a note last week, Care Ratings said meeting the share sale target will be challenging for the government this year given the volatile conditions in the financial markets.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 09:59AM ET</span>",P&O to change flag of UK ships to Cyprus ahead of Brexit,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - British ferry and shipping freight operator P&O will shift the registration of its UK vessels to Cyprus ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union, in part to keep its tax arrangements in the bloc, the company said on Tuesday.
P&O currently has six UK-registered ships operating on the English Channel route to France, although it announced last month it was moving two of those to the Cyprus registry and one has already been transferred.
All commercial ships have to be registered, or flagged, with a country partly to comply with safety and environmental regulations. 
The move could complicate any attempts by the UK government to secure extra space on ships to help cope with potential disruption to trade if it fails to secure a negotiated departure from the EU. 
""In advance of Britain leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019, we undertook a review of the flag status of our ships on the English Channel,"" a P&O spokesman said in a statement.
""For operational and accounting reasons, we have concluded that the best course of action is to re-flag all ships to be under the Cyprus flag.""
The spokesman said Cyprus was among the world's leading flag registries, ""resulting in fewer inspections and delays"".
He added the move ""will result in significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state"". 
""We have no plans to make any other changes, including the terms and conditions of any of our seafarers, as a result of the new arrangements.""
Such a taxation system like the EU's allows shipping companies to pay corporation tax based on the tonnage of their vessels rather than on profit. 
Industry sources told Reuters in December that the UK government had made approaches to companies including P&O, to secure back-up vessels in case Britain failed to secure a negotiated withdrawal from the EU. 
Since then, Britain has awarded contracts worth more than 100 million pounds ($129 million) in total to three shipping firms to provide extra ferries, comprising French firm Brittany Ferries, Denmark's DFDS (CO:DFDS) and a new British company Seaborne Freight.
The government has faced criticism from opposition politicians over awarding a contract to Seaborne Freight, which they said had no ships and highlighted the rush to secure ships to avoid disruptions at major ports.
When asked on Tuesday if P&O could provide space on ships if needed by the government, the company declined to comment.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson 2019 revenue forecast misses expectations,"By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Tuesday forecast 2019 sales that fell short of analysts' estimates as the healthcare conglomerate faces increasing competition for some of its older drugs.
The company's prostate cancer drug Zytiga, an important growth driver, is expected to be pressured by generic competition, while sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade has been slipping due to competition from cheaper biosimilar versions.
The company said it expects full-year sales in the range of $80.4 billion to $81.2 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $82.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the fourth-quarter, sales rose about 1 percent to $20.39 billion, topping the average Wall Street estimate of $20.20 billion, helped by double-digit percentage growth in sales of Crohn's disease treatment Stelara and cancer drugs such as Darzalex and Imbruvica. 
Strength in the company's pharmaceuticals business also offset higher costs. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company's litigation expense doubled to $1.29 billion. J&J did not provide a specific reason for the surge in litigation costs and a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
The healthcare company is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products, including baby powder, alleging that its use caused cancer.
Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing that the company knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product.
J&J has repeatedly defended the safety of its talc products, saying that decades of studies have shown them be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.
Darzalex and Imbruvica sales saw a double-digit rise in sales to $584 million and $703 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Sales of Stelara, also used to treat psoriasis, rose 33.6 percent to $1.44 billion.
While J&J has huge medical device and consumer health divisions, its pharmaceuticals unit has been its main growth driver in recent years.
J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the positive pharma outlook was tempered by ongoing growth challenges to the company's medical device and the ongoing talc litigation.
The company posted net profit of $3.04 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $10.71 billion, or $3.99 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $13.6 billion charge related to changes to the U.S. tax law.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.97 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.95 per share.
The company said it expected adjusted 2019 profit in the range of $8.50 per share to $8.65 per share, compared with analysts' expectation of $8.60 per share.

Shares of the company were down 1 percent at $129.35 in early trading.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Brazil investor group to file lawsuit against Boeing-Embraer deal,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian investors’ association Abradin said it would file a lawsuit claiming a proposed tie-up between U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) should come with a public tender offer, escalating its fight against the proposed deal. 
The group had already filed a motion last month with a São Paulo court questioning the legality of the deal and seeking to convince that court that Embraer shareholders should be eligible for a public tender offer.
In July, Embraer agreed to sell 80 percent of its commercial plane division to Boeing for $4.2 billion, as global competition escalated between the U.S. planemaker and Airbus. The deal has been approved by Embraer's board and the Brazilian government but has yet to be put to a vote by its shareholders. 
Embraer’s bylaws ensure an offer to all shareholders with a 50 percent premium over market prices if an investor buys 35 percent or more of the company.
If the deal goes through, Embraer will have to attempt to be profitable from its executive and defense divisions which have posted losses in recent years, as well as from dividends it will receive from its remaining stake in its commercial division.
""What will be left behind with Embraer will not survive in the medium term without heavy government subsidies,"" said Aurelio Valporto, president of Abradin. 
Embraer declined to comment on the matter. 
The Brazilian planemaker said this month it expected to post little to no profit over the next two years.

The proposed Boeing-Embraer deal faces challenges on multiple fronts, including from left-wing politicians and labor groups who say the tie-up would lead to job cuts. The deal has been temporarily blocked by Brazilian judges at least twice through injunctions, both of which were swiftly reversed.

The FTSE 100 (FTSE) lender said it had informed 280 staff at the office that their roles were at risk, with around 115 of the roles possibly relocating to Manchester or Liverpool in northwestern England, and the northeastern English city of Sunderland.
Barclays declined to give further reasons for the possible layoffs but British banks have broadly been pursuing deep cost-cutting initiatives in recent years in the face of intensifying competition in UK lending and tighter profit margins.
It said the landlord of Millshaw Court had also put the site up for sale with planning permission to be converted into flats.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:44AM ET</span>",IMF pessimism + trade tensions = sickly stocks,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Pessimism about global growth drove down world shares and commodity markets on Tuesday and left investors seeking refuge in the dollar, government bonds and gold.
The International Monetary Fund's warning of a darkening outlook on Monday after China's confirmation of its slowest growth rate in nearly 30 years and amid more head-scratching over Brexit continued to weigh on the mood.
European shares had followed Asia into the red with disappointing earnings from Swiss bank UBS also adding extra gloom after Europe's banking sector saw nearly 30 percent wiped off its value last year.
In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted the global economy would grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point respectively from last October's forecasts.
The downgrade mainly reflected signs of weakness in Europe, with Germany hurt by new car emission rules, Italy under market pressure due to Rome's recent budget standoff with the European Union and Brexit hanging over the bloc as well.
""We have seen a little bit of a pull back, but whether it's the IMF growth downgrade or China related is neither here nor there,"" said CMC Markets' senior analyst Michael Hewson.
He pointed to the strong and sudden rebound that markets like Germany's Dax have seen since the end of December as well as other major global indexes.
""We are at the top end of the range for this year and given the global uncertainty, investors are probably taking the view that it is probably wise to take a bit of profit off the table.""
Futures markets were pointing to a weak start for the United States later with falls of 0.8 percent for the S&P 500 and nearly 1 percent for the Nasdaq seen. 
Another development nibbling at sentiment was news that the United States plans to proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Chinese tech giant Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.
Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in early December at the request of the United States over alleged violations of sanctions on Iran. She was released on bail and is due in court in Vancouver on Feb. 6.
Asia's overnight losses had been led by Chinese shares, with the blue-chip index off 1.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei skidded 0.5 percent too, while Hong Kong and Sydney closed down 0.8 and 0.5 percent. [.SS][.T]
In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.4 percent to $0.7123, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses.
The same worries had also pushed the New Zealand dollar down for a seventh session and copper, which is used in everything from electrical wiring and water pipes to cars, drifting lower in the metals markets. 
(Graphic: Bouncebackability - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RYxKky)
BREXIT PLANS
The dollar held at a near three-week high as investors sought the relative safety of the U.S. currency.
That kept the euro pegged back at 1.1360 and reapplied pressure on the main emerging market currencies following a decent start to the year for most of them.
Sterling was a shade firmer at $1.2910 after data showed British workers' pay growth hit a new 10-year high and employment had grown by much more than expected in the three months to the end of November. 
Otherwise traders were still waiting to see whether UK Prime Minister Theresa May can push her Brexit plans through the country's bitterly divided parliament.
May had offered tweaks on Monday by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border between the British-administered province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
But she had also refused to rule out leaving the EU at the end of March without any deal.
""Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,"" said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. ""Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.""
There was demand too for the safe-haven yen with the Japanese currency last at 109.40 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393.
In commodities, the global growth worries pulled oil prices lower with Brent down 55 cents at $62.19 and U.S. crude futures off 39 cents at $53.41. [O/R]
Euro zone government bond yields also fell, with Germany's 10-year yields down at 0.22 percent from Friday's one-month high of 0.28 percent, and Spain's helped to a near six-month low by record demand at a new bond sale.

The European Central Bank holds its first meeting of the year on Thursday.

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Bull Market's Trillion-Dollar Dividend Ride Comes Back to Earth,"(Bloomberg) -- For Lode Devlaminck, it was the turning point -- the moment corporate titans and their shareholders had to pay for the excesses of the credit cycle.
In October, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV halved its dividend after the world’s largest brewer confronted mounting fears over a $109 billion debt burden. Just days later,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. slashed quarterly payments to a penny a share in a dramatic bid by the leverage-laden behemoth to bolster its balance sheet.
“Those two were like, holy cow, what’s going on?” said Devlaminck, managing director of global equities at DuPont Capital Management. “And then people started looking and screening for other companies that might be at risk next year.”
As the sugar high from U.S. tax cuts fades and earnings growth eases, Wall Street is sounding more conservative on one of the bull market’s sure-fire ways to outperformance: Corporate payouts.
In the new era of prudence, shareholders who’ve enjoyed fatter and fatter dividend checks can rest easy no longer.
IHS Markit Ltd. last week projected a “significant slowdown” in global dividend growth this year, at 5.9 percent, totaling $1.8 trillion, according to a bottom-up analysis of over 9,500 firms. Thanks in part to mounting geopolitical risks, that’s a shift from the 14.3 percent boom in 2018 and 9.4 percent the year before.
The business-information provider reckons about 11 percent of firms will announce a dividend cut this year -- an uptick of almost 100 names relative to 2018.
“I believe that dividends of leveraged companies can suffer more,” said Willem Sels, a London-based chief market strategist at HSBC Private Bank. “The excessive focus on the shareholder value at the expense of bondholder value will be more muted.”
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., for its part, reckons the S&P 500’s dividend-per-share growth will come in at 6 percent this year versus the projected 11 percent in 2018.
As higher rates weigh on companies, sacrificing such payouts may be the last resort for those on the defense after exhausting cost-cutting measures.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last month cited Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Hoist Finance AB as potential candidates for cuts after the likes of GE, AB InBev and Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) Plc.
“Some companies thought that they didn’t need to take care of their balance sheets, because they could borrow more at cheap rates,” said Jorik van Den Bos, a portfolio manager at Kempen Capital Management.
Shifting Sands
Still, for all the risk aversion in global markets, plenty of money managers are ready to support shareholder-friendly activities. Just last week Fox Corp. sold nearly $7 billion in bonds to help finance a special dividend related to its acquisition by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. And the comeback in junk bonds and risky stocks in the new year suggests late-cycle disdain for debt may be overstated, for now.
Abruptly cutting dividends can also backfire, hitting equity values and borrowing costs.
“If you just reduce the extent of your stock buyback program -- relative to a record year last year -- then I think executives would hope that this wouldn’t be punished to the same extent,” said Michael Bell, global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
All that said, treasurers have good reason to think the interests of bondholders and equity investors are increasingly aligned. With the median net debt to EBITDA ratio of the S&P 500 climbing to 1.8 times from 0.8 at the start of 2006, markets are punishing companies with elevated leverage, hurting equity holders in kind.
U.S. companies with weak balance sheets have underperformed those with strong financials in recent months, a reversal from the post-crisis trend. It’s easy to see why: Angst over corporate debt is at the highest since 2009, according to Bank of America’s most recent survey. Half of the respondents would prefer companies to use cash to improve their financials, with just 13 percent prioritizing payouts to shareholders.
The equity rout may have also given treasurers some cover, according to Kristina Hooper, chief global strategist at Invesco Ltd. “Most companies’ stock prices are at lower levels than they were a year ago, making their dividend yields higher and therefore taking pressure off companies to raise dividends,” said Hooper, who helps oversee about $888 billion of assets.
Over at DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) Capital, Devlaminck is scrutinizing how the firm’s assets are exposed to this brewing shift in corporate behavior -- and sees late-cycle risks multiplying. He prefers defensive and quality shares over those that traditionally offer higher payouts.
“Cutting back on your dividend or buyback never solves your balance sheet issue, it just stops it deteriorating, or keeps it stable,” he said. “It’s not like all of a sudden you’re this great company.""

233,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Denmark to tighten rules for bank bosses as Danske Bank hits image,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish financial firms risk problems getting financing and risk capital abroad if there is a repeat of the  Danske Bank  money laundering scandal, the country's financial regulator said, as lawmakers sought to toughen liability rules for managers.
Denmark's reputation for being ""one of the least corrupt countries in the world"" has suffered ""great damage"" from the Danske Bank (CO:DANSKE) affair, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said in a risk assessment on Tuesday.
Danske Bank is being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
""A repetition may have consequences for the ability of Danish financial companies to obtain financing and risk capital abroad and enter into other financial transactions with foreign counterparties,"" the FSA said.
Danish lawmakers are now looking for ways to tighten the liability rules for people managing the country's banks following the Danske Bank revelations and a Supreme Court ruling in another bank scandal last week. 
The court ruled that the small Capinordic Bank, which collapsed in 2010, had not been run in a way that could justify its management being liable for losses on several loan commitments, but only in a few cases.
In the Danske Bank case, former chief executive Thomas Borgen quit in September and has since set up his own management consultancy firm.
""People are very frustrated that bank managers walk from their offices with enormous golden handshakes, brush the dust off their suits and then start all over again,"" Morten Bodskov of the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, said.
His party and the Socialist People's Party have proposed tougher liability rules for bank managers than for others.
""This is an issue we will have to look further into,"" conservative business minister Rasmus Jarlov said in a text response to Reuters, adding he would take stock of the court ruling and assess if legislation should be changed.
Jarlov initiated an overhaul of financial regulation in October, prompted by the Danske Bank case, inviting input from foreign anti money laundering experts and others.
The lawmakers will also look at boosting the powers, resources and cooperation of the financial regulator, the financial crime prosecutor and the tax authorities, Social Democrat Bodskov said.
Danske Bank declined to comment.

234,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Cheniere Energy LNG,"When it comes to commodities, despite the trade war, China is the country you must focus on. Meanwhile, the Chinese are (finally) serious about curbing the rampant pollution in their country, observes Tony Daltorio, editor of Growth Stock Confidential.
That has led to China markedly cutting back on the use of coal for both power and heating purposes. As a substitute for coal, China is placing a major emphasis on natural gas.
The all-of-a-sudden big increase in natural gas demand has had almost immediate effects, particularly on the market for liquefied natural gas.
China's LNG imports jumped 46% in 2017 to 38.1 million metric tons. This was the first time that imports of LNG exceeded gas imports delivered by pipeline, according to data from the country's customs agency. China has overtaken South Korea to become the world's second-biggest importer of LNG and it is expected to surpass even Japan by the end of the next decade.
In other words, this change in China's energy mix is a long-term change. The International Energy Agency forecasts China's natural gas demand will rise upward of 4% a year through 2040, boosting LNG prices over the long-term.
Despite the trade war, this bodes well for the number one exporter of LNG from the U.S. — Cheniere Energy (LNG). It had the first U.S. LNG export terminal, which has been in operation since early 2016. As of October 31, 2018, more than 475 cumulative LNG cargoes have been exported from its SPL Project, with deliveries to 29 countries and regions worldwide.
Chiniere's first mover advantage in China is evident with the signing of a major long-term contract with a major Chinese firm. Cheniere had been selling LNG cargoes on a spot basis to China since 2016.
Last November, it signed an $11 billion memorandum of understanding for long-term LNG sales with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which is the parent of PetroChina (PTR).
And now that deal has come to fruition; CNPC will purchase about 1.2 million metric tons of LNG annually with a large portion of the purchases starting in 2023. The contract runs through 2043 and will be linked to the Henry Hub U.S. natural gas benchmark as well as having a fixed component.
This is the first ever long-term contract to supply China with U.S. liquified natural gas! This will be a long, profitable relationship between Cheniere and China. In my view, Cheniere — a conservative idea for 2019 — is a buy on any weakness from trade war worries.

Parsippany, N.J.-based B&G Foods (BGS) makes, sells and distributes shelf-stable and frozen foods in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, taking its moniker from Joseph Bloch and Julius Guggenheimer, two pickle merchants in New York City from the early twentieth century.
B&G's modern incarnation as a food conglomerate dates back to 1996. It owns more than 50 brands, including Cream of Wheat, Green Giant, Le Sueur, Ortega, and SnackWell’s.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization has been on the rise for the past three quarters, and the company generated EBITDA of $3.91 per share over the past year to support to $1.90 in annual dividends.
Meanwhile, shares of B&G Foods continues to trade at substantially lower valuations relative to the past five years.

236,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Walgreens Boots WBA,"Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA) has fallen in recent trading to a point that makes these shares especially attractive for 2019, asserts dividend reinvestment specialist Chuck Carlson, editor of the industry-leading DRIP Investor.
While international business is a bit on the sluggish side — hence the reason for the recent selloff — I like the company’s domestic business and the opportunities its drugstore and health-care-related businesses offer.
The company — a recent addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average — has beaten consensus earnings estimates in each of the last seven quarters, and I think the earnings beats will continue in 2019.
It’s no secret that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been aggressively entering markets over the last few years, much to the chagrin of legacy players in those markets. One recent market the firm has spotlighted are healthcare. Amazon recently announced it is acquiring PillPack, which presorts medications and ships them to customers’ homes in 49 states.
While the “Amazon effect” will likely loom over these shares, I think it is a mistake to automatically dump stocks because Amazon is threatening to become a bigger player in their markets. Walgreens is a formidable competitor in its respective spaces, and I suspect the stock will mount comebacks over time.
We have seen such comebacks in legacy players in certain industries that Amazon has entered, including retail and grocery stores. Investors looking for value in quality blue chips should take advantage of the weakness in Walgreens buy these shares.
The stock trades at just 10 times 2019 consensus earnings estimate, so there is plenty of value to be had in the stock. And the dividend yield of 2.5% provides a nice kicker to total-return potential.
Be aware that Walgreens offers a direct-purchase plan whereby any investor may buy the initial shares directly from the company. I have been a long-time owner of Walgreens and see these shares outperforming the broad market in 2019.

237,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- SPDR Gold and Gold Miners ETF,"Investors are shell-shocked, and with reason; the stock market plunged in its worst December since the Great Depression! This fueled uncertainty, concern and outright panic, observes Mary Anne & Pamela Aden, resource experts and co-editors of The Aden Forecast.
Most stocks were caught up in this massive decline, which is not unusual once a bear market is underway. Even though some will argue that a bear market has yet to get started because several of the major stock indexes haven't dropped 20%, we disagree.
First of all, this 20% rule was a random decision made up in recent years. It became popular and now it's supposed to define when a bear market is, or is not, in force.
The Dow Theory, however, has been around for about 100 years and it's been very reliable in identifying bull and bear markets. It triggered a bear market confirmation on December 10 and stocks have dropped sharply since then. And despite recent volatility, the bear remains in the driver's seat.
But why? We know the global economy, the trade war, and rising interest rates have been spooking the stock market. But toward the end of December, problems out of Washington also helped fuel the bear. This was not the case before and it marks a turning point.
The main reason why is because these problems are likely going to continue into the new year. And if they do, it's going to keep stock investors on edge and nervous, which simply isn't a good environment for stocks.
In our view, investors should go for the gold. At times like this, investors turn to gold and it's been on the rise. If the bear market in stocks continues, and it looks like it will, gold will keep rising as well. And it may prove to be the best investment in 2019.
An easy way to take advantage of this gold upmove is to buy a gold exchange-traded fund — SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD (NYSE:GLD)). It's also interesting to note that when gold rises, gold shares historically tend to outperform gold. So buying a small position in the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is a higher risk buy.

238,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Gladstone Investment GAIN,"Gladstone Investment (GAIN) is a Business Development Company — or BDC — that lends money to small businesses and pays out virtually all of its net income as a dividend, suggests Adrian Day, editor of Global Analyst.
Gladstone is a little different from most other BDCs in that it also invests in equity in these private companies, with a goal of 70% debt/30% equity. It pays its monthly dividend from the interest on the debt, with gains generated by equity paying bonus semi-annual dividends.
Like most of the BDCs, Gladstone fell sharply in December on concerns that the Federal Reserve would continue to increase interest rates. To a large extent, the concern about higher rates is misplaced.
For most BDCs, including Gladstone, the vast majority of its loans carry floating rates, while its own debt is most fixed rate. Thus, rising rates actually widen the gap between interest cost and interest income and are arguably beneficial for BDCs, at least early on in a tightening cycle.
The bigger concern is if rising rates push the economy into a recession, when some portfolio companies may have difficulty repaying their loans. Even more than a recession, a credit crisis, such as occurred in 2008, is a more serious threat.
Such an event does not appear imminent at this time. And moreover, companies like Gladstone, that were hurt in 2008, have taken steps to secure long-term or permanent funding—such as preferred stock—that cannot be withdrawn in a credit crisis.
Gladstone’s NAV has increased consistently in recent quarters. From the beginning of 2016, it has increased from $9.25 per share to $12.29 per share, significantly above the current stock price.
Net Investment Income (NII), the number on which dividends are based, can fluctuate wildly from quarter to quarter for a range of reasons—a new transaction closes, or a loan is sold. There are also accounting peculiarities that can affect the number.
Most important is that not only has the NAV consistently increased and the non-accrual rate remains fairly stable, but the company has repeatedly increased its regular distribution rate, four times from the beginning of 2017, including in the latest quarter.
The regular monthly dividend equates to a very attractive yield of 8.76%. But in addition, the company pays twice-annual supplemental dividend, which have recently equated to almost another two months’ worth of regular dividends.
If you include these distributions, your current yield on today’s stock price if 9.99%. It should be emphasized that the amount and indeed whether there is a supplemental payment at all does depend on performance of the portfolio in the recent quarter.
The company emphasized that the adjusted NII exceeds all distributions “by a significant margin”. This confidence was also emphasized with strong inside buying after the latest quarter results were announced.
So a better than 9% yield on a stock selling at a 25% discount to its NAV make Gladstone a compelling buy for long-term income-oriented investors.

The Renault nominations committee has tentatively backed  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard to become Renault chairman, as widely expected, while Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore would take the full CEO role, two sources have also told Reuters.
Ghosn's latest request for bail was rejected by a Tokyo court on Tuesday, despite the ousted Nissan chairman offering to wear an electronic ankle tag in an unusual bid to win release after two months of detention for alleged financial crimes.

The ruling, widely anticipated, raises the likelihood that the 64-year-old executive will remain in custody until his trial, and has kept pressure on Nissan's (T:7201) French partner Renault SA to find his successor as chairman and CEO.

""By preventing merchants from shopping around for better conditions offered by banks in other member states, Mastercard's rules artificially raised the costs of card payments, harming consumers and retailers in the EU,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The Commission granted Mastercard a 10 percent fine reduction for cooperating with its investigation.
The fine is the latest in a series of actions over the past decade that the Commission, acting as the antitrust regulator for the 28-member European Union, has taken to reduce card fees for merchants.
It has, for example, taken decisions to make legally binding commitments by Visa (NYSE:V) Europe to cap the levels of interchange fees for all debit and credit card transactions within the European Economic Area.

Companies want some protection from the rise they fear they will see in electricity prices when coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants are taken off the grid in the coming years.

""We will take clear and responsible steps to compensate energy-intensive companies,"" he added.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>",'Fill or kill': the three weeks that saved Sears,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The future of Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) and tens of thousands of its employees across the United States hung in the balance in the freezing pre dawn hours last Wednesday, as Wall Street lawyers and bankers sparred over the fate of the beleaguered retailer in a 50-story Manhattan office tower. 
Working the phone from Miami, where he has an office and a 17,000-square-foot mansion, was Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert. The investor had to decide between boosting the $5 billion offer he had made a week earlier for most of the retailer's remaining assets, or letting the 126-year-old company close its doors forever.
A major sticking point: who would cover more than $200 million in costs that Sears had racked up since filing for bankruptcy in October. The company owed money for taxes and merchandise as well as fees charged by lawyers, bankers and other advisers. The advisers' fees alone had eclipsed $20 million by the end of the November and were mounting with every billable hour. Sears did not have enough money to pay all of the expenses.
Representatives for both Sears and Lampert occupied the 24th floor offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm retained by the company, in the General Motors (NYSE:GM) Building near Central Park. They guzzled coffee like it was water to stay awake, some eating discarded food that was not necessarily theirs. After three days of round-the-clock negotiations, the conference rooms had begun to smell, one adviser said. 
Time was running out. The auction Sears was holding as part of its bankruptcy proceedings had already blown past a midnight deadline set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain. Besides Lampert, the only other bidders were either looking at small pieces of the company or vying to shut it down altogether and sell off its assets.
Finally, at 2:30 a.m., in a conference room that had previously hosted discussions about the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and General Motors, a deal was clinched. Lampert would pay more than $5.2 billion to rescue Sears, acquiring the company's businesses and 425 stores and preserving about 45,000 jobs.
It was the culmination of a battle - with Sears directors and advisers on one side and Lampert and his negotiators on the other - that had begun on the last Friday in December, when the billionaire, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, made an offer to take over the company. This account of those crucial three weeks, based on court documents, securities filings and interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with the negotiations, shows how close Sears came to liquidation. 
A Sears spokesman declined to comment, and a Lampert representative said he was unavailable for an interview.
PLUNGING REVENUES
When Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart almost 15 years ago, he heralded the formation of a retailer with more than $55 billion in annual sales, nearly 3,500 stores and more than 300,000 employees. But within a dozen years, annual revenues had plunged to $16.7 billion in the face of competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
Lampert loaned Sears money over the years to keep it running, becoming the retailer's largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder. Under his leadership, Sears also spun off clothing manufacturer Lands' End, parted with 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a company Lampert created called  Seritage Growth Properties  (N:SRG) and sold its Craftsman tools brand for $900 million.
None of it worked. Sears has not turned a profit since 2010.
In September, Lampert proposed a rescue plan, but a special committee of independent Sears directors spurned it. On Oct. 15, the storied retailer, which thrived with famous mail-order catalogs and once owned the tallest building in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in White Plains, New York, federal court.
Sears listed about $7 billion in assets, which included just under 700 stores. Liabilities were more than $11 billion, including $2.6 billion owed to Lampert. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company by then employed about 68,000 people.
Sears formed a restructuring committee of independent directors and appointed veteran turnaround specialist Mohsin Meghji as chief restructuring officer. They soon faced a difficult choice. On Dec. 28, Lampert came forward with a takeover offer: he would pay $4.4 billion to acquire various Sears businesses and 425 stores. 
The offer would preserve up to 50,000 jobs. The company's creditors, such as mall owners and vendors, pushed for liquidation, which would yield a pile of cash to pay the retailer’s bills, not to mention its debts to bankruptcy lenders. 
ON THE BRINK
The company faced a court-imposed Jan. 4 deadline to determine whether Lampert's bid was good enough to compete in the looming auction. The deadline came and went. Sears directors and Lampert were at loggerheads. The retailer wanted another $80 million to cover bankruptcy expenses. Lampert refused.
On Monday, Jan. 7, the deadlock appeared hopeless, said people involved in the discussions. Drain urged the two sides to keep negotiating, but talks into the night went nowhere. 
Liquidation announcements were prepared by Sears and Lampert advisers, the people said. Sears tapped New Jersey-based Abacus Advisors Group LLC, whose chairman Alan Cohen was a longtime consultant to the company, to sell the chain's vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures.
On Tuesday, Jan. 8, Drain delayed the start of a scheduled court hearing, allowing talks to continue. When it finally began, Ray Schrock, the Weil lawyer representing Sears, had an announcement: ""We have what we believe is some very good news for Sears and its stakeholders,"" he said. 
Lampert had increased his bid to roughly $5 billion. He agreed to take on more than $600 million in additional Sears liabilities, mainly bills for merchandise and taxes, and employee severance benefits. 
'FILL OR KILL'
The following Monday morning, Jan. 14, advisers for Sears and Lampert entered the General Motors Building and rode elevators to Weil's offices for the start of the auction with the recently enhanced bid in hand. 
But that evening, Sears advisers at Weil's offices made an aggressive move: a demand known in Wall Street deal negotiating parlance as ""fill or kill."" The retailer wanted another $225 million to cover its bankruptcy costs, and Lampert needed to agree or abandon his takeover plan, people involved in the discussions said.
""The goalposts have moved,"" a lawyer for Lampert complained. 
Nevertheless, the next morning, Lampert upped his bid. ""This is not an ordinary moment,"" said Sean O'Neal, a Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP lawyer representing Lampert. ""The fate of an American icon and 50,000 employees hangs in the balance."" 
The company rejected it, deciding the offer, though better, did not prove a better alternative to a liquidation, the people said. For the second time in a week, Sears prepared to go out of business. 
That afternoon, Drain called. Cut a new deal, the judge told the advisers. Sears' expenses did not necessarily have to be fully covered, he said. Drain set a midnight deadline. ""You have no more time,"" he said, citing rising Sears expenses.
""There was a dying patient on the table,"" said one adviser involved in the discussions. ""Dr. Drain helped give it life.""
A MISSED DEADLINE
The midnight deadline passed. Then Lampert placed a call to his team, people familiar with the development said. His advisers, including Kunal Kamlani, president at Lampert's hedge fund, and Lawrence Chu, a Moelis & Co banker, soon had their breakthrough.
Lampert would sweeten his bid by roughly $200 million. He agreed to take on one of the company's bankruptcy loans, which debtors typically repay, in its entirety. He also kicked in extra cash. The $5.2 billion offer would free up yet more of Sears’ coffers for other expenses, including fees for advisers. 
The new offer also resolved other contentious points. Lampert would be allowed to use $1.3 billion Sears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed. 
At 12:45 a.m., Schrock, the Weil lawyer for Sears, said the company's board would consider the latest offer. At 2:30 a.m., he announced that Sears had accepted the bid. 

Even then, some Sears directors had second thoughts, and discussions dragged another full day and night. Shortly after 3 a.m., on Thursday, Jan. 17, Sears approved Lampert’s takeover. The auction was over.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The chief financial officer of Asia-focused bank  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) believes a second referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union could be the only way to end a paralyzing parliamentary deadlock on future ties with the bloc.
Speaking to Reuters at the Global Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Andy Halford said there was a ""reasonably compelling argument"" for handing back decision-making power to the people, in view of Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to unite warring politicians behind her controversial EU divorce deal.
Senior bank executives have until now avoided comment on the possible merits of a second referendum, after several large institutions drew criticism for their strong financial backing of the failed campaign to stay in the EU in 2016.
""The Houses of Parliament are there democratically to represent the people and therefore ostensibly the decision should lie with them,"" Halford said.
""However, in a situation where there is a gridlock in that body ... going directly to the people and hearing exactly what the people would want to do now that they have had two more years of information being fed to them -- that has a strong argument for being a way forward,"" he added. 
StanChart is one of several global lenders grappling with the redistribution of functions and staff to multiple EU outposts in a bid to keep business running smoothly after Britain leaves the EU on March 29.
The activities reflect months of planning aimed at protecting clients in the event of a disorderly British exit, which Halford said would ""seriously risk momentum in the economy"".
""... The worst thing would be to crash out in a way that has not been planned for,"" he said.
German and European regulators have granted StanChart permission to convert its Frankfurt branch into a fully-fledged subsidiary, to mitigate the impact of the loss of critical ""passporting"" rights which enabled non-EU banks headquarted in Britain to do business across the single market, Reuters previously reported.
Halford said the bank already had around 100 people in Frankfurt and was looking to move ""several tens"" more there.

Halford has served as StanChart's finance director since July 2014 and has sat on the board of British retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) for the last five years.

U.S. investors will return to the trading floor amid a string of warnings over the global economy that hit equities worldwide, as the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, officially kicked off on Tuesday.
The International Monetary Fund released its updated World Economic Outlook on Monday on the eve of the event and cut its forecasts for global growth.
“After two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters.
The IMF explained that a bigger-than-expected slowdown in China and the euro zone had forced it to cut its outlook for this year and 2020 and warned that a failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilize a slowing global economy.
The IMF’s downgrade on Monday came just hours after China reported its slowest quarterly economic growth since the financial crisis and its weakest annual expansion since 1990.
“Concerns over slowing global growth are starting to filter through to financial markets,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia.
On the U.S. economic front, the partial government shutdown will postpone the publication of durable goods orders, but investors will watch the release of existing home sales due at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Traders also return to their desks in a busy week for corporate earnings with no less than 60 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week.

Earlier this month, a separate source told Reuters that Elior was seeking bids by the end of January for its Areas catering business.
The source added that around 10 private equity funds - including KKR, Lone Star and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) - were considering making a bid.
On the other hand, Italian food producer and distributor Cremonini and French group Lagardere have both said they did not plan to table offers to buy Elior's assets.
Analysts value Areas - which has core earnings of about 200 million euros - at 7.5 to 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) compared to 8 to 11 times for Autogrill or Britain's SSP Group Plc (L:SSPG).
This means the deal could have a value of between 1.5 and 2 billion euros.
With 2017-18 revenue of 6.69 billion euros ($7.60 billion), Elior is well behind Britain's Compass (L:CPG) and French Sodexo (PA:EXHO) which each have revenues that are more than three times this.

LONDON (Reuters) - Litigation funder IMF Bentham (AX:IMF) has teamed up with legal experts Quinn Emanuel and Njord Law Firm and plans to file a shareholder lawsuit against  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) by July over a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal.
IMF's European subsidiary, IMF Litigation Funding Services Limited (IMF LFS), on Tuesday alleged that Denmark's largest lender breached the Danish Securities Trading Act and EU anti money laundering rules by failing to promptly inform large, institutional investors about the true scale of the crisis.
Danske declined to comment.
Around half a dozen groups have said they are gathering shareholders to sue Danske bank over a scandal that has already cost it its CEO and chairman, triggered a raft of criminal investigations. Danske's shares have plunged 49 percent since last March, wiping around $15 billion from its market value.
""The action will seek compensation for shareholders who lost millions of euros in value as a result of perceived errors and omissions committed ... and Danske Bank's failure to disclose to the market the circumstances and magnitude of alleged unlawful activities within its Estonian branch,"" IMF said.
It alleged a false market was created between April 29, 2014 and Sept. 19, 2018, when Danske published an internal report that charted how its tiny Estonian branch helped funnel hundreds of billions of euros from countries such as Russia over more than eight years. [nL8N1W51FB] 
IMF declined to name any funds it had already signed up.
The claim hinges on allegations that Danske Bank had sufficient knowledge to publish an internal report into allegations of money laundering far earlier than Sept. 19, 2018 and delayed an investigation to the prejudice of its investors.
IMF's group claim is open to investors who have accrued losses after buying Danske shares between April 29, 2014 and 19 Sept. 19, 2018. IMF will fund the case on a ""no win, no fee"" basis and will be entitled to costs and a slice of damages recovered if the case is successful.
In the United States, where claimants with a common interest can be automatically grouped together, a New York pension fund has already filed a case against Danske and four former senior executives, seeking class-action status and damages for American depositary share holders. [nL1N1Z91FC]

BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Tuesday it had received quotes from Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai electric car factory but had not signed any agreement with the Chinese firm.
Reuters earlier on Tuesday reported, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, that Tesla and Lishen had signed a preliminary agreement and were working on the details.
The companies had yet to reach a decision on how large an order the U.S. electric car company would place, and Lishen was still working out what battery cell size Tesla would require, one of the sources said. The source later reiterated that a preliminary agreement was signed. 
The second source said that the certification process for suppliers usually took a long time to be finalised. The sources declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
""Tesla previously received quotes from Lishen, but did not proceed further. We have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,"" a Tesla spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Lishen said in a faxed statement to Reuters that it had not signed any agreement with Tesla to supply batteries to the factory. 
Japan's Panasonic Corp (T:6752) is currently Tesla's exclusive battery cell supplier. Its shares closed down 2.7 percent after the Reuters report. It also announced a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Tuesday to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries. 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at the Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources. 
""Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner,"" Musk said in a tweet in November. 
Panasonic said in a statement it was studying various possibilities with regards to Tesla's Shanghai plant, but nothing had been decided. It declined to comment on the possibility of losing exclusive-supplier status with Tesla. 
Other battery makers in the running for contracts could include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300750) and LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910). 
Tesla broke ground on the $2 billion so-called Gigafactory, its first in China, earlier this month and plans to begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) there by the end of the year. 
Musk has said the factory will produce ""more affordable"" vehicles for the Chinese auto market, the world's biggest, where the firm is facing mounting competition and risks from U.S.-China trade tensions.
APPLE SUPPLIER
Lishen, which says its clients range from Apple (O:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) to Geely (HK:0175) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), has joined other battery makers in aggressively pursuing contracts with the rapidly growing EV industry.
The Chinese company started mass production of the same type of cylindrical battery made by Panasonic for Tesla's Model 3 in 2017, in the city of Suzhou about 100 km (60 miles) away from Shanghai. 
Panasonic and Toyota on Tuesday announced a joint venture that leverages the heft of one of the world's largest automakers and one of the world's biggest battery makers to expand their EV push.
The joint venture builds on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.
It would also help Panasonic cut its heavy reliance on Tesla, whose production delays have weighed on the Japanese company's earnings.

Panasonic planned to shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla would remain under the company, a source said.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 04:12AM ET</span>","Foxconn says trying to hire 50,000 people in first quarter after job cut reports","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), assembler of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhones, on Tuesday said it was trying to recruit for more than 50,000 positions across its China campuses for the January-March quarter, amid reports of mass lay-offs.
The world's largest contract manufacturer, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a stock exchange filing that changes in employee numbers were part of its usual adjustments based on global strategy and clients' needs.
Last week, the Nikkei reported that Foxconn had let go around 50,000 contract workers in China since October, months earlier than normal.
""Efforts are in progress to recruit for more than 50,000 positions across our China campuses in Q1 2019,"" the company told Reuters in an email when asked whether it was actively hiring.
The Nikkei report came weeks after Apple cut current-quarter production for new iPhones by 10 percent in the face of slowing demand in China, the world's largest smartphone market.
Chipmaker  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and other tech suppliers have also warned of a tech slowdown going into 2019.
Foxconn, which sources said makes roughly half its revenue from Apple, reported an 8 percent fall in December sales earlier this month.

At Foxconn's campus in Zhengzhou in central China, thousands of temporary contract workers and some regular staffers left of their own accord due to the lack of weekend work, trimmed overtime opportunities, and reduced or canceled peak-season bonuses, five production line workers there told Reuters last month.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 03:59AM ET</span>",U.S. to formally seek extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou: Globe and Mail,"(Reuters) - The United States will proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, Canada's ambassador to the United States told the Globe and Mail, as Beijing vowed to respond to Washington's actions.
David MacNaughton, in an interview with the Canadian newspaper published on Monday, said the United States has told Canada it will request Meng's extradition, but he did not say when the request will be made.
The deadline for filing is Jan. 30, or 60 days after Meng was arrested on Dec. 1 in Vancouver.
Meng, the daughter of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at the request of the United States over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. She was released on bail last month and is due in court in Vancouver on Feb. 6.
Relations between China and Canada turned frosty after the arrest, with China detaining two Canadian citizens and sentencing to death a Canadian man previously found guilty of drug smuggling.
Beijing has not tied any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest, but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released. Western and former Canadian diplomats have said they have no doubt the cases are linked. 
Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, said it had no comment on ongoing legal proceedings when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. A U.S. Justice Department spokesman said: ""We will comment through our filings."" 
The Canadian Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday reiterated calls for Meng's immediate release and said her case clearly was ""not a regular judicial case"".
Anyone with fair judgment would determine that Canada made a ""serious mistake"" in this matter, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing.
""Canada and the United States arbitrarily abused their bilateral extradition treaty to seriously infringe upon a Chinese citizen's security and legal rights,"" Hua said.
China ""strongly urges"" the United States to correct its ""mistake"", cancel the arrest order for Meng, and not make a formal extradition request, she added.
Asked if China would retaliate against the United States if Meng is extradited, Hua said, ""China will, of course, respond to U.S. actions."" She did not elaborate. 
""PAYING THE PRICE""
Canada is one of over 100 countries with which the United States has extradition treaties.
Once a formal request is received, a Canadian court must determine within 30 days if there is sufficient evidence to support extradition, and Canada's Minister of Justice must give a formal order.
In an article published on Monday, a former Canadian spy chief said Canada should ban Huawei from supplying equipment for next-generation telecoms networks, while Canada's government is studying any security implications.
Some of Canada's allies such as the United States and Australia have already imposed restrictions on using Huawei equipment, citing the risk of it being used for espionage.
Huawei has repeatedly said such concerns are unfounded, while China's ambassador to Canada last week said there would be repercussions if Ottawa blocked Huawei.
In Monday's interview, MacNaughton said he had complained to the United States that Canada was suffering from Chinese revenge for an arrest made at the U.S.'s request.
""We don't like that it is our citizens who are being punished,"" the Globe and Mail cited MacNaughton as saying. ""(The Americans) are the ones seeking to have the full force of American law brought against (Ms. Meng) and yet we are the ones who are paying the price. Our citizens are.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau previously said China was arbitrarily using the death penalty and called on world leaders to raise concerns about the detained Canadians.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has opened a second investigation into how accounting firm KPMG audited the books of collapsed UK construction company Carillion, the watchdog said on Tuesday.
The FRC said that KPMG, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms, ""self reported"" additional material related to Carillion's audit for year-end 2016.
The audit for that year was one of 160 company audits in the FRC's routine annual quality review.
KPMG said on Tuesday it was reviewing its response to the FRC's quality review of Carillion's 2016 audit after concerns were identified in connection with a small number of documents provided to the FRC.
""On discovery of this information, we immediately reported our findings to the FRC,"" KPMG said.
The accounting firm said it stood by its ""conclusions"" for Carillion's audit for that year and it has reached no conclusion regarding individual responsibility.
KPMG has engaged outside counsel to investigate the circumstances of the quality review and the conduct of individuals involved.
The watchdog said last year that it was investigating KPMG's audits of Carillion for 2014-2017 and the conduct of two former finance directors, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan. The second investigation was opened in November and made public on Tuesday.
""The FRC continues to progress its original investigations in relation to the collapse of Carillion in conjunction with other regulators,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
""A key area of focus has been the financial performance of Carillion's major contracts in both the construction and services divisions, and whether Carillion management and its auditors ensured that this was appropriately reported in its financial statements.""
""The investigations are also considering conduct relating to pension liabilities, goodwill, cash disclosures and going concern,"" the FRC said.
A second investigation piles more pressure on KPMG in a sector that is already in the political spotlight.
Carillion's collapse angered lawmakers who called on the Competition and Markets Authority to consider breaking up the ""Big Four"" accountants to increase competition and audit quality.
It also raised questions about the FRC's ability to police accounting firms quickly and effectively.
Last month two government-sponsored reports recommended replacing the FRC with a new watchdog, and forcing large, listed companies in Britain to hire two auditors.

The FRC said it was committed to completing its investigations promptly and thoroughly.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) warned of a tough start to 2019 after fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations in conditions Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti described as ""historically tough"".
The first major European bank to report results said client activity in the first quarter of 2019 would be affected by a ""lack of progress in resolving geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism and trade disputes along with increased volatility.""
These factors had already weighed on investor sentiment and confidence in the second half of last year, Switzerland's biggest bank said.
Overall, the bank generated $862 million in fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings, missing analyst expectations for $985 million in its own consensus report, hit by an outflow of funds in its flagship wealth management business and a slide in investment bank earnings. 
Shares fell around 4 percent in early trade.
Zurich-based UBS, which manages more than $2 trillion of the world's wealth, posted a 22 percent dip in fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings in its flagship wealth management business as clients reduced risk in their portfolios, traded less and built up their cash positions. 
The unit saw $7.9 billion in net new money outflows, a closely watched metric of future earnings.
The investment bank also had a torrid quarter with a fall in earnings in its trading as well as capital markets and advisory businesses.
In equities, usually an area of strength, UBS posted a double-digit percentage drop in earnings from a year earlier, bucking the trend seen at U.S. banks last week which largely had a strong quarter for stock market trading. 
""We see mid-single digit percentage downgrades to consensus earnings per share, mainly on the weak investment bank result and the lower assets under management base in Global Wealth Management,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
They added that a target to deliver a reported return on common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital of around 15 percent in 2019 now looked difficult to achieve. Its reported return on CET1 capital stood at 14.2 percent for 2018.
Full-year net profit rose to $4.897 billion from $969 million in 2017, when a one-off 2.9 billion franc hit from U.S. tax reforms dampened results. Five analysts polled by Reuters on average had forecast a net profit of $4.906 billion for 2018.
The bank proposed a dividend of 0.70 Swiss francs for 2018, up from 0.65 Swiss francs the prior year, and said it aimed to buy back up to $1 billion in shares in 2019.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court has suspended the financial regulator's disciplinary action against Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics Co Ltd (KS:207940) for allegedly breaching accounting rules, an official at the Seoul Administrative Court said on Tuesday.
In November, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said the biotech arm of Samsung Group intentionally breached accounting rules ahead of its 2016 listing. It called for the firm's chief executive officer and chief finance officer to be fired, imposed fines, and requested the firm correct its balance sheet.
Samsung BioLogics filed an administrative lawsuit at the Seoul Administrative Court to nullify the watchdog's findings and sought an injunction to halt any disciplinary action until the court rules on the matter.
""The court concluded that an immediate sanction on the company could lead to irreparable damage when its violation of accounting standards has yet to be proven in court,"" the court official said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The FSC in a statement said it will review details of the court's ruling and plan whether to immediately file an appeal.
Samsung BioLogics, which has denied wrongdoing, confirmed the court's decision to suspend any sanctions.
""The court's decision is fortunate. We will do our best to prove the legitimacy of the company's handling of accounting,"" a Samsung official said by telephone.
Samsung must now await the outcome of the prosecutors' investigation, the timing of which is unknown.
Samsung BioLogics' head office was raided by South Korean prosecutors last month as part of a criminal probe into alleged accounting fraud after the financial regulator filed a complaint.
Shares of Samsung BioLogics were suspended following the regulator's findings, and resumed trading in December after the bourse decided the company was qualified to remain listed.
The stock was up 0.1 percent on Tuesday, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in the Kospi benchmark share price index (KS11).

His Shanghai-based ChangAn Xinyi Enhanced Mixed Fund has increased its assets over the past two weeks by shunning Chinese stocks for bonds. And it was the best-performing of nearly 3,000 mixed funds ranked by Haitong Securities for 2018, returning more than 14 percent.
""I don't dare say it's already the bottom of the stock market,"" Du said.
He's not alone in favoring Chinese bonds over equities. Slowing growth signals an earnings slump after a brutal 2018, when the Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) tumbled 25 percent. 
For some, bonds retain a shine as policymakers combat the slowdown with more stimulus. The phased inclusion of some Chinese bonds in global indexes starting this year also should draw inflows.
""We believe this year will be another bullish one for bonds,"" said Du.
According to Shanghai consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, assets under management (AUM) at domestic equity mutual funds shrank 12 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to 194 billion yuan ($28.62 billion) while fixed income funds expanded 20 percent to 3 trillion yuan.
That was one factor driving yields on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds down nearly 40 basis points in the quarter. (CN10YT=RR) 
More policy easing could further cut yields, implying more gains for bondholders.
On Monday, China reported 2018 growth was the slowest in 28 years, at 6.6 percent. Beijing will reduce its 2019 full-year growth target to 6-6.5 percent, from around 6.5 percent last year, sources have told Reuters.
PUMPING CASH 
While authorities rule out ""flood-type stimulus"" to juice growth, they have pumped cash into the banking system to boost lending. China made a cut to banks' reserve requirement ratios this month, and more is promised.
Josh Sheng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management, says fresh cash should fuel further gains in bonds, both sovereign and corporate. At the same time, he is watching credit data for signs of an investment pick-up that could support the stock market.
Interest in Chinese bonds isn't limited to domestic investors.
Lenny Kwan, a portfolio manager at T Rowe Price in Hong Kong, is bullish on five- and 10-year government bonds. Edmund Goh, Asian fixed income manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai, is keen on corporate bonds, largely shunned by foreign investors unfamiliar with the Chinese market.
Offshore interest is likely to increase in April, when the Bloomberg-Barclays Global Aggregate Index begins to include Chinese government and policy-bank bonds.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) estimates the inclusion, which will be phased in over 20 months, could bring $50 billion in passive inflows into China's fixed income market this year. It said offshore investors could own up to 2.8 trillion yuan of onshore bonds by the end of 2019, or 1 trillion yuan more than at the end of last year. 
CREDIT BOMBS
Not all domestic investors are convinced. Fresh funding has been only enough ""to fill the old gaps,"" and the People's Bank of China is keen to avoid excess cash putting pressure on the yuan, said Yun Xiong, partner at Leiton Capital in Shanghai.
Last year brought a record number of defaults, according to Reuters data, and ""credit bombs will continue to explode"" in 2019, Xiong said. 
Another factor that could dent bonds is stricter insurance industry rules that took effect in 2018. Huachuang Securities said these reduced returns from insurance products and raised costs for insurers - traditionally big bond buyers. On top of this, weak income growth and rising household debt will hit growth of premiums. 
Some asset managers see more value in Chinese stocks than bonds, believing that more stimulus is coming and that the U.S. and China will resolve their trade war.
Last year's market correction led Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Greater China investments at Barings, to pick up a range of stocks.
Shares on mainland exchanges are ""trading at about 11 times (price to earnings). That's very low,"" said Do, who expects China's economy to rebound in the second quarter. 
Wang Qing, president of Shanghai Chongyang Investment Co, is also optimistic that China shares will rise this year. 
""Market consensus at the start of a year is often wrong,"" he said.

275,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>","U.S. Still Seeking Huawei CFO's Extradition, Canada Envoy Says","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. has indicated it will pursue the extradition of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive, Canada’s ambassador to Washington said, suggesting the case might not be resolved in trade talks with China.
Ambassador David MacNaughton confirmed in an email Monday that U.S. officials have continued to signal an intent to follow through on the case against Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. The Globe and Mail newspaper earlier cited an interview with MacNaughton saying that the U.S. has notified the Canadian government of plans to file a formal extradition request before a Jan. 30 deadline.
Meng -- the daughter of the Chinese telecommunication giant’s founder -- was arrested at the behest of the U.S. last month over allegations of bank fraud related to sanctions against Iran. She has denied wrongdoing and is restricted to staying in Vancouver while awaiting further court hearings.
The case -- and China’s subsequent detention of two Canadian nationals -- has prompted a diplomatic feud between Ottawa and Beijing, with each side accusing the other of arbitrary law enforcement. The dispute was complicated by a Trump interview with Reuters on Dec. 11, in which he said he would intervene in the case, if he “thought it was necessary” to close a trade deal with China.
The deadline falls on the same day that China’s top economic official, Vice Premier Liu He, is due to arrive in Washington for talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Huawei has been a central concern of U.S. efforts to protect intellectual property rights and secure sensitive data systems.
Still, Canadians in China have suffered the most since Meng’s Dec. 1 arrest. China detained Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor on suspicion of activities endangering national security while another Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, saw his drug-smuggling sentence increased to death from 15 years in prison.
MacNaughton told the Globe and Mail he had voiced Canada’s anger to the Trump administration over the dispute.
“We don’t like that it is our citizens who are being punished,” MacNaughton said in the interview.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 11:48PM ET</span>",Tokyo court denies latest bail request of Nissan's Ghosn,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's latest request for bail was rejected by a Tokyo court on Tuesday, despite the ousted Nissan chairman offering to wear an electronic ankle tag in an unusual bid to win release after two months of detention for alleged financial crimes.
The ruling, widely anticipated, raises the likelihood that the 64-year-old executive will remain in custody until his trial, and will put pressure on Nissan's (T:7201) French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to find his successor as chairman and CEO.
Renault's board is expected to meet in the coming days to decide who will succeed Ghosn, essentially removing him from the three-way alliance - which also includes Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) - which has been in turmoil since his arrest.
Ghosn was almost immediately ousted from the chairmanship of Nissan and Mitsubishi after his initial arrest on Nov. 19, but remains chairman and CEO of their French partner. 
He has been officially charged for under-reporting his salary for eight years through March 2018 and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. Ghosn denies the charges.
The court did not give a reason for the denial. Bail is rarely granted for defendants in Japan without a confession.
Ghosn's lawyer was not immediately available for comment after the Tokyo District Court announced its decision. 
Ghosn's latest bail request had also included an offer to hire guards to monitor him and a promise to remain in Tokyo, where he has leased an apartment. He offered to post stock he owns in Nissan as collateral, his spokeswoman said. 
An earlier request for bail was denied last week due to concerns the executive, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, was a flight risk, and that he may tamper with evidence if released.
In a statement released on Monday, Ghosn repeated his intent to clear his name in court. 
""I will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,"" he said.
""I am not guilty of the charges against me and I look forward to defending my reputation in the courtroom."" 
PARTNERSHIP IN TURMOIL
The arrest of the once-feted executive who orchestrated the turnaround of Nissan two decades ago, has clouded the future of the partnership between Nissan and Renault. 
Ghosn had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm.
On Monday, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' complicated capital ties. Local media have reported that a French government delegation has informed Tokyo that it would seek an integration of Renault and Nissan, most likely under the umbrella of a single holding company.
Renault owns a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent stake in Renault. The French government owns a 15 percent voting stake in Renault.

Nissan, which has been conducting an internal probe into misconduct by Ghosn, believes he misused company funds for personal purposes, including payments related to his compensation, his residences dotted around the globe, and payments to family members, people with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters.

The omission extends the uncertainty over the outlook for Tencent, which was the highest-profile victim last March of government measures to crack down on online gaming in response to fears about addiction and exposure to violence among young people. Tencent gets nearly 40% of its revenue from online gaming. 
According to the South China Morning Post, it wasn't clear why there were no Tencent titles on a list of 93 approved games announced by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television on Tuesday.
Chinese regulators resumed approving games in December and this is the third list of approvals to be published since then, but there have still been no approvals for Tencent, or for rival NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), according to the SCMP.
The suspension of approvals last year created a backlog of more than 5,000 titles.
Following today's news, Tencent’s shares were down 1.9% to HK$333.6 by 11:33 PM ET (04:33 GMT). The shares have risen some 8% since the government lifted the suspension in December, but they are still down 28% from before the ban was imposed.

The Swiss-U.S. company got a boost from strong sales of its gaming products such as superfast keyboards, headphones and computer mouse used in multi-player online games like League of Legends and Fortnite.
Logitech's diverse portfolio drove double-digit growth across gaming, video collaboration and creativity & productivity, said Chief Executive Officer Bracken Darrell.
The company now expects its fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP operating income to be between $340 million and $345 million, up from its previous guidance of $325 million-$335 million.
Logitech expects sales to grow between 9 percent and 11 percent in constant currency during the fiscal year, which runs to the end of March.
The company had raised its guidance earlier in July, following big increases in sales of its products used in video collaboration, gaming and for computer tablets.
For third quarter ended Dec. 31, net income rose to $112.8 million, beating forecasts of $99.3 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Net sales rose 8 percent to $864.4 million in the quarter, traditionally Logitech's biggest sales period, beating forecasts of $852 million.

Sales from its gaming business rose 23 percent to 213.7 million.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.7% and 0.9% 9:46 PM ET (02:46 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.1%.
Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) was in focus on Tuesday as it was again absent from the list of the latest video games titles approved by Chinese authorities.
The company’s domestic rival NetEase Inc (NASDAQ:NTES) was also absent from the list.
The list was the third since December 2018. China previously approved a batch of 84 new video games earlier in January.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s KOSPI both fell 0.7%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was also down 0.7%.
Reports that the IMF forecasted the world economy would grow at the weakest pace in three years in 2019 were cited as the catalyst for the selling in equities. The Fund cited multiple threats as the reason for the downgrade, including China-U.S. trade disputes, a renewed tightening of financial conditions, a “no deal” Brexit and a deeper-than-anticipated slowdown in China.
""A range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications, especially given high levels of public and private debt,"" the Fund said.
The IMF now projects a 3.5% growth rate worldwide for 2019 and 3.6% for 2020. These are 0.2 and 0.1% points below its last forecasts in October.
In other news, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May refused to rule out a delay to the March 29 Brexit exit date.
Meanwhile, the main opposition Labour party called for a vote that could pave the way to a second referendum, according to reports.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares and U.S. stock futures slipped on Tuesday amid signs of pessimism about world growth, while sterling dithered as the latest plan for Brexit appeared to come and go with no progress.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) eased 0.1 percent but was still within striking distance of a seven-week top touched the previous day.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained 0.2 percent, helped by a recent pullback in the yen.
U.S. stock futures, which offer an indication of how Wall Street will open, were down about 0.2 percent. (ESc1) (1YMc1) (NQc1)
U.S. markets were closed on Monday so trading was generally subdued overnight. However, equity prices in Europe and Latin America were hit after data showed a slowdown in growth in China, the world's second biggest economy.
Adding to the air of caution and uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs as trade tensions loomed.
The gloomy IMF forecasts, released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, highlighted the challenges facing policymakers as they tackle an array of actual or potential crises, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit.
""This is now the second IMF downgrade in a row,"" ANZ analysts wrote in a morning note.
""And while there have been some positive developments in recent weeks, risks remain skewed towards weaker growth, with a 'no deal' Brexit and sharper-than-expected slowdown in China getting special mentions.""
""Between the ongoing US/China negotiations and the UK's Brexit impasse, market sentiment will continue to be dominated by geopolitics in the near term,"" ANZ added.
In a sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar <AUD=D3>, often used a liquid proxy for China investments, nudged down to $0.7155, putting it on track for a third straight sessions of losses.
Sterling traded cautiously as British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are few signs she can break a deadlock with parliament after her Brexit deal was rejected last week.
May offered to tweak her defeated deal by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland.
The pound fell initially as she spoke, then climbed to session highs, rising above $1.2912 <GBP=D3>. It was last at $1.2890.
""Prime Minister May's update to Parliament on how to proceed with Brexit contained little new,"" the ANZ analysts wrote.
""The strategy appears to be one of running down the clock into Brexit and it raises the probability of growing support for amendments by MPs to prevent a 'no deal'.""

The dollar <JPY=> held at 109.63 against the Japanese yen while the euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1375 (EUR=). Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at 96.336 (DXY).

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of one of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies has told leading planemakers to ""get their house in order"" and wipe out manufacturing delays before pushing already record production rates to even higher levels.
SMBC Aviation Capital's chief executive, Peter Barrett, urged caution over production increases as he confirmed a new order for 65 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo-family aircraft to secure the Japanese-owned leasing company's growth well into the next decade.
""We have been consistent with both manufacturers (Airbus and Boeing) in saying get deliveries right today ... get your production and delivery systems up to scratch,"" Barrett told Reuters.
Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) are within reach of production rates at or close to 60 aircraft a month for their best-selling narrow-body models but have struggled with late deliveries.
Both have begun exploring future output of about 70 jets a month to meet strong demand, but some of their engine makers are reluctant to back the move immediately, given difficulties experienced in switching to a new generation of fuel-saving engines.
The cautious tone on future production reflects recognition that manufacturers must first ""get their house in order"" and improve the timing and quality of aircraft already being delivered, Barrett said.
Aircraft lessors who control about half the world's fleet are traditionally cautious about production increases, fearing that a glut would knock values of assets they already own. But they have also been increasingly vocal about supply disruptions.
SMBC Aviation, the world's fourth-largest leasing company, has said the order for 65 planes first reported by Reuters included 15 Airbus A321neos, the largest medium-haul model.
Barrett said SMBC also had the option to upgrade A321neos to the longer-range A321LR version and that it is monitoring possible plans by Airbus for a longer-range A321XLR.
Industry sources have said Airbus has stepped up pre-marketing for a 101-tonne A321XLR, which would expand the use of narrow-body jets for longer transatlantic trips. It is expected to launch it by mid-year to pre-empt Boeing proposals for a new mid-market jet with 220-270 seats.
Barrett said SMBC would look at the possible new Boeing jet but its price and performance would be critical.
Aircraft financiers are meeting in Dublin this week against the backdrop of a sector concerned that a decade-long boom is faltering as uncertainty creeps into the global economy and interest rates rise.

SMBC is watching developments in China and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union for any wider economic impact but says overall demand for leased jets remains solid.

OSLO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), L'Oreal and Mitsubishi Electric are among more than 120 global firms which scored top marks in a ranking of corporate efforts to slow climate change.
Many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost 200 governments struck the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels.
But only two percent of 6,800 firms that submitted data made the ""A List"" of CDP's index, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Nestle, China Mobile [CHNMC.UL] and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
London-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, said its data showed the shares of its index leaders tend to outperform on stock markets. Companies are coming under increasing pressure from shareholders to address climate change.
CDP said the STOXX Global Climate Leaders index, based on the CDP A List, outperformed the STOXX Global 1800 of major firms by 5.4 percent a year from December 2011 to July 2018.
""We think (climate action) is a lead indicator of quality in other areas, especially sustainability and management,"" Dexter Galvin, global director of corporates and supply chains at CDP, told Reuters ahead of the index publication on Tuesday.
Galvin said it was hard to compare the 2018 results with previous years due to changes in the questions posed. As a result, a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse, he added. 
CDP asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study, which is backed by more than 650 investors with assets of $87 trillion and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet.
Galvin said CDP would in future be bolder in naming and shaming in the report, which was issued to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Among examples of efforts made by its A List companies, CDP said Danish toy-maker LEGO launched the first LEGO elements made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane.

And Korean electronics company LG Display had developed and invested in more than 150 water-related reduction technologies between 2013 and 2017, it added.

Lawmaker gives Bank of England money-saving tips","LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England was asked to consider moving the gold bars out of its vaults so that space could be rented to a pub, during its first hearing before a parliament spending watchdog.
Members of parliament's Public Accounts Committee had seized on a report by government auditors, which criticized the BoE for having more than 800 empty desks at its historic Threadneedle Street home in London's main financial district.
""If you're making it easier for staff to work ... at home, would there be any thought to renting out aspects of Threadneedle? Would we see a Wetherspoon's?"" committee chair Meg Hillier asked, referring to the popular chain of pubs (L:JDW) known for refurbishing abandoned high street premises such as banks.
But Bradley Fried, the chair of the BoE's Court of Directors, pointed out a hitch in Hillier's plan.
""Threadneedle Street is a little bit unique, in that we are sitting on top of what is literally 140 billion pounds ($180 billion) worth of physical gold, actual physical gold,"" he said.
A pub or other commercial tenant would create a security risk, he added.
Undeterred, Hillier suggested moving the gold from its high-security vaults to a cheaper location, ""to maximize income from Threadneedle Street"".

Fried, a former chief executive of Investec Bank, said the BoE was taking the more cost-effective approach of moving some staff at another nearby office to Threadneedle Street, which might allow the other building to be partly leased out instead.

SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce has accepted an offer made by Brazilian chicken exporters to resolve a dumping dispute, a lawyer told Reuters on Monday, lifting shares of Brazil-based chicken exporter BRF SA. 
Claudia Marques, a partner at MPA Trade Law who represents the Brazilian exporters, said China's decision to accept Brazil's ""price undertaking"" offer was communicated to the parties in the Ministry of Commerce's ""disclosure report."" 
The agreement, which sets minimum prices for sales to China to end a dumping probe that started in August 2017, will take effect by Feb. 18, Marques said, a date marking the end of formal proceedings.
Shares in BRF, the world's largest chicken exporter, rose 1.8 percent to 24.49 reais, a more than six-month high, after trading flat before Reuters reported the dumping case had been resolved.
According to a preliminary ruling against white broiler poultry imports from Brazil, China determined in June 2018 that importers of Brazilian chicken provide a dumping deposit ranging between 18.8 percent and 38.4 percent. 
In an effort to resolve the matter, Brazilian chicken exporters formalized the proposal to set minimum export prices for sales into China last month.
Under the terms of the offer, the exporter commits to selling to China at prices not lower than what was agreed, a process known as price undertaking.
The World Trade Organization defines price undertaking as the effort ""to raise the export price of the product to avoid the possibility of an anti-dumping duty.""

291,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 03:26PM ET</span>",Venezuela gold holdings in Bank of England soar on Deutsche deal: sources,"By Mayela Armas and Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's gold holdings in the Bank of England have jumped after it closed out a gold swap deal with  Deutsche Bank , according to two sources, as Britain remains reluctant to release gold held for the troubled OPEC nation.
The government of Nicolas Maduro has since last year been seeking to repatriate about $550 million in gold from the Bank of England on fears it could be caught up in international sanctions on the country.
Its holdings at the bank more than doubled in December to 31 tonnes, or around $1.3 billion, after Venezuela returned funds it had borrowed from Deutsche Bank AG (DE:DBKGn) through a financing arrangement that uses gold as collateral, known as a swap, one of the sources said.
Under the deal struck with Deutsche Bank in 2015, Venezuela put up 17 tonnes of gold in exchange for a loan, according to one of the sources who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.
The country's gold holdings fell to 134 tonnes in November compared with 150 tonnes at the start of 2018, according to central bank statistics.
This is in part because Venezuela last year started carrying out gold barter operations with Turkey to import food following U.S. sanctions that have made international banks reluctant to handle Venezuelan transactions.
The motivation for paying back the funds from the Deutsche swap was not immediately evident. But redeeming the swap would give Venezuela more gold for barter operations with Turkey.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Venezuela's Central Bank did not reply to an email seeking comment.
The Bank of England said in a statement that it does not comment on customer relationships. 
""In all its operations, the Bank observes the highest standards of risk management and abides by all relevant legislation, including applicable financial sanctions,"" the statement added. 
POLITICAL PRESSURE
The Bank of England is facing political pressure from Venezuela's opposition and from members of British parliament to not assist Maduro, whose just-begun second term has been widely described as illegitimate.
Losing the gold would be a significant blow to the country's finances by undermining Venezuela's ability to obtain hard currency crucial to importing items ranging from food and medicine to auto parts and consumer electronics.
But refusing to hand over the gold, which belongs to Venezuela's central bank, could cause alarm among countries that store their own bullion in the Bank of England's coffers.
Maduro's government is struggling under hyperinflation now approaching 2 million percent annually, and a broad economic collapse has fueled an exodus of some three million people since 2015.
Opposition critics, including exiled leader Julio Borges, have argued that the gold should not be repatriated because it could be used to finance corruption.
Calixto Ortega, president of Venezuela's central bank, met with Bank of England officials in December to discuss repatriating the gold but was unable to convince them, according to sources familiar with the situation.
Venezuela for decades stored gold that makes up its central bank reserves in foreign bank vaults, which is common among developing nations.
The country's late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, citing the need for Venezuela to have physical control of central bank assets, in 2011 repatriated around 160 tonnes of gold from banks in the United States and Europe to the central bank in Caracas. 

Maduro says his government is victim of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition and fueled by Washington's sanctions. His critics blame the country's struggles on a state-led economic model, stringent exchange controls and nationalization of private companies.

RPC on Friday extended the deadline to Jan, 23 for Apollo to make a firm offer or walk away.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that a deal could be announced as soon as Tuesday.
Private equity has long been attracted to the sector's reliable cash flow and growing demand from online shopping, with a spate of takeovers by bigger packaging players further spurring their interest. 
RPC, which operates in 34 countries, on Monday had a market capitalization of 3.26 billion pounds ($4.2 billion).
The company said in September that it was in talks on a possible sale to Apollo and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, with the deadlines to make a firm offer extended repeatedly since then. 
The FTSE mid-cap company ended talks with Bain in December.
RPC declined to comment when contacted by Reuters and Apollo could not be reached for comment outside normal business hours.

295,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",China is Key to Market Risk Assessment,"Slower Chinese GDP growth along with uncertainty regarding U.S.-China trade talks is driving market risk according to Bob Savage. He's presenting at TradersExpo New York March 11.
The urge to get off the road and wait out the impeding storm has been in play since 2019 started. The FOMO (fear of missing out) was countered by the JOMO (joy of missing out) in December. Memories matter less today to markets, than moods drive them, but both are in the play-offs of bulls and bears as asset markets face a heavy week ahead.
The wall of worry was climbed again last week as China/US trade deal hopes rose even as growth falls. The positioning for equities, FX and rates looks cleaner now than in the bearish start to the year but the momentum higher will need something more in the tank than hope to propel it further. In fact, the gloom over the last quarter has set into forecasts for Q1 leaving it harder to chase the market and believe in the price action. S&P 500 earnings estimates for the first half of 2019 are now the lowest in four years, according to Factset. The bottom-up EPS estimate for the first half of 2019 decreased by 4.5% (to $81.73 from $85.56) over the past three months. The price action up clashes with the mark down in earnings (see chart). 
There are other anomalies to consider:

The FOMC pause in rate hikes versus a cut and the slowing of orders and confidence and the bounce in 10-year yields against the probabilities of a FOMC rate hike in 2019. 
The weakness of survey data in Europe against the expectations of a soft-patch bounce back with German auto emissions
The optimism in commodities against the weakest growth in China in 28-years based on the hopes for stimulus plans to work again
The rally in the British pound (GBP/USD) against the worst vote outcome for a Prime Minister in the UK for over 100 years based on the hope for a Brexit delay and potentially reversal with another referendum. 

Will China stimulus be enough? 
The Chinese economic data for 4Q showed the slowest growth pace since 2009. The retail sales are near 18-year lows. Industrial production surprised to the upside, but fixed investments stalled.
Perhaps the most important headlines were about the US/China trade talks stuck on intellectual property issues. The net reaction of markets in Asia was positive but in Europe less so as the markets are in doubt of the veracity of the data and the power of the present stimulus overlaid against the fears of a breakdown in the trade talks. This puts this week and the craziness of the rally in risk against the well-worn fears listed above. The rally up in the USD/CNY overnight highlights the doubt in play and the need to hold 6.88 over the next few weeks as critical for those that yearn for the simplicity of buying and holding risk assets. 
The feel-good moment for Asia post-GDP release came with the surprise uptick in China industrial production. The distraction is that electricity production zoomed higher while other things were less positive. The ability for China to grow out of the middle-income trap, to move from investment led to domestic led growth and to have a centrally controlled economy dictate the best allocation of resources for growth all that is in doubt and in play for 2019. The stimulus hopes, post the data release, remain central to global markets in 2019. The key concern is that the private sector is no longer part of the growth story (see chart)."
296,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>","Stocks Bulls, Let the Good Times Roll","There is no guarantee that stock prices will continue to rise. …But for now, the path of least resistance seems to be up,” writes Joe Duarte.
New wave rockers, The Cars, in their early hit: “Let the Good Times Roll,” sang about the carefree ways of the young. In a sense, the song is about going with the flow, adapting to the moment, and taking life one day at a time - “let them take you up in the air, let them brush your rock n’ roll hair.” And that roll with it attitude may be useful in this market, especially if the good times roll over in the next few days to weeks.
Arguably, and perhaps for good reason, the good times vibe is not universal. There are still plenty of investors who remain on the sidelines, living in the recent past and licking their wounds after the fourth-quarter massacre.
And there is nothing wrong with learning the lessons of history, especially the lessons of such a painful period. Yet, from a trading standpoint you can’t take this stuff personally - you’ve got to know when to let go. And until proven otherwise, it makes sense to stick with what’s working right now, which is to be long stocks in the right sectors. Currently that means owning select semiconductors (TXN, AMAT, MU), biotech, (BIB), and select international ETFs such as the IShares Brazil ETF (EWZ).
Still as we learned in October 2018, balance and prudence are the keys to success. Moreover there are some positives beyond stock prices to consider. Perhaps the most interesting development of the last week was that a key barometer of the stock market rose above a key resistance level, which — unless conditions are reversed — signals we are back in a bull market phase. Furthermore, with the Federal Reserve on hold and the Chinese central bank in easing mode, money is returning to global stock markets. Furthermore, as I mentioned last week, it would not be a big surprise if there may be a positive surprise coming from the U.S.-China trade talks.
This combination of influences makes for an interesting decision point for those investors who have been skeptical of the recent bounce in stocks and have missed the opportunity to accrue sizeable gains in a short period of time. Accordingly, given that there is so much lingering doubt about this market, and with so many having missed the rally, it seems as if it still has some upside left.
Of course, there is no guarantee that stock prices will continue to rise. And yes this rally will eventually roll over. But for now, the path of least resistance seems to be up, although the potential for daily volatility is likely to rise with earnings season moving into full swing.
But it’s more about what happens after earnings than the earnings itself as investors will start to focus on revenues and forward guidance. Moreover, since time heals all wounds, the longer the bears get whipped, the lower will be the odds of a return to the bearish trend and the higher the odds that money will continue to move into stocks at least in the near term. This is especially true given the way that robot trading algorithms accentuate the major trend of the moment, which is up.
Market Breadth Rises Above Key Resistance Line
The New York Stock Exchange Advance Decline line (NYAD) has been the most accurate indicator of the general trend in the U.S. stock market since the 2016 presidential election. It certainly and correctly predicted the decline in stocks over the fourth quarter on 2018.
Now that NYAD crossed back above its 200-day moving average, investors should pay close attention to what happens next. If the advance decline line consolidates or moves further above this line, it would signal a sustainable return to a bull phase in the market. By the same token, a failure of this crossover to hold would likely signal that stocks are once again heading lower.
Indexes to Test Key Resistance
The NYAD has crossed above its 200-day moving average but the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) indexes have not confirmed this event, although they are within reach of the key chart point. Furthermore, both SPX and NDX have crossed above their 20- and 50 -day moving averages, which is encouraging.
Nevertheless this sets up a conundrum for technical investors. Certainly NYAD has been the more pivotal indicator since November 2016 but at some point, it would be comforting to see the indexes confirm the uptrend.
Specifically, I am focused on SPX and NDX and their 200-day moving averages because most human technicians seem to ignore this traditional dividing line between bull and bear markets, but the robots don’t. In fact a review of the SPX chart clearly shows that during the Q4 decline, the index tried to remain above this key long-term moving average three separate times. On the third attempt it failed and the selling accelerated. Thus I expect a challenge of that key resistance level before the market makes its intermediate term decision.
For now Accumulation Distribution (ADI) and On Balance Volume (OBV) suggest money is moving into stocks while ROC, which measures momentum suggests that we are getting close to being overbought. Altogether, this group of indicators suggests that we may have one or two more weeks left before things start getting a little dicey.
This Time Really is Different
I get it. There may be some dark clouds on the horizon. Believe me, I am not a born again bull and I don’t trust this market any more than any other market over the last 30 years. I just trade with the trend. Nevertheless, given the volatility and the speed with which prices can move I have learned that this is a much different market than the one I started trading in 1987.
Still there are some constants. One is that human nature doesn’t change –greed and fear still rule the Wall Street roost. That means that there are going to be some hedge fund managers who have missed the rally and whose clients are withdrawing money from their accounts. According to recent reports, there was $20 billion in hedge fund withdrawals in Q4. These managers are more likely than not to throw in the towel fairly soon and start buying stocks before they miss any more of the rally.
And as I noted above a review of leading price charts confirms that the technical aspects of this market are pretty good right now. Thus for hedge fund managers, there is no survival if they don’t keep up with the market, or have any customers. After all, adapting is the first stop in the road to survival.
Given the potential for surprises and unintended consequences, it still makes sense to keep a short-"

The QuantCycle Indicator is revealing a short-term consensus pull-back for all the major U.S. stock indexes. It is interesting because a lot of technical noise has been indicating the recent rebound in equities is running out of gas.
The 240-minute chart for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq 100 and all indicate short-term weakness.
The Nasdaq 100 appears to be the weakest signal, which is a confirmation of sorts because it has led the other indexes in recent years.
This is a short-term signal as the daily QuantCycle Indicator for the E-mini S&P 500 is still trending higher—though close to overbought territory—until April (see chart).
The QuantCycle indicator is a technical tool that employs proprietary statistical techniques and complex algorithms to filter multiple cycles from historical data, combines them to obtain cyclical information from price data and then gives a graphical representation of their predictive behavior (center line forecast). Other proprietary frequency techniques are then employed to obtain the cycles embedded in the prices. The upper and lower bands of the oscillator represent a two-standard deviation move from the predictive price band and are indicative of extreme overbought/oversold conditions."

306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Ex-Swiss banker convicted for selling secret tax data to Germany,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - A former UBS (S:UBSG) banker accused of selling information about wealthy German tax evaders to German authorities was convicted of economic espionage by a Swiss court on Monday.
Rene S., as the 45-year-old ex-banker was called during court proceedings, was sentenced to 40 months in prison and must pay fines and court costs totaling more than 125,000 Swiss francs ($125,300) after being found guilty of charges that included spying and money laundering. 
Rene S., who according to court documents has moved to a small town in Germany just across the Rhine River from Switzerland, did not attend the proceedings in Bellinzona this month. 
He was acquitted of breaking Swiss banking secrecy laws. It was not immediately clear whether Switzerland would seek his extradition, with Swiss officials in Berne saying such a decision would come only after the appeals process had been exhausted and the judgment finalised.
The case is part of a decade-old dispute between Germany and Switzerland over untaxed assets, a fight they hope will fade now that both countries have joined more than 100 others in agreeing to automatically exchange financial data about their residents' international accounts.
Switzerland, whose banks have paid out billions to other countries to settle charges they helped foreigners hide wealth, has aggressively prosecuted whistleblowers who leak banking data.
Prosecutors said that between 2005 and 2012, when Rene S. worked for UBS, he illegally collected data about Germans with accounts at the bank and sold the information for 1.15 million euros ($1.31 million) to tax authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia who were seeking to root out tax dodgers.
Rene S.'s lawyer, Moritz Gall, said he expects to appeal. Throughout the trial, Gall has maintained his client's innocence.
Neither the defendant, who is a Swiss citizen, nor his family could be reached for comment. 
Lawyers for UBS, which paid some $300 million in 2014 to settle claims it helped wealthy Germans evade taxes, had contended during the trial that its former employee's actions had undermined Switzerland as a financial center.
UBS declined to comment after Monday's verdict.
A decade ago, Germans were believed to be hiding about 150 billion francs in secret accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. 
But thousands began declaring their assets after North Rhine-Westphalia, with the federal government's blessing, started buying covertly collected data.
North Rhine-Westphalia has spent some 17.9 million euros since 2010 on data that helped it recover nearly 7 billion euros ($7.97 billion) in tax revenue.
In turn, Switzerland fought to protect its banking secrecy laws by prosecuting several people, including Rene S., in separate cases where it accused them of illegally handing over documents. [https://reut.rs/2VDzkHs]
The dispute has included several twists, including the Swiss filing criminal charges in 2012 against three German tax collectors, accusing them of buying account information from informants.
And in 2017, Germany arrested a Swiss man they accused of spying on North Rhine-Westphalia's tax authority, forcing Switzerland's spy agency to defend its practices against friendly neighboring countries. The accused Swiss spy got a suspended prison term. [https://reut.rs/2FfZgUt]

316,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Private equity firms circling Nestle's skin health business - sources,"By Arno Schuetze, Pamela Barbaglia and Martinne Geller
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firms Cinven and Advent have teamed up to bid in an auction that could value Nestle's (S:NESN) skin health business at about 7 billion Swiss francs ($7 billion), three sources familiar with the matter said. 
Private equity companies Blackstone (N:BX), KKR (N:KKR), Carlyle, CVC, EQT and Partners Group are also expected to bid and might look for partners, according to the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private.
Nestle launched a review of the unit in September, as the maker of Nescafe coffee and Perrier water ditches underperforming businesses and fends off criticism from an activist investor who wants an overhaul.
The fragmented consumer health sector is attractive for deals because of aging populations in many industrialized nations, increased interest in health and rising incomes, analysts say.
Information memorandums on the skin health business sale, being run by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Evercore, are expected to be sent by the end of January and first-round bids are likely to be submitted in early March, the sources said.
Nestle and all the funds declined to comment.
Merz Pharma, a private German company that sells wrinkle fillers and other skin treatments, has reached out to several private equity bidders to find a partner, the sources said.
The move by Merz shows the strength of private equity in the auction, given they want the whole Nestle unit. Industry rivals are only expected to bid for parts of the business.
Nestle Skin Health, which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs last year, accounting for about 3 percent of Nestle's total.
The sources said industry players which might take part in the auction included  Beiersdorf  (DE:BEIG), Allergan (N:AGN), Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (N:JNJ), L'Oreal (PA:OREP),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR).
They all declined to comment as well. 
Sources previously estimated the unit could fetch 6 billion to 8 billion francs.
On Monday, one source put the range at 7.5 billion to 8.5 billion francs, based on 2018 operating earnings of 500 million to 550 million francs. Another source said the price tag could reach more than 9 billion francs if the unit was broken up. 
Nestle, the world's largest packaged food maker, created the Skin Health unit in 2014 when it bought out L'Oreal's stake in their Galderma joint venture.
Under CEO Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle's push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business. But the unit has performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turmoil on financial markets is expected to deepen layoffs and accelerate acquisitions in the fund management industry.
BlackRock (N:BLK), the world's largest money manager, and industry No. 3  State Street  (N:STT) announced job cuts this month after the worst year for many stock indexes since the financial crisis and losses across most other financial assets. Hedge funds AQR Capital and Balyasny Capital took similar steps.
""It will be a common industry trend,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with financial services firm Edward Jones.
""When markets go down, the first place asset managers look to cut costs is with headcount."" Until last year, rising markets – buoyed by easy money from central banks – had helped keep fund managers comfortably afloat, with many enjoying profit margins of 20-40 percent, even though fees have fallen.

But the prospect of tighter monetary policy and concerns around economic growth saw $168.1 billion drained from mutual funds globally in the final quarter of 2018, data from Lipper at Refinitiv showed.

GRAPHIC: Tough end to Q4 for many asset managers png - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HhH0Mq
Early January saw some money return to equity markets but it is too early to say if that will be sustained. In the meantime, without market performance to bolster their assets under management, investment managers' revenues, largely based on charging a fee on those assets, will suffer.
BlackRock reported a smaller-than-expected fourth quarter profit and analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 asset managers and custody banks to drop 0.8 percent on average. At the beginning of October, they had forecast growth of 10.3 percent, Refinitiv data show.
""With revenue-growth expectations dialed back, it's not surprising that firms like AQR and BlackRock are reprioritising,"" Neal Epstein, Vice President at Moody's Investors Service, said.
BlackRock, State Street and Balyasny Capital declined to comment. Claudia Gray, a spokeswoman for AQR Capital, said the company had experienced record growth in staffing over the past three years.
""Recent small reductions in headcount reflect the need to balance our workforce growth with the current needs of our business,” Gray said in a statement.
CONSOLIDATION DRIVE
If market volatility prompts more investors to pull their money it will compound existing pressure on asset managers from increased competition, particularly from cheaper index-tracking products that have driven down fees. Tougher regulations and investments in technology and data have also inflated costs with compliance managers and data specialists continuing to be hired.
Despite plans to cut 3 percent of its global workforce, BlackRock has said its staffing levels would be 4 percent higher this year as it invests in other areas, including technology.
Elsewhere, the cost-cutting pressure is particularly acute for smaller asset managers which lack the heft to compete on price against behemoths such as BlackRock, which has nearly $6 trillion in assets under management.
Smaller companies will have to go further to shore up their bottom line and, in addition to firing staff, may look to join forces with larger rivals to help share mid- and back-office costs, accelerating a trend begun over the last few years.
A 10 percent fall in assets under management could see profit margins slide by 700-1,000 basis points, which would ""absolutely drive consolidation"", UBS analyst Mike Werner said.
A total of 915 deals with a combined value of $50 billion were sealed last year, two thirds more valuable than in 2017, Refinitiv data showed, including Invesco's (N:IVZ) $5.7 billion acquisition of OppenheimerFunds.

GRAPHIC: Asset management M&A png - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RW2Adg
That trend is expected to accelerate, particularly in Europe, where listed asset managers’ share prices have been hit hard, and banks and insurers, which held onto their asset management arms during the financial crisis, may be more tempted to sell.
""As the value... is declining, potential sellers may be more inclined to close a deal, leading to increased consolidation,"" said Christian Edelmann, head of global banking and wealth & asset management at consultants Oliver Wyman.
Over 2018, the Thomson Reuters global fund managers index <.TRXFLDGLPUINVM> fell 27 percent with  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) down 40 percent, France's Amundi (PA:AMUN) down 35 percent and Italy's Anima (SA:ANIM3) down 39 percent.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Government credit ratings in the developing world face another turbulent year,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Credit ratings in the developing world look set to grind lower again this year as the world economy slows, with Latin America likely to be the center of the action -- though the news might not be all bad.
The year is already off to a gloomy start, with S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) warning last week that nearly a third of big bond issuers in emerging markets now have an unsustainable amount of debt.
Ratings matter for sovereign borrowers because the more highly rated they are, the lower their funding costs tend to be. 
Fitch Ratings thinks there will be more downgrades than upgrades again this year and Moody's Investors Service still has close to twice as many countries on downgrade warnings, at 19, than the 11 it sees as candidates for an upgrade. 
""Weaker emerging and frontier market countries face the greatest risks,"" Moody's said, while S&P flagged Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Lebanon, and Pakistan in its list of those with unsustainable debt piles.
Much of it comes down to a mix of over-borrowing, trade tensions and a reliance by some countries on selling oil or other commodities whose prices have been volatile, but there are some notable idiosyncrasies now worth watching.
Fitch's top sovereign analyst, James McCormack, has analyzed what happens to countries' ratings when their currencies drop sharply, as many did in emerging markets last year. 
He found that if the currency drops 30 percent for at least a year, the sovereign rating falls an average of two notches. More concerning, though, is that of 16 such cases seen over the last 18 years, six have ended in a default.
That could spell bad news for Turkey, which was downgraded once -- by Fitch -- last year, but even more so for B- rated Argentina, whose currency more than halved in value in 2018. It is already on that default list twice, in 2002 and 2014.
""I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more downward pressure (on global ratings) because we think the risks are really skewed to the downside,"" McCormack told Reuters. 
GRAPHICS: When currencies plunge ratings fall - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hk3QTJ
Two other South American countries will also be watched closely. First is Brazil which has lost investment-grade ratings from all three big ratings firms as its troubles have mounted in recent years.
Last year's election of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and hopes he will drive through key economic changes have brought renewed optimism and propelled the real  into the top four best-performing world currencies this year.
A model calculated by one of S&P's divisions using data such as credit default swap prices, which can be a leading indicator for ratings moves, suggests good news for the rating too. 
It shows financial markets currently pricing Brazil as if its credit rating was two notches higher than its actual BB-level. That would leave it just one further upgrade short of regaining investment-grade status. 
GRAPHICS: Things looking up again for Brazil rating - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SY0FCj
CAIDO ANGEL?
Uruguay is another South American country that could be in the spotlight. 
Fitch's McCormack flagged it as a potential ""fallen angel"" -- rating agency parlance for a country that drops from the investment-grade category into sub-investment-grade, or 'junk'.
Such a shift often forces larger pension and investment funds that focus on high-grade assets to sell the country's bonds, which in turn drives up its borrowing costs and causes more pain.
Fitch has Uruguay on the lowest rung of the investment-grade ladder, at BBB- with a negative outlook. S&P and Moody's still rate it higher, but studies from the likes of the European Central Bank have shown the first cut always causes the pain. 
Asked if a downgrade for Uruguay was likely, McCormack said there was a good chance especially as the country had seen a big rise in debt since securing its investment-grade rating. 
""We do have it on a negative outlook,"" he noted.
Moving in the opposite direction, meanwhile, could be Croatia. Both Fitch and S&P have it on watch for an upgrade, although as Moody's already assigns an investment-grade rating, most of the benefit may well have been seen.
Among the emerging markets heavyweights, China could come under pressure if it goes on a stimulus splurge to offset the effects of its trade war with the United States. 
Ratings agencies have also warned that new U.S. sanctions could spoil Russia's positive rating story, although as it still has one of the world's lowest debt levels, a downgrade may not hurt too much.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) sees a potential export market of more than $20 billion for its F-16 fighter aircraft from an assembly line in India it has offered to set up in order to win a large Indian military order, a top executive said.
The U.S. defense firm is competing with Boeing's (N:BA) F/A-18, Saab's (ST:SAABb) Gripen, Dassault Aviation's (PA:AVMD) Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and a Russian aircraft to supply the Indian air force with 114 combat planes in a deal estimated to be worth more than $15 billion. 
Lockheed Martin has offered to shift its F-16 production line from the United States to India, potentially the biggest boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make-in-India project to create a defense industrial base and generate jobs for the thousands of youth entering the workforce each month. 
Vivek Lall, the vice president of strategy and business development at Lockheed, told Reuters that the firm would make India the sole global production center for the F-16 that would meet the requirements for the Indian military but also overseas markets.
""We see current demand outside of India of more than 200 aircraft. The value of those initial acquisition programs would likely exceed $20 billion,"" Lall said.
Bahrain and Slovakia had picked the F-16 Block 70 that had been offered to India, he said. ""We are in discussions with Bulgaria, several other countries, 10 countries. There is a kind of a renaissance of the F-16.""
India's defense ministry is expected to issue an expression of interest over the next several months, followed by a request for proposals in a long, drawn out process for the air force contract.
India’s military has said it wants 42 squadrons of jets, around 750 aircraft, to defend against a two pronged attack from China and Pakistan. But with old Russian jets like the MiG-21, first used in the 1960s, retiring soon, it could end up with only 22 squadrons by 2032, officials have warned. 
Lall said the plan to relocate the F-16 plant which was originally in Fort Worth, Texas, will not undermine U.S. President Donald Trump's signature goal of moving manufacturing back to America. 
The plant in Texas is being used to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. 
Lall said there would still be work done out of the United States even if production of the F-16 moves to India and that Make in India and Trump's Make America Great Again were not at cross purposes. 
""I think they complementary. The U.S. has a certain amount engineering and strength that will continue as long as the product is there, that will continue even when production moves.""

Lockheed has picked Tata Advanced Systems as its Indian partner for the proposed F-16 plant and last year it announced that their joint venture will produce wings for the aircraft in India, regardless of whether it wins the Indian military order.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei has launched an unprecedented public relations blitz, thrusting its low-key founder in front of international media as the telecoms firm seeks to ease concern among Western nations bent on shutting it out of their markets.
The move, along with significant personnel change in its 300-strong corporate affairs department, comes as the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker battles fear of Chinese authorities accessing its infrastructure for espionage.
In a 25-minute interview aired late on Sunday - his first with state-controlled China Central Television (CCTV) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei shrugged off the global push against his company, which has repeatedly denied any state links.
""If you do (your product) well, there is no need to worry about sales... It would be stupid on their part if they don't buy,"" the 74-year-old said in a one-on-one, adding to three group interviews last week with English, Chinese and Japanese media outlets.
""It would be their loss,"" Ren said, referring to the United States and other Western countries which have restricted Huawei in their markets.
Before last week, Ren had had no more than 10 interviews across media since founding Huawei in 1987, CCTV said. He last met international media at Davos in 2015.
""My public relations department forced me,"" a smiling Ren told CCTV when asked why he had opened up to the media. ""I must make our clients understand us, make our 180,000 employees understand us, come together and get through this tough time."" 
PERSONAL ATTACK
The comments come as Polish authorities earlier this month arrested a Huawei executive on spying allegations, fuelling Western suspicion against Huawei on national security grounds.
While the Chinese national who was immediately sacked by Huawei denied the allegations, Huawei is bracing for potential fallout from its biggest Western markets as Germany debates whether to follow the United States and allies such as Australia in restricting Huawei's market access.
The firm has been shut out of Australia and New Zealand's markets for fifth-generation (5G) mobile telecoms equipment, while the U.S. President Donald Trump is considering an outright ban on all Huawei equipment with an executive order. 
Huawei is nevertheless seeing fast growth, securing 30 contracts to supply 5G equipment and shipping 25,000 5G base stations already - up from 25 contracts in December, Ren told CCTV.
A person close to Ren told Reuters that the CEO felt the need to talk to the media after the string of negative events overshadowed the company's business over the past year. 
Among the most high-profile events was the arrest in Canada of Ren's daughter - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wenzhou - over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
""With all the attacks over the past year, now it got personal - when your daughter gets arrested,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified.
The arrest was made at the request of the United States, and further strained Sino-U.S. at a time when trade friction was already threatening to undermine ties.
Still, with his daughter released on bail and awaiting a U.S. extradition request, Ren, in an interview with international media last week, described Trump as a ""great president"".

Ren's media engagement is part of a broader public relations offensive by a firm whose traditional opaqueness results from being in a highly competitive sector and having significant R&D programs, ""perhaps lending credence to misperceptions we are too secretive"", said Chen Lifang, president of public affairs.
""Huawei is very concerned about misunderstandings which continue to linger despite our best efforts in recent years,"" Chen told Reuters in a statement. ""Huawei is committed to being even more open and transparent for not only this year but the foreseeable future.""
The firm has expanded its international communications team by 25 percent to 30 people over the past six months as it steps up engagement with foreign media, including tours to research labs that had not previously been open to outsiders.
Among major personnel changes, Huawei's president of global media and communications, Joy Tan, has moved to Washington to run media and government relations operations there, while Song Kai, former deputy CEO of Huawei U.S. and former CEO of Huawei France, has moved back to headquarters to take over Tan's role.
Huawei's Washington office has more than halved in size over the past year to low single-digit regular staff members, with some employees voluntarily leaving the firm as it was pushed out of the market, people familiar with the matter said.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs had left the company as scrutiny of the firm deepened.
Some Huawei employees described the rapid turn in the international environment as beyond their imagination.
""The AT&T deal at the start of the year was like the party about to start,"" a member of Huawei's public relations team told Reuters, referring to a partnership with U.S. company AT&T Inc (N:T).

""And then suddenly the house caught fire, the party became firefighting, and then the fire spread to more and more places... Now we decided we've just had enough. It's time to be proactive and open ourselves up to the world.""

325,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Cummins CMI,"Cummins (NYSE:CMI) designs, manufactures, and distributes engines and related components for use in heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks, buses, construction and mining equipment, and standby power generation, explains Doug Gerlach, editor of Investor Advisory Service.
Over nearly a century, the company has earned a reputation as a leading engine manufacturer, known for the reliability and superior quality of its products. Cummins has been a beneficiary of coordinated global growth and a strong truck market. Just over half of the company’s sales come from the U.S.
Over the past decade Cummins has benefitted from rising fuel-efficiency standards and emissions reduction regulations, which have served as a tailwind.
As a cyclical company, Cummins is dependent upon economic growth for near-term results, though the company has definite long-term growth characteristics. Given the recent strength, there is some question as to where we are in the important North American heavy-duty truck cycle.
These concerns are mitigated in part by the current backlog, which is the highest in 20 years and gives good visibility through 2019. Furthermore, management emphasizes that demand continues to be strong and broad-based globally across most of its on-highway and off-highway markets.
Warranty issues have been a nagging problem for the company, and management has worked to address these. In the second quarter, the company took a $181 million charge to address the performance of a faulty emissions control system in certain on-highway engines produced between 2010 and 2015.
Management targets warranty costs of 2% of sales over the longer term versus the 3.1% it reported in 2017 and 2.4% guidance for 2018. The increased focus on quality appears to be reflected in the performance of more recently launched engines.
Material costs and tariffs are also a concern and a key reason why the stock is down approximately 25% from highs reached earlier this year. Cummins recently highlighted an expectation of approximately a $200 million annual headwind, split 50%-50% between materials costs and tariffs.
The company reiterated its full year guidance for sales growth of 15%-17%. Management also reduced its expectation for tariff-related expenses for this year to $80 million, down from a previous estimate of $100 million.
For 2019, the company now expects tariff-related costs of $250 million, which is $50 million higher than previous projections. Cummins expects to offset the majority of the tariff costs through pricing and improvements in its supply chain.
Accounting for the cyclicality of the business, we look to more muted growth over the next five years, targeting 7% sales growth and 10% EPS growth. Five years of 10% growth could result in EPS as high as $22.00.
The cyclical nature of the business makes it necessary to adjust historical P/E ratios. We estimate an appropriate high P/E to be 15.0x, which suggests a potential high price of $330 and a possible annual total return of 23.2% from the recent price of $130.

326,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- General Electric GE,"Many of the world’s finest companies are trading at prices that we have not seen for several years. I urge investors to take advantage of these opportunities while they last, suggests Jim Powell, editor of Global Changes & Opportunities Report.
For investors who are willing to accept higher risk, my top pick for aggressive investors for 2019 is  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). This is one of the worst-performing blue-chip stocks that we have seen in many years.
From a $31.60 high in November 2017, the stock is now selling for just $7.26 — a stomach-churning 77.0% plunge. Most of the slide was due to a series of poor business choices by the company’s former management. The stock market correction took GE down even further.
It is possible that GE will go lower. If so, I doubt that any additional decline will be very large. On the contrary, I believe the odds favor a turnaround for this 126-year-old company that has been shutting down or selling underperforming operations, showing poor managers the door, and refocusing its efforts on businesses where it remains competitive.
The most encouraging development at GE is its new CEO, Lawrence Culp, is dragging the company back from the mistakes of his predecessors. The turnaround will not happen quickly and probably not smoothly.
However, I feel strongly that long-term investors who take positions in GE at today’s low price will be very happy they did. It won’t be the first time that this 126-year old company stumbled badly, and was pronounced dead by Wall Street analysts, and then recovered.
In closing, I will say once again that the very best use of a stock market correction is to buy blue chips that are selling at bargain prices. That’s even more true when taking a position in a company like General Electric that was stumbling before the correction pushed its price even lower.

327,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Roku ROKU,"Looking at the Nasdaq wreckage, the question isn’t which mid-cap tech stock is growing faster than its current valuation implies but which one has the most room to rebound. We’re going with Roku (ROKU), which we view as the gatekeeper to the streaming resolution, suggests John Freund, contributing editor to Todd Shaver's Bull Market Report.
We believe that the company’s ongoing shift from hardware to services will turn the stock around. The Roku devices have evolved give consumers a low-cost entry into one of the fastest-growing advertising ecosystems around, effectively replacing commercial television for the “cord cutting” audience.
Start with the operating system, which is being packaged on more and more smart TVs from third-party manufacturers. Since 2014, the company has gone from a standing start to seeing its technology incorporated into 25% of all smart TVs now on the market. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can’t fight that. Nobody else can even try.
Notice that Roku-enabled TVs naturally replace sales of the Roku device. That’s part of the overall strategy. After all, devices come and go, but once your technology is embedded in the screen itself, your commercial presence is literally hardwired into the living room.
As management notes, 10% of all U.S. households no longer subscribe to even basic cable television service even though those households still have an average of three TVs apiece. Replacing the traditional cable box and getting onto future generations of the TV itself is the future.
Millennials are now the biggest demographic group. Many are unreachable to conventional advertisers — except via the Roku interface, which streams the company’s authorized messaging to the screen.
With $70 billion in TV advertising at stake, Roku can grow its share of the overall media universe as fast as it can sell devices to households who’ve already cut the cable “cord” and now need to find a way to push new shows to their living room screens.
Watch the platform revenue numbers Roku reports. That’s advertising, embedded software and content fees, and it’s already close to 60% of the business, ramping up 75% a year. Gross margin on that side is above 70%, as close to pure profit as it gets even in Silicon Valley. The company could practically stop selling the Roku device altogether and it would barely make a dent in the bottom line.
Purely based on the platform business, we expect Roku to be sustainably profitably within the next year, assuming of course that no Silicon Valley giant hungry for a deeper streaming video presence takes it out at a rich acquisition price. Of course a lot can happen in a year, but if the company gets to that stage shareholders can write their own long-term ticket. This can easily be an $80 stock.

328,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Children's Place PLCE,"With headline growth shifting out of “neutral,"" Children’s Place (PLCE) — a conservative, value-oriented idea for 2019 — is extremely attractive here at a 43% discount from its 52-week high, observes growth stock specialist Hilary Kramer, editor of GameChangers.
The negative growth story is overdone: the clothing retailing chain isn’t faltering so much as shifting the merchandise mix down market to capture share from bankrupt rival Gymboree.
Exploiting that opportunity requires sacrificing 1% of margin in the immediate term but I still see revenue ramping 4%-5% a year to balance the trend. I expect year-over-year earnings growth to recover before 2Q19. After that, consensus looks a little low once those shoppers are lured away.
We’re looking at 12X forward earnings as it is, so it doesn’t take a lot of added sales or margin reflation to make that proposition a classic buy.
I’m looking at the online operation to feed that growth. After all, children’s apparel is a tricky business to move online because shoppers want to see the clothes and in many cases have the kids try them on.
Bringing an online component into the brick-and-mortar retail presence makes a lot more sense. At that point, it’s less about diverting market share from other outlets and more about smart inventory management that ensures that every shopper gets access to every piece of merchandise — in the physical cart if possible, delivered if not.
In the near term, the should at least test $130 once the market mood recovers. The yield isn’t huge (2%) but it’s enough to keep shareholders motivated for even better things ahead.
And it can definitely do great things once management proves the new business model. When a competitor fumbles, smart players invest resources to score points. That’s what’s happening now and it’s why I see PLCE continuing its track record for delivering strong returns on assets.

329,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- At Home HOME,"At Home (HOME) is a home décor superstore which offers 50,000 on-trend home products to fit any budget or style; there are 168 stores open and they expect to open 31 stores in all this year, explains Tom Bishop, small cap specialist and editor of BI Research.
At Home hit an air pocket in the wake of the release of Q3 earnings (on December 6th). The company posted a 25% increase in revenues to $267 million beating the consensus by a couple million and adjusted EPS of $0.18 was up 157%, also beating expectations by $0.03. However, management also gave some cautionary notes on some headwinds in Q4.
However, an upside EPS surprise of $0.03 vs. the consensus allowed it to continue to guide to its earlier $1.28-$1.31 for the full year (FY1/19). I should note here that management tends to guide conservatively, having beaten estimates by 20%, 3%, 15% and 43% in the past 4 quarters.
While the company deferred on giving guidance on the year ahead (FY1/20) until its year end conference call in March, it did note that the new Pennsylvania distribution center (its second in Washington, DC) would weigh on Q4 due to $4 million of one-time start-up expenses.
While some investors took this all in and hit the exit button — tanking the stock to $20 in two days — on 12/10, two directors bellied up to the deep discount table and scarfed down 20,400 shares between them at around $21. And one of them also purchased 10,000 shares at $26.50 in late October.
On 12/10 the CFO also bought 4,993 shares at $20.28, and on 12/11 the CEO exercised an option to buy 20,000 shares at $9.73 and did notturn right around a sell them (as is often the case). And on 12/13 another director bought 22,500 shares at $21.13 ($475k). And then one more insider stepped up to the plate on 12/26 and helped himself to 3,875 shares at $17.20.
Whether all the pain has been lashed out, I can’t say. But all this insider buying is certainly encouraging. So on the basis of HOME’s deep discount and the huge insider buying, the shares are a buy for longer term aggressive investors.

330,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Illinois Tool Works ITW,"Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) manufactures and sells industrial products and equipment worldwide; the stock is my top pick for investors seeking a safe investment idea, explains Jimmy Mengel, editor of The Crow's Nest.
Illinois Tool Works operates through seven segments:
• Automotive OEM
• Food equipment
• Test and measurement and electronics
• Welding
• Polymers and fluids
• Construction products
• Specialty products
The company was founded in 1912 by Byron L. Smith. He put out an ad in the Economist, looking to provide capital to a “high class business (manufacturing preferred) in or near Chicago.” He turned down several initial offers, waiting for the right proposal. And when a group of inventors with an idea to improve gear grinding came along, ITW was born.
It’s now one of the best-performing dividend stocks of the last century. It’s flourished through wars and recessions and has expanded its businesses around the world.
The company is not only a dividend aristocrat; it’s also a dividend king. This means that it’s had over 50 years of consecutive dividend increases. Here are some more details on this dividend king:
• In 2011, Illinois Tool Works had more than 20,000 unexpired patents and pending patent applications worldwide, including 2,900 U.S. patents and 1,116 pending U.S. applications. The company typically ranks in the top 100 of patent issuers in the U.S.
• The company ranked 414 on the Forbes Global 2,000.
• It sports a solid dividend of 2% and a five-year dividend growth rate of 15.5%.
If you invested $10,000 in 1998 and reinvestment the dividends, you'd be looking at around $58,000 today.
The company lost around 20% over the last year, which makes for an attractive long-term dividend position heading into the new year.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>","Global FDI skids 19 percent on Trump tax reform, may rebound in 2019 - U.N.","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment (FDI) fell 19 percent last year to an estimated $1.2 trillion, largely caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tax reforms, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Monday. 
FDI, comprising cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A), intra-company loans and investment in start-up projects abroad, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties.
But it can also go into reverse as companies pull investments out of foreign projects or repatriate earnings.
The lowest net global FDI since 2009 was the result of U.S. firms repatriating $300 billion or more in accumulated earnings to take advantage of Trump's tax break.
Net investment flows into Europe slumped by an unprecedented 73 percent to $100 billion, a level not seen since the 1990s, as U.S. firms pulled years of profits out of affiliates in Ireland, Switzerland and elsewhere.
UNCTAD investment chief James Zhan told reporters that U.S. repatriation of profits had slowed down and an FDI rebound was possible this year, but there were also growing risks.
""It's what we call the potential trade-investment-technology war that will affect global investment, and we see that the rising protectionist measures of a number of countries and the prospects for global economic growth are worsening,"" Zhan said.
The United States remained the top destination for FDI in 2018, attracting $226 billion, 18 percent less than in 2017.
Second was China, up 3 percent to $142 billion, and third was Britain, which saw a 20 percent jump to $122 billion, mainly due to a doubling of reinvested earnings and a tripling in the value of M&A deals.
""Despite the huge uncertainty related to the Brexit, the UK government has intensified its effort to promote and facilitate new investment, as well as to retain existing investment in the country, including formulating a strategy and adopting new measures for attracting foreign investment,"" Zhan told Reuters.
Notable megadeals included Comcast's (O:CMCSA) $40 billion acquisition of Sky, Vantif's $10 billion purchase of Worldpay, and the acquisition of Unilever’s margarine & spreads business for $8 billion by KKR & Co.
One major growth area in 2018 was the value of newly announced ""greenfield"" investments into developing countries in Asia, which rose 84 percent to $390 billion.

Zhan said the rise was largely due to firms restructuring supply chains in Southeast Asia, driven by a desire to avoid getting caught up in trade tensions, as well as by new opportunities from the 11-country Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and investment liberalization in China.

May will make a statement in the House of Commons at about 15:30 GMT (10:30 AM ET) as she looks to secure a fresh withdrawal agreement before the March 29 deadline to leave the European Union (EU). Her Brexit divorce deal, the result of nearly two years of negotiations with the EU, was voted down by 432 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament last week. Her efforts to win over opposition lawmakers with modest concessions went nowhere at the weekend.
""May's latest statement on her Brexit intentions is likely to suggest that her Plan B is simply to carry on with her Plan A,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. He said discussions would be held in the hope of avoiding ""the major economic self-harm of a no deal.""
With just over two months left until the U.K. is due to leave the EU, there is no agreement in London on how it should leave the world's biggest trading bloc. The FTSE 350 Banks Index was down around 0.3% in London by 11:40 GMT (6:40AM ET).
 Metro Bank  PLC (LON:MTRO) led losses, with shares down 1.7%.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) were also lower, with shares each dropping about 0.8%, while  HSBC Holdings  PLC (LON:HSBA) dipped 0.3%.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) saw shares outperform however, rising 0.4%. Standard Chartered is more exposed to Asian economies, and rose on hopes of more stimulus from Beijing after data showing that China's economic growth slowed to a 28-year low in 2018.

334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Canadian Oil Surge Fails to Lift Producers Out of the Doldrums,"(Bloomberg) -- Alberta’s crude curtailment plan has caused a dramatic rise in the price of heavy Canadian oil. But for shares of energy companies, it hasn’t been as much of a help.
Since the production curtailment was unveiled early last month, Western Canadian Select crude has almost doubled to about $43 a barrel, narrowing its discount to benchmark U.S. oil to an almost decade-low of $6.95 a barrel on Jan. 11. Yet in that same time, the S&P/TSX Energy Index is up less than 4 percent.
Driving the stagnant performance are the forced cuts in output among the larger producers as well as a series of conservative moves by smaller drillers who are less affected by the program. Overall, the industry is dialing back spending and waiting for better days -- a strategy that analysts have lauded as prudent but that investors have found less than compelling.
“Certainly the curtailment program has helped the cash flows, but it’s sending a clear signal: ‘You can’t grow. Don’t even try,’” said Laura Lau, who helps manage C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto.
The larger producers that are most affected by the curtailment, such as  Suncor Energy  Inc (TO:SU).,  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd . (NYSE:CNQ) and  Cenovus Energy  Inc. (TO:CVE), are all planning on flat or reduced spending next year.
Smaller drillers who aren’t forced to cut as much output are following suit.  Whitecap Resources Inc . (TO:WCP) said last month that it’s keeping spending in line with last year’s levels and heavily weighting it to the second half.  Crescent Point Energy Corp . (TO:CPG) said last week that it’s slashing its spending by C$500 million to about C$1.3 billion and trimming its dividend.
The frugality has even spread beyond the oil industry to gas producers, much of whose output goes to fuel oil-sands operations. Peyto Exploration & Development Corp. last week set a capital budget of C$150 million to C$200 million for the year, down C$100 million from the forecast it gave in November, and cut its dividend.
While many of those moves were cheered by analysts, investors were less enthused. In the first trading session after announcing their plans, Peyto slid 11 percent, Crescent Point fell 1.3 percent and Whitecap dropped 6.8 percent.
The message that companies are sending to investors is that they don’t have confidence that the long-term problems the industry is facing -- such as the inability to get new pipelines built -- will be fixed, Lau said. And even though the curtailment program is achieving its goal of boosting Canadian crude prices, the fact that it was even needed sends a negative signal to investors, she said.
“If Alberta, which I’d argue is the most entrepreneurial of the provinces, is seeking government intervention, it just shows things are really bad,” Lau said.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Nissan's Ghosn offers to wear electronic ankle tag for bail,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Motor Co Chairman Carlos Ghosn has offered to wear an electronic ankle tag and hire guards to monitor him in an unusual bid to secure his release on bail after two months of detention in Japan for alleged financial crimes.
Ghosn is also willing to remain in Tokyo, where he has leased an apartment, and post stock he owns in Nissan as collateral, his spokeswoman said. A new bail hearing is set for Monday after an earlier request was denied due partly to concerns the French executive was a flight risk.
His release would allow Ghosn to meet more frequently with his lawyers and defend himself before the board of  Renault , where he remains chairman and CEO, amid calls for his removal and potential moves to restructure the Nissan tie-up.
As his arrest on Nov. 19 continued to cloud the outlook for Nissan's three-way alliance with France's Renault SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Nissan said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' capital ties.
Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm.
""We are not at the stage for such discussions,"" Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Monday.
Saikawa also said he had not heard directly about a reported French proposal to integrate the Japanese carmaker's management with Renault, adding that it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' capital ties.
The Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday that a French government delegation had informed Tokyo that it would seek an integration of Renault and Nissan, most likely under the umbrella of a single holding company.
""Since I have not heard this directly, I cannot comment,"" Saikawa told reporters.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK quoted French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire as telling journalists that an integration proposal was ""not on the table now"". 
A source familiar with Nissan's thinking said the reported French proposal did not ""make sense"" given the two companies' different cultures, Renault's lower productivity and Nissan's bigger contribution of key technology.
""It's a virtual merger, I don't think it makes sense,"" the source said, adding he had not heard directly of such a French proposal.
BAIL DECISION
Ghosn denies any wrongdoing as he awaits trial on charges of financial misconduct.
""I will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,"" Ghosn said in a statement on Sunday.
""I am not guilty of the charges against me and I look forward to defending my reputation in the courtroom."" 
Renault, which dominates the partnership through its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is expected to meet within days to consider potential candidates to replace Ghosn as chief executive officer and chairman.
The co-chair of a committee set up by Nissan to examine the root cause of Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct and propose corporate governance reforms said on Sunday he believed Ghosn may have had questionable ethical standards. 
""Having read the report on the internal investigation, my initial impression was that the head of the company may have had questionable ethical standards,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing late on Sunday after the panel held its first meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Monday from six-week highs after China's fourth-quarter growth figures confirmed a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy with 2018 its weakest year since 1990.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent by 0930 GMT and Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) dropped 0.5 percent while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) held flat thanks to strong oil stocks.
Investors were poised for earnings to begin flowing in, with Henkel and  Wienerberger  among those reporting on Monday, and some said they expected stocks to react positively overall as sharp recent selloffs had sunk valuations. 
""I am not too pessimistic,"" said Christian Stocker, lead equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. ""We saw very negative earnings revisions in Q4 and now the expectations are very, very low.""
Stocker expects fourth-quarter earnings to grow 5 percent year-on-year, and sees potential in the first quarter for the EuroSTOXX 50 to rise to around 3,250 points, for the DAX around 11,500 and for the FTSE MIB to 20,200.
""As long as we have low but positive earnings growth I think we have a solid basis for the equity market,"" he added. 
With U.S. markets closed for Martin Luther King Day, trading was likely to stay thin, but company news kept investors busy.
German chemicals firm Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), maker of Persil detergent and Schwarzkopf shampoo, was the biggest STOXX 600 faller, down 5 percent after announcing increased investments in new brands, marketing and digitalization.
Shares in online classifieds firm Scout24 (DE:G24n) climbed 3.1 percent after it rejected a 4.7 billion euro ($5.4 billion)takeover offer from private equity firms Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone (NYSE:BX), potentially paving the way for a bidding war.
""We think Scout was right to reject the offer,"" Liberum analysts said, adding that the bid valued the firm at just more than 14 times adjusted EBITDA, below the 19 times Silver Lake paid for ZPG last year. 
""We would expect other bidders to now emerge for the asset,"" Liberum said.
The world's largest brickmaker, Wienerberger (VI:WBSV), edged down 0.4 percent after the firm raised its dividend, saying it would reach the upper end of its 2018 earnings guidance thanks to acquisitions and cost savings.
""With Wienerberger having already raised guidance in its Capital Markets Day [...] we believe these results were already expected by the market,"" wrote UBS analysts. 
Elsewhere, broker notes moved some stocks: Air France (PA:AIRF) shares rose 4.2 percent after Davy Research upgraded the airline to outperform, while  Fraport  (DE:FRAG) gained 3.1 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised it to neutral from sell.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) fell 2.4 percent after Berenberg cut the stock to a ""sell"", and  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) fell 2.4 percent after Citi cut it to ""neutral"" from ""buy"".

338,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 04:37AM ET</span>","China data met with relief by stock markets, Brexit Plan B in focus","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets kept their nerve on Monday, as data showed the Chinese economy slowed last year, underlining the need for more stimulus from Beijing. 
European stock markets opened broadly lower (STOXX) as a note of caution set in with British Prime Minister Theresa May set to present her 'Plan B' for Brexit to parliament later in the day. Trade in general was subdued with U.S. markets closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
World markets appeared to experience some relief thanks to data showing that the Chinese economy, the world's second biggest, grew 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis.
But the data was in line with forecasts and there were some bright spots, with factory output picking up stronger-than-expected in December and a stronger services sector.
""On balance, the data is relatively positive and does not point to a hard landing,"" said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in London.
""The consumption data being better than expected is the positive takeaway in that China is trying to engineer a move towards a consumer-led economy."" 
Growing signs of weakness in China -- which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years -- has fueled anxiety about risks to the world economy in recent weeks and are weighing on profits for firms such as Apple (O:AAPL).
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.2 percent, touching its highest since early December. Stock markets in China (CSI300) and Japan (N225) added 0.25-0.6 percent.
MSCI's emerging market stock index (MSCIEF) briefly touched its highest level since October, while the Australian dollar , often used a liquid proxy for China investments, nudged up to $0.7185.
Chinese stocks had rallied on Friday on reports U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, a story later denied.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there has been progress toward a trade deal with China, but denied that he was considering lifting tariffs.
PLAN B
In currency markets, the British pound pulled further away from last week's two-month highs against the euro as investors awaited the next steps to break the deadlock over Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected by lawmakers last week and May will return to parliament on Monday to outline her so-called Plan B. 
""May's latest statement on her Brexit intentions is likely to suggest that her Plan B is simply to carry on with her Plan A,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. He said discussions would be held in the hope of avoiding ""the major economic self-harm of a no deal.""
The uncertainty kept sterling pressured at $1.2852 , having briefly been as high as $1.3000 last week.
Against the euro, the pound slipped a quarter of a percent to 88.46 pence (EURGBP=D3). 
Weakness in sterling helped lift London's blue-chip stock index (FTSE), while stock markets in Paris and Frankfurt weakened 0.2-0.4 percent (GDAXI) (FCHI). 
The dollar softened against the yen at 109.58 , and was about a fifth of a percent weaker versus the euro (EUR=). Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was a shade softer at 96.229. (DXY).
Elsewhere, crude prices briefly rose to their highest so far in 2019 after data showed refinery processing in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, climbed to a record last year despite a slowing economy. [O/R]
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) briefly rose above $63 for the first time in 2019. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were steady at $53.78 a barrel, having earlier pushed above $54 a barrel for the first time this year.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 03:19AM ET</span>",GSK Chairman Hampton to step down ahead of split,"By Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) Chairman Philip Hampton will step down after more than three and a half years in the role, as Britain's biggest drugmaker prepares to split its business into two.
The announcement comes a month after GSK's Chief Executive Emma Walmsley announced her boldest plans yet - to split the company into two businesses -- one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products.
Walmsley, who took the helm in 2017, announced in December that GSK and  Pfizer  (N:PFE) would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 percent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction.
""Following the announcement of our deal with Pfizer and the intended separation of the new consumer business, I believe this is the right moment to step down and allow a new Chair to oversee this process through to its conclusion over the next few years,"" Hampton said in a statement.
Hampton, aged 65, was paid a sum of 700,000 pounds ($900,550), of which he elected to take 25 percent in GSK shares, according to the company's 2017 annual report.
He took the top job at GSK at a testing time - just after a profit warning in 2014 due to weak sales of its core respiratory drugs. 
The Briton was tasked with helping steer the drugmaker back to sustainable growth. Shares of GSK have, however, remained flat after peaking about 17 percent during his tenure.
They were little changed in early trading on Monday. 
GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rivals under previous CEO Andrew Witty. 
Seeking to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019.
Before joining GSK, Hampton was chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) and J  Sainsbury  plc (L:SBRY). 
He was parachuted in to help rescue RBS following its 45 billion pounds bailout during the financial crisis and led the bank through a turbulent period of transition.

GSK, which has been looking to buy early-stage assets and partner with companies, said it had started the search for a successor.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>","Sainsbury's-Asda tie-up not a done deal yet, experts warn","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Shortly after last year's announcement of a $9.4 billion deal to combine the Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) supermarket group that he runs with rival Asda, boss Mike Coupe was caught on camera singing ""We're in the money"".
Not so fast, some competition lawyers, analysts and rivals warn, ahead of a provisional regulatory ruling due in the coming weeks on a deal that could create Britain's largest retailer, with annual sales of about 51 billion pounds ($66 billion).
Recent decisions by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) suggest it won't shy away from intervention, they say, and some conditions it could apply may prove too costly to make a deal worthwhile.
Coupe and Roger Burnley, chief executive of Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda, have said they do not expect the CMA to make the deal unpalatable. The regulator is due to publish its final report in early March, although it could be delayed until the end of April.
Sainsbury's and Asda say they will lower prices on ""everyday items"" by around 10 percent, financed by cost savings from big multi-national suppliers.
Others have doubts.
""Other than Sainsbury's and Asda, it is hard to think of anyone involved in the industry that is publicly stating this takeover is not against the public interest,"" said HSBC analyst David McCarthy.
He believes the CMA will not pass the deal without substantial conditions, and that it could even be blocked in its entirety.
Failure to secure the takeover would deal a major blow to Sainsbury's efforts to prosper in the face of growing competition from discounters and online players, and would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart.
The key factor in the decision is whether the CMA, led by former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie since last June, rules the retailers must sell some of their combined 2,800 stores to protect competition in areas where they overlap.
Both companies have declined to say how many forced store disposals would make the deal unattractive.
But a source with knowledge of the two firms' thinking told Reuters a figure ""into the hundreds"" could scupper it.
Even if a deal is cleared, finding buyers for large stores in an industry increasingly moving online and to smaller convenience shops will not be easy.
Rivals and suppliers have made a raft of submissions to the regulator opposing the deal.
Some analysts also drew negative inference from Sainsbury's and Asda's pre-Christmas clash with the CMA over its refusal to give them more time to respond to evidence, a row that went to court.
And some of the CMA's recent dealings have pointed to more intervention following a period where the perception was of a more hands-off approach.
That perception was underscored by its unconditional clearance of Tesco's (L:TSCO) takeover of wholesaler Booker in 2017, a decision that confounded most expectations.
But last year, the CMA indicated it may block credit data company Experian's takeover of rival ClearScore, and took PayPal's $2.2 billion takeover of Swedish financial tech firm iZettle to an extended probe.
""There's a real sense with Tyrie's arrival the CMA want to prove that they've got teeth,"" said one competition lawyer, who declined to be named. ""They can block it by asking for a disproportionately large number of stores being divested.""
The CMA declined to comment.
    
THE ALDI FACTOR
Since Coupe became CEO in 2014, Sainsbury's has reported just one year of profit growth. 
Subject to required store disposals, the combined group would become Britain's biggest retailer, leapfrogging  Tesco  with a market share of more than 31 percent and a workforce of 330,000. Tesco has 27.8 percent, Sainsbury's 16.2 percent, Asda 15.2 percent and Morrisons 10.6 percent, according to data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel.
German-owned discount groups Aldi and Lidl, with a total UK grocery market share of 12.8 percent, will be included in the CMA's assessment.
If the regulator considers them powerful enough to prevent the merged group from hiking prices, that would work in favor of the acquisition.
But the CMA must decide whether Aldi or Lidl stores provide the same competition as Tesco or Morrisons stores do.
""If the discounters are excluded (not considered mainstream competitors) then Sainsbury's and Asda have got a real difficulty,"" said a senior UK grocery industry executive, who asked not to be named.
Sainsbury's and Asda argue the discounters have an influence on how supermarkets of any size trade.
""For Aldi not to be a consideration in the market would be insane on the basis they've got a bigger own-brand business than we do,"" said one Sainsbury's insider.
While discounters have won market share from the big four grocers, they differ by operating smaller stores and selling a limited range of products versus the big four, for example.
METHODOLOGY IS KEY
The CMA's initial investigation identified 463 local areas where Sainsbury's and Asda stores overlap, which, it said, threatened higher prices or a worse quality of service.
Coupe and Burnley are banking on the regulator using a more sophisticated way of looking at the market in the latter part of the probe.
That methodology, used in the investigation into Tesco's bid for Booker, would take into account the impact of a broader range of competitors, including discounters. The CMA also decides the inputs to the methodology.
""If you want to be interventionist there's plenty of scope to do so in devising both your formula but also in some of the assumptions you feed into it,"" said the competition lawyer.
The pledge to cut prices could also be problematic, if the regulator suspects they would come from smaller suppliers.
""There is no doubt whatsoever that 10 percent reduction won't come from your Procter & Gamble, your Kellogg's, your Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO); that will come from medium-sized to small-sized suppliers,"" said the senior grocery industry executive.
Three years ago Coupe himself told Reuters that a major supermarket deal was a bad idea.
Since then he has become convinced an acquisition is the best way to survive the new climate, and has said he will go to court if any unfavorable ruling is not backed up by evidence. 
Securing Asda would be the crowning moment of the 58-year old's career, which has included stints at Asda itself,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), Tesco and Iceland.
Failure would raise questions about Sainsbury's strategy and Coupe's job could be in peril, analysts said. With one exit route blocked, Walmart might consider a stock market listing of Asda.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",Nippon Life president says actively exploring M&A in U.S.,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Life Insurance Co is actively seeking mergers and acquisitions overseas, with a focus on the United States and Asia's emerging economies, the president of Japan's largest life insurer said on Monday.
Japanese insurers have been among the most aggressive in overseas acquisitions. Yet, unlike smaller rivals, Nippon Life has not made a deal in the United States, except for a minority stake in asset management company TCW Group in 2017. 
""The United States is the world's largest life insurance market. We are looking for ways to expand our business there,"" President Hiroshi Shimizu told Reuters in an interview.
""We would also like to explore various possibilities in Asia's emerging countries,"" he said, but did not provide details.
While life insurers say there is still room for growth in Japan as its ageing demographics is likely to create demand for new insurance products in nursing and medical care, they are under increasing pressure to look overseas as their home market is faced with a shrinking population. 
Nippon Life is a mutual company owned by its insurance policy holders. It has made a string of acquisitions in recent years and had total assets of about 78 trillion yen ($711.6 billion) as of the end of September last year.
Last year, Nippon Life bought an 85.1 percent stake in the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group for about 100 billion yen, with the aim of tapping MassMutual's wealthy clientele. In 2016, it made a $2.5 billion purchase of smaller domestic rival Mitsui Life Insurance Co to bolster sales through bank branch networks.
With these acquisitions and a new company being readied for third-party insurance agents sales channel, Shimizu said Nippon Life has acquired units necessary for the domestic life insurance business for the time being.
The company is now shifting greater emphasis to building up overseas businesses.
Nippon Life bought an 80 percent stake in MLC Ltd, operator of Australia's fourth-largest life insurer, from National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) for A$2.4 billion in 2016.
But Nippon Life is the only one among Japan's top four private-sector life insurance companies that has not made a major acquisition in the United States.
Rival Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc (T:8750) bought U.S. insurer Protective Life Corp for about $5.6 billion in 2015, followed by Sumitomo Life's $3.7 billion acquisition of Symetra Financial Corp and Meiji Yasuda Life's $5 billion buy of StanCorp Financial Group in 2016.
""We cannot expand life insurance and asset management by ourselves alone overseas, we need to find partners that we can have long-term trust relationship with,"" Shimizu said.

""The State Government is negotiating with BHP to resolve the matter in the best interests of the State,"" Premier Mark McGowan's office said in a statement.
In its own statement, BHP said the Western Australia Mines Department had recently queried the historically accepted deductions for costs.
""It is concerning that previously audited and accepted payments to the government are now being revisited and BHP is working with the Mines Department to resolve this matter,"" it said.
BHP reached a deal to pay $390 million in additional taxes to the Australian government in November to settle a long-running tax dispute over the miner's Singapore hub on its income from 2003-2018.

Prasert also stepped down as chairman of Bangkok Dusit, Thailand's largest hospital network, and vice chairman of Bangkok Airways, the companies said in separate statements.
Late on Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand said Prasert, his daughter Poramaporn and another executive Narumon Chainaknan executed and matched trading in Bangkok Airways shares between Nov 2015 and Jan 2016 that caused price and volume to be inconsistent with market conditions.
They were fined 499.45 million baht ($15.75 million) and barred from holding directorships and executive positions in listed companies. Poramaporn, chief operating officer at Bangkok Dusit, and Narumon, executive secretary to the CEO of Bangkok Airways, also resigned from their positions on Monday.
The accused will ""prove their innocence in the matter"", the companies said.
Currently, Prasert holds 18.4 percent of Bangkok Dusit and nearly 6 percent in Bangkok Airways, while Poramaporn, has a 6.49 percent stake in the boutique airline, according to Refinitiv data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Panasonic Corp (T:6752) are set to launch a joint venture next year to produce batteries for electric vehicles (EV) in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals, a source familiar with the matter said.
The joint venture, to be owned 51 percent by Toyota and the rest by Panasonic, could also provide batteries to Toyota's EV technology partners Mazda Corp (T:7261) and Subaru Corp (T:7270), the source said on Sunday.
The source declined to be identified because the talks on the joint venture are private.
A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.
A Toyota spokesman said the two companies have been working on the battery partnership announced in 2017 and declined to comment further. Panasonic made the same comment in a statement.
The two companies may announce the joint venture plan as early as this week, according to the source.
The battery joint venture will help Toyota achieve an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030.
It will also give Panasonic cost and scale advantages in battery production at a time when China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (SZ:300750) has grown to be on par with the long-time industry leader on the back of the rapidly growing home market.
Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) current production models, could also reduce its heavy reliance on the U.S. EV maker whose production delays previously weighed on the Japanese company's earnings.
Panasonic is set to lose its exclusivity as Tesla plans to source cell production locally at a new auto plant in Shanghai, ""most likely from several companies"" including Panasonic, Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive, tweeted in November.
The reported joint venture plan boosted shares of Panasonic by as much as 4 percent on Monday, whereas Toyota shares were almost flat.
Under the planned joint venture, Panasonic would shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla will remain under the company, the source said.
Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops.

It's not clear yet how Panasonic would supply its prismatic batteries to other automotive clients, which include Honda Motor (T:7267) and Ford Motor (N:F).

(Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn has offered to post stock he owns in the automaker as collateral, surrender his passports and submit to electronic tracking as part of a renewed effort to persuade a Tokyo court to grant him bail while he awaits trial on charges of financial misconduct, a spokeswoman for the car executive said.
Ghosn, imprisoned since his arrest on Nov. 19, has asked a Tokyo District Court for the second time to grant him bail after a request last week was denied. A hearing is scheduled for Monday evening in Tokyo. 
He is willing to offer a higher bail amount to secure his release and remain in a Tokyo apartment his family has leased, the spokeswoman said, without specifying the bail amount.
""I remain imprisoned in the detention center, 64 days after I was arrested, with no release in sight,"" Ghosn said in a statement on Sunday. ""As the Court considers my bail application, I want to emphasize that I will reside in Japan and respect any and all bail conditions the Court concludes are warranted."" 
Ghosn has denied three Japanese charges of financial misconduct, including understating his salary for eight years and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan’s books.
The Tokyo court last week denied his bail application, citing concerns that he was a flight risk, which the once-feted executive disputes.
Ghosn had planned to make his way to France if released and return to Japan for trial, but now intends to stay put, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
""I will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,"" Ghosn said in the statement. ""I am not guilty of the charges against me and I look forward to defending my reputation in the courtroom. Nothing is more important to me or to my family.""
The Japanese government could not be reached immediately for comment. The Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office said it was not in a position to comment. 
A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on Japanese judicial proceedings. It has said the company's internal investigation had uncovered ""substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct"" involving Ghosn and that the probe is ongoing and broadening.
Ghosn’s lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, expects his client to be held until trial, which he said could begin in about six months.
If granted bail, Ghosn said he would remain in a Tokyo apartment and wear a tracking device to monitor his whereabouts, the spokeswoman said. Ghosn would also pay for private security guards approved by local authorities to watch him, report daily to Japanese prosecutors and refrain from speaking to individuals who might be witnesses in his case, the spokeswoman said. 
Ghosn has not spoken to his family since being detained, the spokeswoman said.
Ghosn spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, and his arrest has jolted the auto industry, while muddying the outlook for Nissan's three-way alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).
Renault, which dominates the partnership through its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is expected to meet within days to consider potential candidates to replace Ghosn as chief executive officer and chairman.

353,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Tokyo's Top Stock Surges 305% in Year But CFO Sees It as Cheap,"(Bloomberg) -- The best-performing stock in Tokyo quadrupled last year, but its chief financial officer says it’s still cheap.
BrainPad Inc. posted a 305 percent gain, the best among the more than 2,100 constituents of the benchmark Topix index, as the data analysis company’s profit started to strengthen, reassuring investors of its ability to make money. That won’t be a one-off phenomenon for the consultant to firms including Google’s Japan unit, Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan Corp. and Japan Airlines Co., because earnings are now on a solid growth track, according to CFO Ko Ishikawa.
BrainPad, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze consumption trends for its customers, surprised investors last January when it reported operating profit that was triple its own forecast for the second half of 2017. That came after earnings had been shrinking for much of the decade. The news sent shares on a tear.
“People have finally realized that we’re a company capable of making good profit,” Ishikawa said in an interview at BrainPad’s Tokyo headquarters.
The surge in 2018 has pushed BrainPad’s market value to almost $400 million. The stock trades at 87 times estimated earnings. That’s far higher than the average of 12 times for companies in the Topix, but lower than some peers such as CrowdWorks Inc., which trades at 653 times expected profits. For Ishikawa, that means the shares have room to rise.
“Other AI companies have much higher valuations than us,” he said. “We’re still undervalued.”
BrainPad uses AI technology to analyze large pools of data on behalf of clients. For example, in a recent project for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc., the company used deep learning technology to pool tens of thousands of photos from social-media networks to analyze what people were doing when they drank coke. The results included unexpected outcomes such as mountain climbing, helping Coca-Cola come up with new marketing ideas, according to Ishikawa. More companies are relying on AI to analyze their consumer bases, he said.
Rowan Ewart-White, a London-based director at Storm Research Ltd., which doesn’t have a rating on the stock, agrees that BrainPad is positioned to grow over the long term as AI becomes more mainstream. But more immediately, he reckons BrainPad is set to fall after its strong gain last year.
“Whilst acknowledging the company’s long-term growth potential, we believe patient investors will be rewarded with a more attractive entry level in 2019,” he said.
There are already signs of cooling -- or at least more volatility. BrainPad fell 36 percent from its record high in November through a low on Jan. 10. Since then, it’s gained more than 20 percent.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>","Australia's solar, wind boom to power past grid woes in 2019","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's wind and solar boom looks set to power through 2019 following a record year, despite grid constraints and extra scrutiny from network operators to make sure new projects don't spark blackouts like ones that hit two years ago. 
Abundant wind and sun, falling turbine and panel costs, and corporate demand for contracts to hedge against rising power tariffs have attracted dozens of international developers looking to build wind and solar farms Down Under. 
Even though the developers have met with flip-flops on energy policy, a strained grid that has trouble integrating intermittent renewable power, and unexpected hook-up costs, they still see Australia as a growth market. 
""We believe that we have a great future in Australia, because we have the right answers,"" said Xavier Barbaro, Chief Executive of France's  Neoen  (PA:NEOEN), whose biggest market is Australia. 
Companies like Neoen, its compatriot Total-Eren (PA:TOTF), India's Adani (NS:ADEL), U.S. utility AES Corp (N:AES) and Germany's Sonnen are expanding in Australia, looking to fill a gap as ageing coal-fired plants are retired over the next two decades. 
""Confidence is high as the industry enters 2019, with unprecedented levels of construction activity under way,"" said Anna Freeman, a director at the Clean Energy Council, an industry group. 
Australia generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from renewables. This is forecast to jump to 75 percent over the next 20 years. 
A total of 14.7 gigawatts (GW) of large-scale solar and wind projects worth A$20 billion ($14 billion) were under construction or reached financial close last year, more than double 2017's record, according to the Clean Energy Council. 
(Graphic: Australia's renewable power - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ROVMyc)
This rush of projects, with no clear guidance on where they best fit, led to an ""element of anarchy"", but that is changing, said Simon Currie, founder of advisory firm Energy Estate. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the energy council and network companies are working out clear guidelines on where to build plants and how to connect them to the grid. 
""We're moving from what was an opportunistic-based approach ... into something that will be much more planned,"" said Currie, whose company wants to develop Australia's biggest renewable energy hub, with 4 GW of wind, solar and pumped hydro capacity in New South Wales. 
Renewable projects added to the grid have grown from 22 with 1.2 GW of capacity in 2013 to a record 45 projects with 2.9 GW added in 2018, AEMO said. There are 114 more applications representing 15.9 GW pending, indicating plenty of potential congestion ahead. 
The biggest challenge is that developers are all vying to connect to a grid running 5,000 km (3,100 miles) from Queensland in the north to South Australia and Tasmania. 
(See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2AGa36n) 
This grid was designed to deliver power mainly from always-on coal-fired plants near three big mining areas, while wind and solar farms generate intermittent power from more remote sites, where network capacity can be limited. 
To keep the grid stable, equipment such as ""synchronous condensers"" or batteries need to be added, which can increase costs by at least $20 million for a condenser alone. Batteries could be much higher. 
Developers who failed to account for these issues have run into delays on project approvals or grid hook-up, bringing unanticipated costs, which in one case, led to the collapse of engineering firm RCR Tomlinson (AX:RCR) last November. 
(Graphic: Solar power needs the sun - https://tmsnrt.rs/2B1WOgT)
HOOK-UP HICCUPS 
A Clean Energy Council survey of senior executives in December found grid connection is the biggest industry concern heading into 2019, Freeman said. 
UK-based solar investor Octopus Investments said grid issues were what took it two years to choose its first investment in Australia. The Darlington Point solar farm is about to begin construction and will be the country's largest. 
""The grid is the biggest issue where assets fail in our project filter,"" Octopus Managing Director Sam Reynolds told Reuters, declining to name projects the company rejected. 
Developers and project lenders said they need to consider grid congestion, which can curtail power that gets to the network from any one plant; intermittency of wind and solar power, which affects current flow; and transmission losses, called marginal loss factors (MLFs). 
""There's a bit of nervousness around MLFs, curtailment, and then there's construction and commissioning risk,"" said Stephen Panizza, head of renewable energy at Federation Asset Management. 
MLFs measure energy lost over power networks and have been increasing, with renewable projects being on the outer reaches of the grid, weakening returns for some operators. 
Another factor is the cost of the extra technology to keep current steady on the grid as more intermittent power is added. 
In November, France's Total-Eren (PA:TOTF) agreed to buy a synchronous condenser to secure a connection agreement so it could build the A$330 million Kiamal solar farm in Victoria. 
Delays due to talks with AEMO about the condenser, however, led to Total-Eren losing one of its power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
Total-Eren's Asia Pacific director, Michael Vawser, says other projects will face the same trouble. 
""I do think there are other projects ... caught off-guard by new grid regulations that will lose their PPAs through delays in being allowed to connect to the grid,"" Vawser told Reuters in an interview in November. 
Neoen, which has built 1 GW of wind and solar farms and the world's biggest battery in Australia over the past four years, said in a recent prospectus it had collected 14 million euros ($16 million) in damages from a contractor building three solar farms because of hook-up delays. 
Despite the challenges, Neoen, Total-Eren and their rivals are still scouring Australia for more opportunities.
""Australia is still an attractive market for us,"" Vawser said.

The German carmaker is still reeling from a 2015 scandal over cheating on emissions tests and needs to ramp up production of electric vehicles to meet toughened European emmissions-cutting targets.
""We have the clear goal of making electromobility accessible to a broad section of the population, that is to make it affordable,"" Hans-Dieter Poetsch told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
But he said it could be difficult to maintain the prices of many entry-level vehicles.
""The current price level cannot stay the same if these cars are equipped with electric motors,"" said Poetsch. ""Therefore, it will inevitably lead to significant price increases in the small car segment.""
Poetsch referred to the tougher-than-expected targets to cut greenhouse emissions from cars by 37.5 percent by 2030, which the European Union agreed in December.
Volkswagen said in December it may have to step up plans for mass production of electric vehicles to meet the EU targets. 
VW plans to spend almost 44 billion euros on developing electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by 2023.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The co-chair of a committee set up by Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) to examine the root cause of alleged financial misconduct by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn said he believed Ghosn may have had questionable ethical standards.
Ghosn, charged with three counts of financial misconduct, has been detained in Tokyo since his arrest on Nov. 19. Ghosn denies the charges against him, which include understating his salary for eight years and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books.
""Having read the report on the internal investigation, my initial impression was that the head of the company may have had questionable ethical standards,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing late on Sunday after the panel held its first meeting.
Ghosn said on Sunday he would follow restrictions by authorities in Japan in exchange for his release from jail in the latest effort to persuade a court to grant him bail while he awaits trial.
Ghosn, in a statement released in New York, also said he looked forward to defending his reputation in court. 
""Nothing is more important to me or to my family,"" he said. 
Nishioka, a former judge, added that he also saw problems with Nissan's governance, including the process of determining compensation for directors. 
The panel, comprising three Nissan external directors and four third-party members, expects to meet three or four times before making recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.
All seven members attended the first meeting in Tokyo, including Jean-Baptiste Duzan, an external director based in France. 
For four hours, they discussed issues with two people involved with Nissan including how power had been heavily concentrated with Ghosn for years, Nishioka said, and possible ways to avoid such focus in the future.
Nishioka added that such a concentration of authority in one person was ""questionable"".
MOUNTING ALLEGATIONS
Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), in which Nissan owns a controlling 34 percent stake, have been conducting their own internal investigations into alleged wrongdoing by Ghosn. 
On Friday both accused him of improperly receiving $9 million in compensation from a joint venture between the two automakers, raising the possibility that the former boss of the Nissan-Renault alliance could face a fresh charge of embezzlement.
Separate internal investigations have found evidence that a small group of people at both companies helped to carry out or approve transactions including secret compensation and payments on Ghosn's handful of residences, people with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.
The arrest of Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, and the charges against him have jolted the auto industry, while muddying the outlook for Nissan's three-way alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors.
Renault, which dominates the partnership through its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is expected to meet within days to consider potential candidates to replace Ghosn as CEO and chairman, sources have told Reuters.
Despite repeated requests by Renault that Nissan hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting as soon as possible to select a new chairman, Nissan plans to wait for the committee's recommendations before making its nomination. Nissan's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for June. 
Nishioka said the committee had yet to discuss possible procedures for chairman selection or governance issues related to the Nissan-Renault partnership including its capital structure. He did not rule out such discussions in the future.
France's government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault and has long pushed for a closer tie-up between Renault and Nissan, has told Tokyo that it will seek an integration of the two companies, most likely under a single holding company, the Nikkei business newspaper reported on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Ghosn's wife, Carole Ghosn, has written to French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss her husband's situation, her public relations representative said.
The representative, Devon Spurgeon, confirmed a report in French paper Journal du Dimanche that a letter had been sent to Macron this month, but declined to provide details.
Before his arrest, Ghosn had been working towards making the alliance ""irreversible"" and told Reuters in October that potential changes to the partnership's structure would come by June 2020. 
Nissan owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault.

The strike comes amid an expected rise in electricity consumption for heating due to a cold weather snap this week, according to forecasts.
France, unlike neighbor Germany, depends mostly on electricity for heating during prolonged cold spells. Power demand increases by around 2.5 gigawatts for every 1 degree drop in the average temperature below seasonal levels in France.

RTE's forecast showed that the average temperature will remain around 4 degrees below the seasonal norm for most of the week, with the average daily peak consumption at over 85 gigawatts (GW), reaching about 90 GW on Thursday.

ROME (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) has suffered a setback in its plan to assuage pressures for a separation of its prized network assets by placing them into a wholly owned subsidiary, as the industry regulator said it was opposed to the proposal.
TIM has been under pressure for years from Italian politicians, regulators and rivals to separate and upgrade its network, which analysts have valued at up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion).
Before being ousted in November former TIM chief Amos Genish set out a plan to spin off the network into a fully controlled separate company, but communications regulator AGCOM has given an initial thumbs down to the idea since TIM would continue to have significant power in the market.
In a document published on its website the watchdog said it was launching a 45-day public consultation on the plan, results of which would help it draw up a final decision in coming months.
A spokesman for TIM declined comment.
Italy's biggest phone group gives rivals such as  Vodafone  (L:VOD), Wind and Fastweb (S:SCMN) access to its network infrastructure, but also competes with them when it sells its own telecom services to customers. 
AGCOM said that under TIM's plan, by keeping control of the new company it would be in the position of being able to favor its own companies to the detriment of competitors.
Pressure on TIM to spin off its fixed access network intensified after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the Italian phone group's biggest shareholder with a 24 percent stake, named Genish at the helm of the group in September 2017 and began to exert greater influence, which upset the Italian government.
Since coming to power in June the government has placed the creation of a fast broadband network at the heart of its industrial policy and is drafting measures to help create one single network player for the country, which could combine TIM's network with that of smaller rival Open Fiber.
TIM has also been caught since early last year in a battle between Vivendi and U.S. activist fund Elliott over how to revive the Italian company, which is saddled with 25 billion euros of debt.

TIM appointed Luigi Gubitosi as chief executive in November.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has sacked two executives of state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) for allegedly failing to prevent a $2 billion fraud, two sources said on Sunday, nearly a year after the country's biggest bank scam came to light and also dragged the government into the controversy.
The firing of the two executive directors, whom the federal police have accused of breaching central bank guidelines, is the first instance of sacking of the bank's employees since it said that billionaire diamond jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle had for years fraudulently raised billions of dollars in foreign credit by conspiring with staff at the bank.
Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, who left India before the fraud was discovered, have denied the accusations.
In a stock exchange filing late on Friday, the country’s second-biggest state bank said the government had removed K. Veera Brahmaji Rao and Sanjiv Sharan ""from the office of executive director"" with immediate effect. The filing did not give a reason.
The government then fired them because ""they failed to use global payments network SWIFT to detect the fraud"", a bank source said. The sources who had direct knowledge of the matter and declined to be identified because the reasons for the sacking have not been made public.
""They were not able to supervise and there was dereliction of duty on their part,"" said one of the sources, a government official.
Phone calls to PNB Chief Executive Sunil Mehta as well as to Rao and Sharan went unanswered.
The 124-year-old bank has in recent months reinstated most of the 21 employees who were suspended immediately after the scam became public because they were not charged by police.
POLITICAL ISSUE
India has issued non-bailable warrants against both Modi and Choksi and Interpol red notices are out too, but their continued evading of the law is being used by India's main opposition Congress party to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the lead up to a general election due by May.
""Your money, money of our tribal brothers, lower castes, farmers was taken away and you did not even realize,"" Congress President Rahul Gandhi said in a state election rally late last year. ""Nirav Modi fled after taking the money, Mehul Choksi also fled with him.""
The BJP, meanwhile, says the fraud began when Congress was in power.
Investigations into the case had been slowed by a public spat between the top-two officials in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian equivalent of the U.S. FBI, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
A CBI spokesman did not have an immediate comment on the matter.
India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), which fights financial crime, has seized assets worth millions of dollars of both jewellers.
A senior ED investigator told Reuters late last year that they were confident both Modi and Choksi would be brought back to the country ""soon"". He said the Indian embassies in the UK, where Modi is believed to be in, and the one in Antigua, where Choksi is, were in constant touch with authorities with information about them.
""We know fear bells have started ringing there,"" said the ED investigator, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to reporters. ""We want them to be brought back to India before the elections.""

A call to the ED office went unanswered.

(TSXV: FIRE) (OTCQX: SPRWF) (FRA: 53S1), announces that as of calendar year-end, 7ACRES has 19 completed flowering rooms and is on track for all 25 flowering rooms to be completed in March 2019.
Once completed, 7ACRES will have a greenhouse footprint of approximately 300,000 square feet, with the total facility reaching over 440,000 square feet. Supreme Cannabis expects 7ACRES to reach its estimated annual output of 50,000 kg by the middle of calendar 2019. 
Construction update
Management believes the 7ACRES facility is unique in Canada for its ability to produce high-quality cannabis on a commercial scale. Each of the facility’s modular flowering rooms utilize industry-leading HPS lighting technology to provide “indoor” quality lighting that is supplemented by the sun to improve terpene and cannabinoid production.
The facility’s modular design allows each flowering room to provide variable environmental conditions tailored to the specific needs of the crop in production, while also reducing the risk of crop loss.
An updated timeline of construction completion is as follows:
December 2018 – 19 total flowering rooms completed.

January 2019 – 3 additional flowering rooms are expected to be completed.
February 2019 – 1 additional flowering room is expected to be completed.
March 2019 – 2 additional flowering rooms are expected to be completed, representing the completion of all 25 flowering rooms.
Mid-2019 – primary office and administrative area are expected to be completed.

Expansion of the facility is subject to Health Canada regulatory approvals. As flowering rooms are completed, Supreme Cannabis intends to look for opportunities to streamline the Health Canada review process, such as by having groups of completed rooms reviewed simultaneously for licensing.
“We are thrilled with the progress made at our facility in Kincardine, Ontario and are excited to announce that we are nearing completion for all of our flowering rooms,” said John Fowler, President & Founder of Supreme Cannabis. ""In our view, 7ACRES sets the international standard for cannabis cultivation and allows us to grow craft-quality cannabis at scale. We believe consumer behaviour has validated our thesis that people prefer higher-quality flower and are willing to pay more for it, and as the market expands for derivative products such as vape pens and edibles we expect consumers will prefer products extracted from the highest quality inputs.

Citing a letter to the Economy Ministry, Spiegel said Rheinmetall intends to sue the German government for loss of revenue if the export suspension continues.
Berlin suspended approval of future export licenses to Saudi Arabia in October and in November said it had worked with industry to halt shipments of arms sales that were already approved.
No specific timetable was given at the time, but industry sources told Reuters an agreement had been struck to revisit the matter by mid-January.
Last week the economy ministry said the government still had no intention of approving arms exports to Saudi Arabia.
Without citing sources, Spiegel said Rheinmetall believes it can claim for compensation because the government's decision affected exports that had already been approved.
The company's management fears shareholders could sue Rheinmetall if the company does not demand compensation for the losses, Spiegel added.
""We cannot comment on individual decisions, possible revocations or individual measures,"" the Economy Ministry said in an emailed statement.
A spokesman for Rheinmetall declined to comment on the report.
Spiegel said goods worth up to 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) are affected by the export suspension, including four Cobra radar systems built by a consortium that includes France's Thales, Airbus and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) of the United States.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",Sorrell's S4 Capital seeks more deals in digital-only drive,"By Douglas Busvine
MUNICH (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell is on the lookout for acquisitions to expand his new advertising venture S4 Capital, aiming to capitalize on the disruption sweeping the industry by pursuing a pure-play digital strategy.
Sorrell, who was ousted from WPP (LON:WPP) last April after three decades building it into the world's largest advertising holding company, started again with the purchase of S4 as a shell and has clinched two deals so far.
He outbid WPP in July for Dutch digital advertising agency Media Monks for 300 million euros (£264.8 million pounds) and in December bought San Francisco-based programmatic advertising company MightyHive for an enterprise value of $150 million.
""It's a good base, but we need to do more - we need to do more organically and we need to do more by acquisition,"" Sorrell told Reuters on the sidelines of the DLD Munich technology conference.
Sorrell founded WPP in 1985 and stunned the advertising world two years later by launching a $566 million (£439.4 million) hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Then, in 1989, WPP bought Ogilvy Group for $864 million.
This time, however, 73-year-old Sorrell wants to keep S4 digital-only and build on core competences in content and programmatic advertising, which involves automated distribution of ads across the internet.
Sorrell plans to offer digital content, analytics and distribution to help clients to reach customers in a rapidly changing media environment that he views as an opportunity rather than a threat.
He said he would be interested in buying first-party data assets, though this could be an expensive proposition. He also wants to expand S4's geographical coverage - it now has around 1,200 staff in a dozen countries - into Germany.
""Much of it actually depends on serendipity,"" said Sorrell, recalling the early years at WPP.
""Did I think we would buy a company 13 times our size in '87? The answer's 'No'. We have to see what is going to happen because the industry is in a state of disruption.""
DIGITAL DOMINANCE
His strategy reflects the rise of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to dominate online advertising. Both are 'walled gardens', meaning that they rather than the marketer effectively control the relationship with consumers.
Major brands, meanwhile, are seeking to re-establish a direct connection to customers and the all-important data that reveals whether they might buy a product or service.
Working with that first-party data is where Sorrell and S4 come in, by designing and delivering online advertising to the likes of viewers of video streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Sorrell's vision of S4 as a purely digital business also reflects his thinking on the predicament faced by big advertising holding companies, including WPP.
These have lost business to the Silicon Valley giants while also becoming too big and complex to respond to rapidly changing technology and client needs.
Sorrell, still a shareholder in WPP, gave a lukewarm assessment of restructuring efforts under new management headed by Mark Read. He said that some steps - such as merging U.S. agency Young & Rubicam with digital vehicle VML - had been under discussion while he was still at the helm.
""To be fair and frank, I don't think there's much change, but there's a lot of talk,"" said Sorrell.
Sorrell reckons it is too soon to write off the advertising holding companies, however, singling out Japan's Dentsu as the strongest of the global players. ""It mirrors S4,"" he added with a smile.
He predicts a ""bumpy"" year for the global economy, but the combination of a possible slowdown with attempts by the advertising industry to reinvent itself is one that is, on balance, positive for S4.

""The good news is that S4 Capital is a clean sheet of paper,"" he said. ""The holding companies are prisoners of history and the disruption.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) has warned employees in Brazil that new investments there depend on a painful plan to return to profit in the country, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Saturday.
In a message posted at Brazilian plants, GM's top executive in Brazil and Argentina, Carlos Zarlenga, said after running up a heavy loss over the past three years the operation had reached ""a critical moment that will require sacrifices from everyone.""
The memo referenced comments that Chief Executive Mary Barra made during investor presentations last week about challenges in South America. ""We are not going to keep deploying capital to lose money,"" she said, in a quote repeated by Zarlenga.
GM representatives in Brazil did not immediately comment on the memo, which was first reported by newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo.
The dire tone came as a shock to some workers in Brazil, where GM has overtaken Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) to become the industry sales leader as the economy rebounds slowly from a deep slump.
Union leader Renato Almeida called GM's statement ""absurd.""
""The company is going through a good moment in Brazil,"" said Almeida, vice president of a metalworkers union in Sao Jose dos Campos. ""There is no justification for them to suggest they would shut down operations.""
In April 2018, Zarlenga touted a new family of low-cost cars hitting Brazilian dealerships this year as he played up progress in an interview with Reuters. He said cost reductions in the downturn, including a 35 percent cut to the Brazilian workforce, contributed to a narrow profit in South America in 2017.
While Brazil's economy has gradually recovered after a 2015-16 recession, Argentina fell back into recession last year as inflation surged and its currency cratered. Investors are watching to see if the presidents of both countries can pull off the tough economic reforms they have promised.
Zarlenga said regional executives had prepared a ""viability plan"" for senior management in Detroit, but they still need the support of local unions, suppliers, dealerships and government. ""GM investments and our future depend on this plan,"" he said.
Last year, Brazil's government granted carmakers a 15-year package of tax breaks – extending subsidies for an industry that has struggled to compete directly with production elsewhere.

Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who took office with a new government this month, has said Brazil cannot afford to keep subsidizing powerful industries, arguing that an end to protectionist policies will make the economy more competitive.

369,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 10:17AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. U.S. Nearing Energy Independence (to Saudi Arabia’s Chagrin)
Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC are battling the U.S. for influence on oil prices.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih sent oil prices rallying earlier this month when he said he’ll slice another 100,000 barrels per day in crude exports in February. On the other side, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude production reached 11.9 million bpd last week.
But while headlines on production numbers weighed on market sentiment, another important forecast by the EIA this week went almost unnoticed.
The U.S., which is currently the world's second-largest oil importer after China, may be less than two years away from energy independence.
The U.S. has already virtually achieved the EIA’s 2019 production forecast of 12 million bpd, and the EIA is expecting 13 million bpd by 2020. It also thinks net imports of oil into the U.S. will dwindle to 1.1 million bpd by the end of this year and reach just 100,000 bpd in 2020.
In the final three months of 2020, the EIA thinks the U.S. will become a net exporter by about 900,000 bpd.
While there’s no guarantee all these will happen, the potential loss of the world’s second-largest oil importer will be a huge headache for the Saudis, who are fighting to preserve market share even now as they cut supplies to boost prices.
But if the EIA is right, al-Falih might not have to worry about cutting supplies to the U.S. anymore after 2020 and the U.S. might also be competing to export to the same markets as the Saudis and OPEC.
2. A Rising Netflix Price Lifts All Boats?
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) made a big bet on the strength of its content after hiking U.S. prices. It may have also given its rivals a boost.
  Disney  , or more accurately its upcoming entertainment streaming service Disney+, is set to benefit, analysts said.
With the launch of Disney+ due this year, Netflix’s price hike increases ""the price umbrella"" Disney can charge for its streaming service, Loop Capital said. That may give Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares a boost. They're up just 1.5% this year. Netflix is up nearly 27% even with Friday's slip.
While many will point to Netflix's stellar slate of binge-worthy content as a driver behind its decision to raise prices, Disney boasts an envious and far-wider-reaching lineup. Disney has been in the content game since, well, the days of Walt Disney.
Wall Street and Netflix are confident the company’s price increase will not see a wave of subscribers jump ship. It’s firing on all cylinders and its public profile won some glitz and glamour after it scooped up numerous awards at the Golden Globes. The hit movie “Birdbox” provided further evidence that Netflix's massive cash burn, an estimated $3 billion last year and this year, is bearing fruit (subscribers).
With a full slate of its top shows due this year, including “Stranger Things,” “Orange Is The New Black” and “The Crown,” Netflix has every reason to be confident that customers will stay on the couch and chill.
Looking ahead, a successful Netflix price hike could suggest U.S. consumers feel compelled to pony up for subscriptions services that have become ubiquitous in everyday life. That strengthens the case for other services, including Amazon’s Prime and Apple’s Music service, to join in on the hike, potentially boosting earnings.
3. Loss of a Planet Highlights Stumbling Video Game Makers
A long time ago, in a market far, far away, investors weren’t forced to pay attention to Star Wars. But in the days where content is king and Lucasfilm was worth $4 billion to Disney, it’s wise to be apprised of the happenings of Jedi and Sith.
For example, you may have missed an entire planet (Alderan?) disappearing on Wednesday.
Video game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has shelved development of an open-world Star Wars game, Kotaku reported.
This sent some ripples through the gaming community given the popularity of open-world games, where players can explore the realm of the game independently, not forced to follow a linear storyline. That leads to hours more gameplay as winning the game becomes relative.
While a disappointment for gamers, investors should also be concerned about what looks like another own-goal from the video game companies. Stocks have been struggling to gain any sort of upward momentum as the major companies -- EA, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive -- keep making headlines for gaffes, not triumphs.
EA, which is down about 20% over the last year, managed to finish Wednesday higher despite the report, but fell Thursday following a downgrade. Jefferies analyst Timothy O’Shea cut the stock to hold from buy and its price target to $95 from $139, saying the company may have “lost its creative way.”O’Shea noted that analysts and investors “know next to nothing” about EA’s other Star Wars title “Jedi Fallen Order.”
Shares of EA haven’t recovered from the dive they took late August when the company delayed the release of its much-anticipated “Battlefield V” by a month to make “adjustments.”
Rival Activision, which is down 30% in the last 12 months, has had its share of blunders, losing the CFOs of its Activision and Blizzard divisions back to back and having to let go of its underperforming “Destiny” franchise.
Even Take-Two, which had a big success with “Red Dead Redemption 2” -- lauded as an excellent open-world game -- is down 8% over the last 12 months.
The company was forced to respond to sharp criticism of the way the economy worked in the beta version of “Red Dead Online,” which was to be a strong source of revenue from microtransactions. Critics said the online version was released too early and forced players to use too much real-world currency to enhance gameplay."
370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>","From Craft Brews to Car Bills, Shutdown Hits American Confidence","(Bloomberg) -- Atlanta restaurateur Deborah VanTrece quietly put a notice on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Monday night inviting furloughed federal workers to her Southern (NYSE:SO) eatery for a free meal on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. She wasn’t prepared for what came next.
“By Tuesday it had exploded,” said VanTrece of Twisted Soul Cookhouse and Pours. Some 500 people have called in about it, and she’s had to extend the luncheon by two hours to accommodate the demand. So many people have called from all federal agencies “to the point that it’s started to scare me about the trickle-down effect of the shutdown.”
She’s not the only one nervous. U.S. consumer sentiment tumbled to the lowest level since October 2016 and future expectations dimmed, according to figures released Friday, giving fresh evidence that concerns about the government shutdown are creeping into the American psyche.
Lowest Level
The University of Michigan’s preliminary January sentiment index fell to 90.7 from the prior month, missing all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists, according to a report Friday. The measures of current conditions and expectations both declined to the lowest since President Donald Trump’s election in 2016.
Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, attributed the drop to “a host of issues including the partial government shutdown, the impact of tariffs, instabilities in financial markets, the global slowdown, and the lack of clarity about monetary policies.”
For all the hand-wringing over furloughed public employees, most economic forecasters still don’t expect it to cause too much pain to growth so long as it doesn’t drag on for months. For starters, an event affecting about 800,000 workers is a relatively small portion of a U.S. labor force totaling 163 million people. And there’s a snapback effect: The drag to gross domestic product that the shutdown is causing now will turn into a propellant when the stalemate ends and people get paid again.
According to the median forecast in a Jan. 15-17 Bloomberg survey, analysts project the federal government will reopen by mid-February, though if the closure lasts through March, the disruption will cause economic growth to dip below 2 percent this quarter. At the same time, just under half say the government impasse increases the probability of a recession this year.
More Dire Predictions
The relatively sanguine assessment is at odds with some more dire recent predictions, including by  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). The White House itself doubled the estimated negative fallout.
Federal workers deemed non-essential are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits but they have to repay the assistance when their checks with back pay eventually arrive. About 15,000 applied for weekly jobless benefits during the first two weeks of the shutdown, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday.
Still, some small businesses with federal contracts or waiting on government actions are sweating the delays. In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, former schoolteacher Thomas Monti and his business partner are building out a new craft brewery, Schoolhouse Brewing, and waiting on a license from the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. It normally takes 45 to 60 days to get such a license - unless the government shuts down, Monti said.
“Being former teachers, we are used to bureaucracy,” he said. “We are staying optimistic that the shutdown is going to end sooner rather than later. But is it a concern? Yes, we can’t open our business without doing this.""
For others who are affected, an extended period without income may leave lasting damage to their personal finances as they dip into savings to make ends meet or run up expensive credit-card debt.
Brandon Long, 33, an investigative specialist at the Department of Justice, was declared an essential employee, meaning he has to report to work even though staff has been furloughed.
Falling Behind
His schedule is erratic, so he can’t arrange for another job to help pay the bills. Even if he could, the father of five with a stay-at-home spouse said the government sets strict rules on doing part-time work. Long, who was last paid on Dec. 29, is supposed to get another check on Friday Jan. 25.
After falling behind on his car payment, car insurance, his student loan and other bills, he launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise $500 for groceries, rent (due in a couple of weeks), baby formula, diapers, wipes. As of Friday afternoon, he’d raised $650. They’ve nearly depleted their savings.
“Me and my wife sacrificed a lot to get our credit in a good place, and we were hoping to get a house next year,” said Long, who’s worried the late payments will damage their credit rating.
“You gotta live this squeaky-clean lifestyle to get a job in government,” he said. “You do all this stuff, and now I’m getting punished for something I have nothing to do with.”"

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) operates mostly outside the Apple-sphere, and that is exactly why whatever it says next week about business in its vital Chinese market matters so much for investors.
Apple (O:AAPL) rattled global markets this month when the iPhone maker cut its revenue outlook for the first time in 15 years, blaming factors like the U.S.-China trade dispute and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.
Upcoming quarterly scorecards from Intel, Texas Instruments (O:TXN) and other chipmakers, as well as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), will shed light on whether Apple made a convenient excuse for its own troubles or revealed a strengthening headwind faced by global companies that rely on China for a big chunk of their sales.
""They should give us a good gauge of what is happening in China beyond smartphones because Texas Instruments is mostly industrials and autos, and Intel is PCs and servers, and they're not being driven by the Apple smartphone situation,"" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. 
Underscoring Wall Street's sensitivity to China trade, the S&P 500 (SPX) jumped 1.3 percent on Friday after a report that China has offered to go on a six-year buying spree to ramp up U.S. imports in order to reconfigure the relationship between the two countries. (N) 
U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
China accounts for almost a quarter of Intel's revenue, while modem chips for iPhones, the focus of recent concerns about Apple, account for just a tiny part of Intel's business. 
While most Intel processors sold in China are used to build laptops and servers for export, Chinese consumers and companies also purchase many of those devices.
With the tariff war already taking a toll on China's trade sector and increasing the risk of a sharper slowdown in the world's second largest economy, U.S. multinationals will face pressure to be cautious about their outlooks for 2019.
""Anyone doing business in China, especially if you are an American company - I don't think you can come out with super-positive guidance,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
Texas Instruments and programmable chipmaker Xilinx (O:XLNX), both reporting on Wednesday, and Intel, reporting on Thursday, are among the S&P 500 companies most reliant on China for their revenue. Investors will listen closely to what those companies may say about how the China trade dispute and the country's cooling economic expansion are affecting demand for their products.
Also on Wednesday, Ford's quarterly report will give investors a glimpse of the automaker's progress trying to reverse a sales slump in China, the world's biggest car market.
Other chipmakers and related companies reporting next week include ASML Holding (AS:ASML), Lam Research (O:LRCX), SK Hynix (KS:000660) and  Western Digital  (O:WDC). 
LOWER EXPECTATIONS
Fears about the impact of the trade conflict on U.S. technology companies crystallized this month after Apple (O:AAPL) cut its sales forecast, blaming China's economy.
Diminished expectations for chipmakers account for most of a recent steep drop in expectations for tech sector earnings growth in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In October, analysts on average forecast S&P 500 technology companies would increase their earnings per share by 8.5 percent in 2019, according to Refinitiv. But expectations for 2019 tech EPS growth have since withered to just 2.2 percent.
Still, many Silicon Valley companies remain in favor among investors. Technology was the third most recommended sector among 13 big research firms recently surveyed by Reuters, behind healthcare and financials.
With the S&P 500 recently trading at 15 times expected earnings, down from 18 times a year ago, a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after December's selloff. But if Apple's warning about slow China demand is repeated by Intel, Texas Instruments and others, the S&P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) is down about 15 percent from its high in March 2018, as chipmakers struggle with a cooling smartphone industry and slower demand for memory chips used in cars, industrial equipment and other markets. 
While Wall Street gained this month due to optimism that the trade dispute will be resolved, China for years has struggled to maintain its pace of economic growth. Even a quick end to the trade dispute would not guarantee a return to strong results from U.S. companies' China operations.
""Trade may be pointed to as a reason for issues with input costs or weakness in sales, but I think that just as important is the fact that the economy in China is slowing, and they are incremental buyers for both semiconductors and cars,"" said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
In Intel's October quarterly conference call, Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said the company was working to reduce the impact on its supply chain from potential new tariffs.
Analysts, on average, expect Intel to report fourth-quarter revenue up 11 percent to $19 billion, and to forecast 2019 revenue will rise 3 percent to $73.2 billion, according to Refinitiv.

Analysts expect Texas Instruments to grow net income by 10 percent in the December quarter then shrink in 2019, according to Refinitiv.

The union also instructed local union negotiators to reject similar proposals being made at talks taking place around the United States, the sources said.
The USW and Shell began negotiations on Wednesday for a new national agreement governing pay, health insurance, job security, and safety for 30,000 workers at U.S. refineries and chemical plants.
A Shell spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Friday night.
Royal Dutch Shell's U.S. arm, Shell Oil Co, represents the U.S. oil industry. Shell has been the lead company in oil worker contract negotiations since 1997. 
The proposal for an automatic extension of the contract could undermine the union's National Oil Bargaining Program, which tries to keep the national agreement and as many local contracts on the same expiration date, the sources said.
These are the first negotiations for a national contract since 2015 when a stalemate led to rolling strikes that sent more than 7,000 workers off their jobs at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. 
The 2015 strike lasted about two months at most plants, but continued for months at some locations. 

The USW is seeking a three-year agreement with the oil industry that would replace the pact that expires on Feb. 1. The union's proposals include an 8 percent annual wage increase for each year of the contract. Union members with four years' experience earn about $40 an hour.

Wagering or gaming contracts are not recognized in Malaysia, which means casinos do not have legal recourse for the gambling dues owed to them by its clients. 
But in the Wynn case against the Malaysian fund manager, the casino's lawyers said they weren't seeking dues from a wagering contract but from a credit agreement that the Malaysian had failed to honor. 
Wynn brought the lawsuit against Paul Poh Yang Hong in 2017 for HK$33 million ($4.21 million) he owed the casino. 
Poh took a line of credit of HK$40 million from Wynn, and he had paid down to about HK$33 million before Wynn sued him, Vincent Law, Wynn's attorney told Reuters.
Poh had said at an earlier court hearing he was not aware he had signed a credit agreement and that he did not owe the casino HK$40 million. 
Judge S. Nantha Balan ruled in chambers on Friday that Poh will have to pay the outstanding amount of HK$33 million plus interest to Wynn, Law told Reuters at a Kuala Lumpur court. 
Poh's lawyer declined to comment on the ruling or whether they would appeal. 

""If there is no appeal, I believe this judgment today will be the law in Malaysia for the foreseeable future,"" Law said. ""It is a good sign for the whole gaming industry.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - LJM Partners Ltd on Friday filed a lawsuit against unnamed parties it holds responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars it lost after last year's jump in stock market volatility that effectively put the fund manager out of business. 
LJM invested in complex derivatives that lost most of their value over two days in early February 2018 following the biggest-ever single-day jump in the VIX volatility index . LJM later returned what remained of clients' money.
The Chicago-based fund manager was one of the largest casualties of the spike in volatility, which wiped out several derivative-linked investments that had delivered profits in calmer markets.
The losses have prompted more than two dozen lawsuits from various traders and firms that say they lost money due to manipulation of the VIX, the widely followed ""fear gauge"" that acts as a barometer of future expected swings in the S&P 500 stock index.
In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, LJM said it wants Cboe Global Markets Inc, which owns the VIX index, to unveil the identities of parties it believes were responsible for manipulating the index and crashing the market.
Cboe, which is not a party to the lawsuit, declined comment. It has previously said it monitors markets to identify problems.
The lawsuit alleges that when the S&P 500 fell 4.1 percent on Feb. 5 last year, unnamed parties posted inflated prices for related options, boosting the VIX to benefit positions they held in VIX-linked products.
Those actions lifted the VIX and affected the price of other financial instruments that move in tandem with the options, including some traded by LJM. LJM said it was forced to trade in the instruments at artificial prices and suffered millions of dollars in losses as a result.
LJM said in the lawsuit that it had the right to obtain the identities of parties it believed to have manipulated the market from Cboe.
The fund manager filed an earlier claim blaming its VIX-related losses on the actions of its broker, a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co unit, which it said forced the unwinding of its portfolio at a disadvantageous time. 
Wells Fargo, which asked a court for help retrieving $16.4 million from LJM, denied those claims. A judge dismissed LJM's claims against Wells Fargo in September but the fund manager has asked the court to reconsider.
The case is LJM Partners Ltd v. John Does, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-cv-00368.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 09:27PM ET</span>","Exclusive: BlackRock, Goldman to move some fund managers to U.S. if no-deal Brexit - sources","By Josephine Mason, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management both plan to temporarily move some British-based fund managers to New York in the event of a no-deal Brexit, two sources told Reuters.
The portfolio managers would eventually be transferred to mainland Europe to handle client accounts there once Britain and the European Union agreed a regulatory framework, they added.
But neither of the firms, who together employ more than 10,000 people in London, expects a chaotic exit that would force them to carry out the emergency relocation, the sources said.
A spokeswoman for BlackRock, which is the world's biggest asset manager and manages around $6.3 trillion, declined to comment on the plan but in an emailed response to Reuters said:
""BlackRock maintains extensive regulatory licenses and permissions across Europe and globally to ensure it can continue to serve its clients post-Brexit.""
To avert such moves, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in talks with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on agreements which would oversee cross-border asset activity and managers.
The U.S. makes sense as a temporary base for Goldman and BlackRock as Europe has cooperation agreements with U.S. regulators, so managers could handle European clients' accounts from there until ESMA and the FCA have theirs.
""By pulling the UK out of Europe, there's potentially a regulatory hole because the UK doesn't have a cooperation and information sharing agreement with each EU country,"" said Neil Robson, regulatory partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.
An ESMA spokesman said it expects to have agreements in place before the end of March. If not, BlackRock will move around 10 equity portfolio managers to New York, one source said, adding they would later move to the euro zone.
Goldman's asset management business GSAM, with 50 managers in London, has plans to send ""a handful"" to the U.S. financial capital until a framework is in place, the second source said, adding they too would eventually relocate to the euro zone.
GSAM has picked Dublin as a center for administrative staff when it no longer has access to the single market from London following Brexit. https://reut.rs/2QUGhAr
""We continue to monitor the situation and are prepared to serve clients whatever the outcome,"" a GSAM spokesman said.
It is not known whether other big U.S. asset managers are drawing up similar plans and  State Street  (NYSE:STT), Fidelity Investments and  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) all declined to comment.
""EXTREME SCENARIO""
Although concerns about a chaotic no-deal exit have eased since the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's draft plan in Parliament on Tuesday, the contingency plans highlight efforts by money managers to avoid major disruption before the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the EU.
For BlackRock, the strategy expands on plans announced in October in which it said ""only very few"" roles would be moved from London as a result of Brexit. 
Although London-based asset managers already operate funds listed in Luxembourg and Dublin, holding more than a trillion euros of assets for customers across the bloc, they would not be able to continue operating as they do now post-Brexit.
""Until such time as the UK has that agreement in place with each of the EU 27 member states or with ESMA on behalf of all of them, UK managers would find it difficult to conduct marketing of their funds in such countries,"" Robson said.
Adam Jacobs-Dean, managing director, global head of markets regulation at the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) in London, said most of its member firms are working on the assumption that new agreements will be in place in time.

""It's an extreme scenario. Hopefully soon we'll see agreements being finalised and this falls away in terms of Brexit planning.""

The iPhone maker was banned from selling the iPhone 7 and 8 models in Germany in December following a patent dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
Qualcomm on Thursday obtained the preliminary injunction stopping Apple from using a statement that it released to the press in response to the December ruling. 
At the time, the iPhone maker said that it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany but those models would remain available to customers through more than 4,300 carriers and resellers across Germany.
""The press release ... is misleading as it contains statements that are at least potentially deceptive about the availability of the goods, namely the iPhones affected by the ruling,"" a three-judge panel wrote in the latest ruling.
The judges said Apple's press release gives consumers and retailers the false impression of unlimited availability of the phones.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Qualcomm said ""the order speaks for itself"".

The parcel company announced in December that it would be offering voluntary buyouts to ease pressure on profits that have been hit by troubles in its express delivery unit and the integration of European company TNT.
FedEx had said that the vast majority of its buyout offers would be made to workers at the FedEx Express unit, which has 227,000 employees, and at FedEx Services, which employs 30,000 people.
The company also slashed its 2019 forecast that month blaming a weakening European economy and U.S. trade tensions that exacerbated a slowdown in China.
The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said on Friday it expects to incur charges of between $450 million and $575 million related to the buyout program predominantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
It expects employees to vacate their positions by the end of fiscal 2019 and the program to save it between $225 million to $275 million annually beginning in fiscal 2020. 
FedEx did not announce how many jobs it seeks to cut, but has said previously that it would extend similar voluntary buyouts to international workers too.

FedEx employs more than 450,000 people around the world, according to its latest annual filing. The company's shares closed up 2 percent on Friday and were unchanged in after hours trading.

(Reuters) - U.S. online luxury reseller The RealReal Inc is talking to investment banks about the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The company - which specializes in online secondhand luxury apparel and goods - has sent out a request for proposals to prospective advisors and underwriters to manage the listing this year, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The RealReal declined to comment.
In July last year, The RealReal raised $115 million of private funding in a deal led by Perella Weinberg Partners, with additional participation from new investor Sandbridge Capital and existing investor Great Hill Partners. The deal valued the company at $745 million, according to data provider PitchBook.
Since then, the company, which was founded in 2011, has focused on expanding its brick-and-mortar presence with outlets in new areas and more online fulfillment centers.
The RealReal's success is built on a profitable mix of the boom in e-commerce, the millennial interest in the price and environmental benefits of recycled clothing, and the caution of established high-end brands about what selling their wares on the web can do to brand value.

Fellow e-commerce platform Farfetch (N:FTCH) went public in last September at the top of its target IPO price range, raising $885 million.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.38%. The S&P 500 added 1.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.03%.
China offered to boost annual imports of U.S. goods by a combined value of more than $1 trillion in a bid to cut its surplus with the U.S., Bloomberg reported.
The news stoked investor optimism that China and United States will resolve their differences on trade.
The months-long trade war is on ice until March 1, after which, in the absence of an agreement, the U.S. could raise duties on imports from China to 25% from 10%.
The optimism on trade added strength to industrials, which were already rising thanks to gains in trucking company JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT).
JB Hunt reported fourth-quarter earnings of 81 cents a share, well below expectations for earnings of $1.50 a share, while revenue of $2.32 billion was modestly above estimates of $2.31 billion. Its shares rose 6%.
Energy names also supported the broader market, gaining more than 1% on the back of a 3.2% surge in U.S. oil prices. The rosier outlook on trade eased concerns about slowing crude demand.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC)., owner of brands including Vans and The North Face, delivered above-consensus earnings and guidance, sending its share price more than 12% higher.
That helped ease some of the recent pain in the beaten-down retail sector, which is down 7% over the past year. Macy's (NYSE:M),  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) and L Brands (NYSE:LB) ended day higher.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Turkish Cypriots seek end to natural gas dispute,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Northern Cyprus wants to resolve a dispute over natural gas drilling with Greek Cypriots to avoid the possibility of its leading to wide instability, the breakaway state's deputy prime minister said after visits with Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers. 
""We believe this is an unfair situation ... which may put the stability of the region at risk,"" Kudret Ozersay, who is also foreign minister of Northern Cyprus, said in an interview last week. Ozersay was on his first diplomatic visit to the United States in his current position for Northern Cyprus, which only Turkey recognizes as a country. 
Cyprus is thought to have rich deposits of offshore natural gas, but the island is divided and tensions are rising about the drilling. 
Cyprus was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 that followed a Greek-inspired coup. Northern Cyprus is now a Turkish Cypriot state of about 300,000 people. 
Greek Cypriots, who run Cyprus' internationally recognized government, have licensed several offshore blocks to multinational energy companies for exploration. They have said a peace deal would allow both communities to benefit from any offshore resources, but have balked at including the issue in settlement talks. Peace talks collapsed in 2017.
Next month Greek Cypriots and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) are due to announce the results of offshore natural gas exploration. 
Ozersay said the terms of drilling are unacceptable because they allow Greek Cypriots to profit from drilling even before a settlement is reached, while Turkish Cypriots can only profit after such an agreement. There is a ""window of opportunity"" for the two sides to agree terms to drilling that are acceptable to Northern Cyprus, said Ozersay, who talked with U.S. officials to pressure for change.
Last year Cyprus accused the Turkish military of blocking the Saipem 12000 drill ship, contracted by Italian company Eni (MI:ENI) from exploring for natural gas. Turkey claimed that certain areas of Cyprus's offshore exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, fall under the jurisdiction of Turkey or that of Turkish Cypriots.
The move was noticed by Washington. Local media reported in June that Wess Mitchell, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said Washington had been clear in its messaging with Turkish officials that ""harassment of drilling vessels in the (EEZ) is not something that we will allow to go unnoticed or speak up about."" 
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting with Ozersay.
Ozersay said Northern Cyprus has cooperated with international bodies to extradite individuals listed on Interpol, the international police body, and wants to continue the efforts, a hint that the breakaway state should be recognized for its efforts. ""To the extent possible we will try to implement the rules of international law and we will be ready to cooperate with international actors and organizations,"" he said.
An expert on European energy politics said Northern Cyprus was trying to build momentum while President Donald Trump expects warmer relations with Turkey. ""Clearly the Trump administration is trying to improve relations with Turkey, thus it is logical that Northern Cyprus is trying to leverage a deal,"" said Brenda Shaffer, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's Center for Eurasian, Russia and and East European Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.
Ozersay also met with U.S. Representatives Steve Cohen and Gerald Connolly, both Democrats, and Steve Chabot and John Curtis, both Republicans. The lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment about their meetings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday as increased hopes that the United States and China would resolve their trade dispute lifted shares across sectors.
Wall Street moved higher after a Bloomberg report said China sought to raise its annual goods imports from the United States by a combined value of more than $1 trillion in order to reduce its trade surplus to zero by 2024.
The news followed a report on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. A Treasury spokesman denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation.
With Friday's gains, the three main indexes were on their way to a fourth successive weekly advance. A strong rally in January has put the benchmark S&P 500 index on track for its best monthly gain since March 2016.
The S&P 500 is now 9 percent below its Sept. 20 record close after dropping 19.8 percent below that level - near the 20-percent threshold commonly considered to confirm a bear market - on Christmas Eve.
""It's risk-on again,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""We've gotten an olive branch from China regarding trade. Obviously there's been a very positive reaction from the market.""
Even so, Ghriskey said, relatively light trading volume this week indicated that some investors were still waiting on the sidelines.
""Trade negotiations are still uncertain, despite these olive branches,"" he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 280.1 points, or 1.15 percent, to 24,650.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 29.08 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,665.04 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 57.63 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,142.09.
U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
Industrial stocks (SPLRCI) rose 1.7 percent, the most among the S&P 500's major sectors, while the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index (SOX) climbed 2.2 percent. Both groups of shares have been sensitive to trade developments.
Technology stocks (SPLRCT) were the biggest boost to the S&P 500, rising 1.2 percent, while the defensive utilities sector lagged.
Shares of Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) jumped 7.7 percent after the oilfield services provider reported quarterly revenue that beat estimates.
Shares of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), however, fell 4.1 percent after the video-streaming company forecast lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter.
Analysts have lowered their fourth-quarter earnings forecast for S&P 500 companies to 14.2 percent year-over-year growth from 20.1 percent estimated on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>",$11 toothpaste: Immigrants pay big for basics at private ICE lock-ups,"By Michelle Conlin and Kristina Cooke
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Detained in a California lockup with hundreds of other immigrants seeking asylum, Duglas Cruz faced a choice.
He could content himself with a jailhouse diet that he said left him perpetually hungry. Or he could labor in the prison's kitchen to earn money to buy extra food at the commissary.
Cruz went to work. But his $1-a-day salary at the privately run Adelanto Detention Facility did not stretch far.
A can of commissary tuna sold for $3.25. That is more than four times the price at a  Target  (NYSE:TGT) store near the small desert town of Adelanto, about two hours northeast of Los Angeles. Cruz stuck with ramen noodles at 58 cents a package, double the Target price. A miniature deodorant stick, at $3.35 and more than three days' wages, was an impossible luxury, he said.
""If I bought that there wouldn't be enough money for food,"" Cruz said.
Tuna and deodorant would seem minor worries for detainees such as Cruz. Now 25, he sought asylum after fleeing gangs trying to recruit him in his native Honduras, a place where saying ""no"" can mean execution.
But immigration attorneys say the pricey commissary goods are part of a broader strategy by private prisons to harness cheap inmate labor to lower operating costs and boost profits.
Immigrants and activists say facilities such as Adelanto, owned by Boca Raton, Fla.-based  Geo Group Inc  (N:GEO), the nation's largest for-profit corrections company, deliberately skimp on essentials, even food, to coerce detainees to labor for pennies an hour to supplement meager rations.
Geo Group spokesperson Pablo Paez called those allegations ""completely false."" He said detainees are given meals approved by dieticians, the labor program is strictly voluntary, and wage rates are federally mandated.
The company said Geo Group contracts with outside vendors to run its commissaries, whose prices ""are in line with comparable local markets."" It also said Geo Group makes a ""minimal commission"" on commissary items, most of which goes into a ""welfare fund"" to purchase recreational equipment and other items for detainees.
Relatives can send money electronically to fund their loved ones' commissary accounts, for fees that can reach as high as 10 percent of the amount deposited, some families report. But for many immigrant detainees, scrubbing toilets or mopping floors is the only way they say they can earn enough to stay clean and fed.
You “either work for a few cents an hour or live without basic things like soap, shampoo, deodorant and food,” detainee Wilhen Hill Barrientos, 67, said in a class-action lawsuit filed last year by the Southern (NYSE:SO) Poverty Law Center against Nashville-based CoreCivic Inc (N:CXW), the nation's second-largest for-profit prison operator. In the complaint, Barrientos said guards told him to ""use his fingers"" when he asked for toilet paper at the Stewart Detention Center, located in rural Lumpkin, Georgia.
Detainees are challenging what they say is an oppressive business model in which the companies deprive them of essentials to force them to work for sub-minimum wages, money that is soon recaptured in the firms' own commissaries.
""These private prison companies are profiting off of what is essentially a company-store scenario,"" said the SPLC's Meredith Stewart, a lead attorney on the class action.
Immigrant rights groups have filed similar lawsuits against CoreCivic and Geo Group in California, Colorado, Texas and Washington.
Government watchdogs and lawmakers are taking notice too.
In November, 11 U.S. senators, including 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent letters to Geo Group and CoreCivic lambasting the ""perverse profit incentive at the core of the private prison business,"" which has benefited from a crackdown on illegal immigrants under U.S. President Donald Trump.
The senators cited a December 2017 report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General documenting problems at lockups contracted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)). The inspector general found spoiled, moldy and expired food, and cited detainees' complaints that hygiene products were “not provided promptly or at all,"" the report said.
The lawmakers have demanded Geo Group and CoreCivic respond to allegations of detainee mistreatment.
Geo Group said a comprehensive, detailed response is underway. The company told Reuters that Geo Group has ""already taken steps to remedy areas where our processes fell short of our commitment to high-quality care.""
CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said the company disagrees with the senators' assertions, and that it provides ""all daily needs"" of detainees.
She said CoreCivic follows all federal standards for ICE-contracted facilities, including management of the outside vendors that run its commissaries, prices for commissary products, and fees charged to families for depositing funds into detainees' commissary accounts.
BULL MARKET IN IMMIGRANT DETENTION
The U.S. for-profit prison industry has exploded over the past two decades. In 2016, 128,300 people - roughly 1 in 12 U.S. prisoners - were incarcerated in private lock-ups. That is an increase of 47 percent from 2000, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Geo Group and CoreCivic together manage over half of U.S. private prison contracts, with combined revenues of nearly $4 billion in 2017. ICE is the No. 1 customer by revenue for both companies.
Trump's immigration polices have been a boon for the industry, which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his election and inauguration. In fiscal 2019, the number of people in ICE detention has averaged 45,200 daily, according to agency spokesman Vincent Picard. That is up nearly 19 percent from fiscal 2017.
Both Geo Group and CoreCivic have added hundreds of immigration detention beds over the past year. Stock prices for the two companies are up about 30 percent since Trump’s election.
The government pays private prison companies fees ranging from roughly $60 to $130 daily for the care and feeding of each detainee.
At CoreCivic's Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, which houses about 1,700 undocumented immigrants, ICE pays a per diem of $62.03 for each detainee housed there. CoreCivic's revenue from Stewart alone was $38 million last year, court records show.
Detainee Barrientos, the lead lawsuit plaintiff, said in court documents he worked 7 days a week at the facility in order to purchase hygiene products and phone cards to call family members in Guatemala.
Those basics can add up. Reuters viewed a copy of the center's commissary price list. It shows detainees are charged $11.02 for a 4 oz. tube of Sensodyne toothpaste, available on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for $5.20.
Dove soap priced at $2.44 at the commissary is available for just over a dollar at Target. A 2.5 oz tube of Effergrip denture cream that sells for $4.99 at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is $7.12 at the commissary.
Fees are pricey too. Vioney Gutierrez, a former detainee at Geo Group's Adelanto facility in California, said 10 percent of the money her family spent to fund her commissary account was consumed by fees.
“When my daughter put in $40, I got $36,” said Gutierrez, 37. A native of Mexico, she said she spent six months at Adelanto in 2018 after asking for asylum at a port of entry. She is currently out on bond and staying with family in Oregon while she awaits the outcome of her deportation case.
Geo Group said its inmate commissary account services are provided by a third-party vendor, and that it does not profit from those transactions.
At Adelanto, Gutierrez said it cost $1 a minute to make calls to Mexico, and even more to places further afield, prices that keep many detainees from communicating with their families.
Geo Group said ICE contracts with a third-party telecom vendor and that the company plays ""no role whatsoever in communications services.""
High commissary prices have long been a complaint of prison reformers. But for immigrant detainees, many of whom borrowed money or drained savings to reach the United States, the prices are particularly prohibitive.
Cruz, the Honduran detainee, spent eight months at Adelanto last year before an immigrant rights organization paid the $10,000 bond for his release. He is now in Texas awaiting the outcome of his case.

In his final months at Adelanto, Cruz said he resorted to bartering, trading shoes he wove out of plastic bags for ramen and cookies.

The unit is aimed at lessening the company's dependence on state water utility company Cesan and avoiding production cuts at times of water crises as the state suffered in 2015 and 2016, said Jorge Ribeiro, president of operations at ArcelorMittal's Brazilian flat steel division.
While the plant is ArcelorMittal's first, desalination facilities have already become fixtures at some rival steelmakers and multiple mining operations, which tend to be water-intensive.
The company is in the final stages of picking a firm to build the plant, Ribeiro said, adding that the decision will likely be taken next month, with companies from India, the United States and Spain among those interested.
The planned investment is about 50 million reais ($13.32 million) and the project should start operating in two years, he said.
In an initial module, the plant will be capable of desalinating 500 cubic meters (132,100 gallons)of sea water per hour.
""It's a modular process, more modules can be added in the future,"" said Ribeiro.
ArcelorMittal Brazil's chief executive, Benjamin Baptista Filho, noted that during the 2015 water crisis in Espírito Santo, the company was told by the state government to reduce its consumption from Cesan by 30 percent.
""What we are doing is insurance, because if there is another rationing event, we can respond ... If there is another rationing, without the desalination, we would have to stop some of the production,"" said Filho.
According to Filho, the desalination plant will be the first in Brazil to operate exclusively with seawater. The plant will use reverse osmosis technology and consume electricity produced by the steel mill itself.

This time, their greatest hits were more of the heavy metal variety.
Prompted by the government shutdown, the SEC workers -- who moonlight in a band called G.O.A.T. Rodeo -- played a concert for fellow furlough victims. The plan was to raise some money for a charitable fund that helps federal employees and blow off some pressure that’s been building over the past month.
“We’ve been going a little crazy around my house, stir crazy, not working,’’ said Stacy Puente, an SEC attorney, before she launched into Ozzy Osbourne’s hit “Crazy Train.”
The crowd, many of whom were also missing paychecks and unable to go to their jobs at the SEC and other agencies, nodded their heads and pumped fists in the air. The band, which included Puente on vocals and SEC colleagues on lead guitar, keyboards and drums, was clearly enjoying the night out as well. One of the non-SEC members, Pulitzer-prize winning Washington Post editorial cartoonist Tom Toles, even donned a set of faux horns.
“We were a little bored,’’ said drummer Reid Muoio, an SEC enforcement lawyer who has grown his hair long since gaining prominence for his role in the agency’s post-crisis investigation of Goldman’s marketing of collateralized debt obligations. The bank settled in 2010, paying $550 million.
The concert was billed as “Fed Up!’’ and tickets were free for those with a government ID. Everyone else paid $15. The drink of choice was Pabst Blue Ribbon in tall cans.
Not in evidence: workers who President Donald Trump keeps saying are supportive of keeping much of the government closed until he gets some $5.7 billion for his border wall.
The band sent its own not-so-subtle messages with a set list of well-known cover tunes, which included “Highway to Hell’’ by AC/DC and Radiohead’s “Creep,’’ dedicated to Trump, and Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall.’’ For the final two songs, they were joined by a number of children wearing t-shirts that read “Mother Should I Trust the Government.’’
In an interview after the show, Puente said she was anxious to get back to her job, where some of her duties have included helping write a new conflict of interest rule for the brokerage industry. The SEC’s work, she noted, is important to millions of Americans and their savings.
“The retail investing public needs to feel like there is someone watching the markets,’’ she said.

House Democrats, now back in the majority, are expected to feud frequently with President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress, and Waters has said she plans to vigorously monitor his administration. 
But in the early days of the committee, Waters is emphasizing her bipartisan efforts.
The new bill targets so-called 10b5-1 trading plans, which allow for executives to make prearranged sales of company stock without facing accusations of insider trading. The SEC established rules in 2000 creating such plans.
Some experts have questioned, however, whether such plans are sufficiently disclosed and could still carry insider trading risk, given that executives can make later changes to those sale plans.
The SEC said it was reviewing such plans in 2007, but has not altered its rule. The new bill would direct the SEC to study its regulation, and consider if it should place additional limits on permissible trading. 
New changes could include mandatory delays between creating a trading plan and selling shares, limiting how often executives can change those plans or limiting the number of such plans an executive can have.

The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>","Lilly cancer drug fails key trial, will no longer be prescribed","By Ankur Banerjee and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co said on Friday that its cancer treatment Lartruvo, which had won conditional approval, failed to improve patient survival in a long-term confirmatory study and will no longer be prescribed, driving the drugmaker's shares down nearly 3 percent.
No new U.S. patients will be started on the drug and Lilly is suspending promotion of the medicine, the company said. 
Lartruvo won accelerated approval in 2016 in the United States and conditional approval in Europe based on results from a promising mid-stage trial. But its continued approval was contingent on the results of a larger, late-stage trial confirming the drug's benefits.
On Friday, Lilly said Lartruvo combined with the standard-of-care chemotherapy doxorubicin did not prolong survival more than doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
Lilly oncology chief Anne White said in a phone interview the results were ""completely unexpected.""
The disappointing outcome reflects the risk involved when drugs are approved based on smaller trials with promising data.
""In a sense, this is the way it's supposed to work,"" White said. ""You do that confirmatory study. Obviously, there are times when it doesn't work out.""
Lartruvo will continue to be available to patients who appear to be benefiting from it as global regulators determine the next steps for the treatment, White said.
The Lartruvo news is a major setback to Lilly's efforts to significantly boost its presence in oncology, as evidenced by its announcement last week that it would buy Loxo Oncology Inc for $8 billion to acquire its cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations.
Analysts had forecast 2019 Lartruvo sales of $374.50 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Lilly in the past had avoided large deals, preferring to develop its own drugs. But the Loxo deal, the biggest acquisition in Lilly's 143-year history, followed last year's $1.6 billion purchase of Armo Biosciences, a developer of immunotherapy drugs. 
""Given Lilly's strategic focus on oncology, this increases the probability that Lilly will make more oncology acquisitions to improve scale,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said of the Lartruvo setback in a research note.
Lilly expects to take a first-quarter pretax charge of $70 million to $90 million, or about 10 cents per share, after tax, and said the setback will cut about 17 cents per share from its full-year 2019 earnings forecast.
The company does not see a change in its 2020 minimum financial goals.

Eli Lilly shares were down 2.8 percent at $115.81 afternoon trading.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",Leasing firm seeks earlier return of 10 Avianca Brasil planes,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Aircastle Ltd  (N:AYR) will try to repossess 10 planes from Avianca Brasil before the Feb. 1 expiration of a 15-day stay on repossessions from the struggling airline, a representative of the U.S.-based aircraft leasing firm said on Friday. 
Aircastle is the second lessor to seek an earlier return of the planes after Avianca Brasil, which filed for bankruptcy in December, obtained the 15-day stay on any repossessions of its planes in a court hearing on Monday.
Brazil's aviation regulator said on Thursday it would seek to ground a separate group of 10 planes at the request of a different leasing company,  General Electric  Co (N:GE) unit GECAS. 
Aircastle and GECAS own a combined 40 percent of the carrier's 46-plane fleet, and the loss of those aircraft could affect tens of thousands of passengers. 
Aircastle's move creates further uncertainty about Avianca Brasil's ability to maintain its current flight schedule. The carrier has said it is operating normally, although it has also said it will give back some planes and scale back operations.
Avianca Brasil filed for bankruptcy after falling behind on lease payments, setting off a scramble to repossess its planes. 
The 15-day stay on repossessions was requested by the bankruptcy judge after the airline and its lessors failed to reach an agreement at the hearing on Monday, according to the legal order, which the lessors signed.
It specifically states that the leasing firms did not agree with the judge’s decision, Aircastle said in a statement. 

""His decision is completely contrary to the Cape Town Convention,"" Aircastle said, referring to a little-known international treaty that allows for swift repossession of aircraft. Brazil and the United States are among the countries that have signed the treaty.

420,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:38PM ET</span>",Solid Base,"Crude oil is getting a boost on trade deal hopes as well as a week of optimism that global central banks are ready to be more accommodative writes Phil Flynn Senior Energy Analyst The PRICE Futures Group. 
Crude oil is getting a boost on trade deal hopes as well as a week of optimism that global central banks are ready to be more accommodative to support economic growth. For crude that is very supportive because despite of all the talk of a reaction, oil demand has not seen any significant decline. That of course means that OPEC is already complying with production cuts ahead of schedule even if we see the Russians are moving slowly, like Russia always does. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA), own data doesn’t seem to support their thesis of a long slog to market balance. And while we still have some resistance above before crude breaks out, the trading in this range suggest that the longer we consolidate the bigger the ultimate upside price move.
Crude oil was bouncing off support stuck in a range, but turned decidedly higher on a Wall Street Journal report that “U.S. officials are debating ratcheting back tariffs on Chinese imports to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions in a trade battle that has rattled global economies. The idea of lifting some or all tariffs was proposed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a series of strategy meetings, according to people close to internal deliberations. They say the aim is to advance trade talks and win China’s support for longer-term reforms. But Mnuchin faces resistance from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is concerned that any concession could be a sign of weakness.”
Yet denials from the White House about the story caused a pause in the market enthusiasm, yet the market is tending to believe it because it would make too much sense. President Trump wants a deal and the Chinese have already made some concessions, buying U.S. grains and crude oil for example and the desire to get this done soon would be in everybody’s interest.
It is in Saudi Arabia’s interest to get crude back to $80 per barrel. Reports confirm what we have been hearing that Saudi Arabia cut production by more than expected, according to independent data. The IEA says that while Saudi Arabia is determined to protect its price aspirations by delivering substantial production cuts, there is less clarity with regard to its Russian partner. Data shows that Russia increased crude oil production in December to a new record near 11.5 million barrels-per-day and it is unclear when it will cut and by how much. Other non-OPEC countries joining in the output deal saw higher output, including Mexico. U.S. oil production growth combined with a slowing global economy will put oil prices under downward pressure in 2019, challenging OPEC’s resolve to support the market with output cuts.
Yet at the same time, the IEA had to admit that its estimate for oil demand growth for this year is unchanged at 1.4 million barrels per day, close to 2018 levels. The reason they say is because “The impact of higher oil prices in 2018 is fading, which will help offset lower economic growth.” Yet this agency is famous for underestimating and if that growth exceeds this number, global supply based off of their own data would suggest a risk of a major tightening of global oil supply.
Yet the IEA says there are signs that market re-balancing will be gradual. They say the trajectory of Iran’s production and exports remains important. In December, total exports increased slightly to more than 1.3 million barrels-per-day. With U.S. waivers allowing Iran’s major customers to buy higher volumes than was previously thought, more oil will remain in the market in the early part of 2019.
Venezuela has seen the collapse of its oil industry slow during the second half of 2018 with production falling recently each month at a slower pace. The level of output in the world’s biggest liquids producer, the United States, will once again be a major factor in 2019.
We saw incredible and unexpected growth in total liquids production. For this year, we have left unchanged for now our forecast for growth. While the other two giants voluntarily cut output, the United States, already the biggest liquids supplier will reinforce its leadership as the world’s number one crude producer. By the middle of the year, U.S. crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either Saudi Arabia or Russia. 
For oil demand, there is a mixed picture. Falling prices in Q4 2018 helped consumers and there are signs that trade tensions might be easing. In many developing countries, lower international oil prices coincide with a weaker dollar as the likelihood of higher U.S. interest rates fades for now. However, the mood music in the global economy is not very cheerful. Confidence is weakening in several major economies.
In the meantime, refiners face a challenging year. Processing capacity will increase by 2.6 million barrels-per-day, the biggest growth for four decades, while margins are already pressured by low gasoline cracks due to oversupply and weak demand. The well-trailed changes to the International Maritime Organization’s marine fuel regulations due in 2020 are another big issue for some refiners as they seek to find outlets for unwanted high-sulphur fuel oil.
By the end of the year, all industry players, upstream and downstream, may feel as if they have run a marathon."

E-mini S&P (ESH)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at 2635.25, up 22.00
Fundamentals: We called this market exhausted at our major three-star resistance at 2603-2609.50 and said we were comfortable to see our two overhead resistance levels at 2624-2626 and 2631-2633 get tested. Through our exhausted narrative we have been keen to point out two types of market participants who could each be catalysts in higher price action. First, the many shorts who are trapped from 2500 and lower. The second being under-positioned portfolio managers. A short covering pop was inevitable, hence our comfort above major three-star resistance. Yelling fire in a crowded movie theatre has a negative connotation. However, the same theory applies when you have shorts who must cover and under-positioned portfolio managers with FOMO (fear of missing out) who feel their job is on the line.
Yesterday’s news that the U.S is weighing lifting the tariffs on China is exactly that. The Treasury department and the U.S Trade Representative’s office denied reports that the U.S was going to give-in, but the damage has already been done, fire has already been shouted and the theatre has already been emptied. Listen, we understand that many times when there is smoke, there is fire. But the question is whether this is true substance ahead of the meeting between the U.S and China later this month or is it the latest attempt at jawboning?
The government shutdown heads into its fifth week. This has slimmed out the economic calendar a bit but today brings a full dose. New York Fed President Williams (NYSE:WMB) speaks at 8:00 am CT. Industrial Production is due at 8:15 am CT. Michigan Consumer data is expected to dip due to the shutdown and will be closely watched at 9:00 am CT, it is the freshest data point released each month. At 10:00 am CT, Philadelphia Fed President Harker speaks.
Crude Oil (CLH)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $52.36, down 25¢
Fundamentals: The IEA released their monthly report this morning and said they expect U.S production growth coupled with a slowing global economy to put downward pressure on Crude Oil in 2019. They did note that the impact of higher prices on demand has begun to dissipate. Therefore, they kept demand growth unchanged despite their expectations for the global economy to slow.
Prices were under pressure early yesterday on reports that showed reinvigorating tensions between the U.S and China on trade after lawmakers wanted to introduce a bill that would ban the sale of chips to Chinese companies that violated export laws. However, the tables were turned late in the afternoon after it was reported the U.S is weighing lifting the tariffs on China. Although these reports were denied, this has provided a strong tailwind to risk sentiment. This was so for Crude Oil as it coupled with the OPEC Monthly report that showed a drop in OPEC production of 751,000 bpd in December. For now, OPEC’s jawboning coupled with trade tailwinds has drowned out a growing composite of inventories domestically.
Gold (GCG)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $1,292.30, down $1.50
Fundamentals: Gold has slipped by nearly 1%. This began after midnight as global equity markets are responding to yesterday’s reports that the U.S is weighing lifting the tariffs on China; less demand for safe-havens. Gold and the Chinese Yuan have both recovered firmly since October which means that positive news on trade does not have the same impact in the past given that there is nothing for them to price-in anymore. NY Fed President Williams said this morning reiterated patience and data dependence. He noted that uncertainties have risen, the lack of data due to the shutdown and that it could also affect consumer spending. Industrial Production beat expectations this morning which added pressures to the metal. Michigan Consumer data will be crucial at 9:00 am CT and Philadelphia Fed President Harker speaks at 10:00 am CT."
422,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:38PM ET</span>",Invesco Coming Under Technical Pressure,"“IVZ has rallied more than 15% since its Christmas Eve closing low of $15.71, … [and] now finds itself staring up at a formidable layer of trendline resistance,” writes Elizabeth Harrow.
Investment management stock Invesco (IVZ) has been underperforming technically for quite a while. The shares have given up 52.5% of their value over the past 52 weeks, seriously lagging the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX) — which is off 6.4% for this time frame. And while IVZ has rallied more than 15% since its Christmas Eve closing low of $15.71, which was its lowest daily finish since the fourth quarter of 2011, the stock now finds itself staring up at a formidable layer of trendline resistance.
Specifically, IVZ has now run headlong into its 40-day moving average (see chart below). This trendline has guided the stock steadily lower over the past year, and stubbornly rejected a number of rally attempts along the way. Looking at the past seven times IVZ has tested resistance at its 40-day, Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White found that Invesco's average 21-day return was -6.86%, with only one of those occurrence producing a positive return.
With the company set to report fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Jan. 30, there's some additional event risk baked into IVZ's short-term outlook. Over the past eight quarters, Trade-Alert data shows that IVZ has closed lower five times the day after earnings— and the average negative post-earnings move has been 3.06%, more than doubling the average positive post-earnings price change of 1.5%.
In the one-month stretch from mid-November to mid-December, short sellers were eager to take profits on IVZ. Over this four-week period, the number of shares sold short collapsed by 32% from the Nov. 15 peak of 19.43 million— but in the most recent reporting period, short interest ticked higher once again, rising by 1.5% to account for 3.3% of the stock's float. As short sellers re-assert their presence on this beaten-down stock, the resulting selling pressure should push IVZ even lower.
There's ample room for downgrades to accelerate IVZ's bearish momentum. Among the 13 analysts tracking the stock, not one calls it a ""sell,"" and four maintain ""strong buy"" ratings. Any negative notes from this group could spark fresh downside.
Meanwhile, despite the upcoming earnings event, short-term options on IVZ aren't too unreasonably priced. The equity's 30-day at-the-money implied volatility checks in at 34.6%, which registers in the 82nd annual percentile. This reading is still far removed from the Dec. 24 52-week high of 55.7%, as near-term volatility expectations have cooled over the past few weeks. In fact, February-dated options are priced right near the middle of their annual range, for those looking to bet on IVZ's latest 40-day sell signal via the purchase of short-term puts."
423,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:38PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Road Map for 2019,"“You don’t unwind a multi-year bubble …with a couple of 10% corrections,” warns Mike Larson, who expects a major decline later this year. Hear his market outlook at the MoneyShow Orlando Feb. 9.
I’m a sucker for a good road trip. Credit my parents, who took my brother and I on a pair of “Griswold Family vacations” as children – two, multi-week car trips to various national parks and other landmarks during the 1980s.
Back then, there was no Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps to help you find your way around. No Instagram for you to upload your vacation selfies to. Just a Rand McNally road atlas – and lots of film to develop when you got home.
As a modern investor in this market, though, a road map is exactly what you need. It will keep you from throwing up your hands, declaring you’re lost, and heading home to the safety of cash.
Start with the big picture. The chart below shows the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY (NYSE:SPY)) going back to the beginning of 2016. You can see the market’s initial surge in January 2018, the renewed push higher in September 2018, the subsequent collapse in December and the bounce earlier this month.
What’s noteworthy from a technical standpoint here?
First, the SPY clearly broke down out of a topping pattern that persisted for most of 2018. The support zone marked by the two black, horizontal lines gave way in December. Now, that has become a zone of overhead resistance.
Second, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD technical indicators are confirming the market’s underlying weakness. Our own Weiss Ratings BUY/SELL ratio has been doing the same for a year now.
Third, we’ve seen a dreaded “death cross” in the SPY. That’s when the 50-day moving average plunges down through the 200-day moving average.
That last happened in August 2015, and it led to a period of market choppiness and turmoil that persisted for a year. Before that, you have to go back to August 2011 during the government debt ceiling debacle to find another bearish cross. Several months of volatility followed.
The difference between then and now is simple: We’re much farther along in the economic, interest rate, and credit cycles. In fact, I would argue we’ve already reached a tipping point in all of them – one that makes this death cross much more significant from a long-term perspective than the previous ones.
Bottom line: This technical action looks, trades and acts like the start of third bear market of the new millennium.
Of course, that doesn’t mean you won’t see sharp rallies. The chart below tells you everything you need to know. It shows the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 2007 through 2009.
Each of the red arrows represents either a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, a government-organized bailout or an “alphabet soup” rescue program designed to prop up credit markets.
As you can see, almost all of them sparked short-term rallies. And as you can also see, all of those rallies subsequently failed until the excesses of the bull market and housing bubble were wrung out.
My atlas therefore suggests the current rally could last for a little while longer and extend a bit further. The S&P 500 could even trade as high as the mid-2600s.
But that strength won’t last. We’ll see a pullback, and likely a retest or near-retest of the December lows. That will be followed by one last-gasp bounce.
Then when the largely sideways chop ends in a few months, things get serious. The bear market resumes, and ultimately, that move sends us to much lower levels. After all, you don’t unwind a multi-year bubble — one encouraged and underwritten by the easiest monetary policy in all of recorded history — with a couple of 10% corrections.
So, my advice is as follows: Use this period of relative calm to get your portfolio in order. Lighten up on vulnerable stocks into the rally, and add downside hedges like inverse ETFs while they’re cheap.
Also, boost your gold and gold mining share allocation as a play on increasing volatility. Then buckle up and get ready for a much more challenging market later in 2019."

434,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>",Tesla cuts jobs as it looks to make Model 3 more affordable,"By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Friday it would cut thousands of jobs to rein in costs as it plans to increase production of lower-priced versions of its crucial Model 3 sedan, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent.
The company, which has struggled to achieve long-term profitability and keep a tight lid on expenses, also said it expects fourth-quarter profit to be lower than the preceding quarter.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the need for lower-priced versions of Model 3 will become even greater from July, when the U.S. tax credit again drops in half, adding $1,875 to the car's price tag, and again at the end of the year when it goes away entirely. 
The phase-out of the electric vehicle tax break confronts Tesla with the choice of raising prices at the risk of losing customers or slashing costs by thousands of dollars per vehicle, a herculean task for an automaker.
Musk also faces a narrowing window in which his electric luxury vehicles enjoy a monopoly in the segment that Tesla created and defined. Over the next several years, established automakers plan to spend nearly $300 billion on electric vehicles and batteries. 
Legacy luxury brands such as Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi and Porsche, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW all plan new luxury electric vehicles. 
Chinese startups such as Byton and NIO are pushing ahead with technically advanced electric vehicles, building on China's aggressive support for cleaner cars. Most analysts expect China will be the world's largest electric vehicle market. 
Musk said on Friday the company would need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 version in all markets starting around May, as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles.
Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, said she expected the year to be challenging for all automakers as new vehicle sales slow.
""It will be especially challenging for Tesla as it desperately tries to rack up more quarterly profits after having one in the third quarter, and it faces an onslaught of competitors in the next couple of years,"" she said.
The billionaire entrepreneur has been under intense pressure to stabilize production of the Model 3, a car that was unveiled in early 2016 to great fanfare and is seen critical to the company's long-term viability.
But Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016, and Musk said last year that Tesla had moved from ""production hell to delivery logistics hell.""
This is Tesla's second job cut in seven months and comes just days after it cut U.S. prices for all vehicles and fell short on quarterly deliveries of its mass-market Model 3 sedan.
In a memo to employees on Friday, Musk said 2018 was the ""most challenging in Tesla's history,"" adding the company hired 30 percent more employees last year which was more than it could support.
""I want to make sure that you know all the facts and figures and understand that the road ahead is very difficult,"" Musk said.
""There isn't any other way.""
Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount.
The company reported a profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, which Musk called Tesla's ""first meaningful profit"" since the company started.
For the fourth quarter, analysts on average expect the company's net income to be $216.92 million on a reported basis. The estimate shrinks further in first quarter to $62.80 million, according to Refinitiv data.
""This quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,"" Musk said.
Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to meet, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make the company profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in its 15-year existence.
The electric carmaker said on Friday it would reduce full-time employee headcount by about 7 percent and retain only the most critical temps and contractors.

In June, Tesla said it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce. Musk had tweeted in October that the company employed 45,000 people. (https://

441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Investors punish poorly performing hedge funds by pulling billions,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge funds suffered their worst quarterly outflows in two years when investors pulled $23 billion from the industry during the last three months of 2018, new data released on Friday show.
In total, investors asked for $34 billion back last year, but the bulk of the money was pulled out in the fourth quarter when investors lost patience with poor returns and a number of firms decided to shut down after lackluster performance.
Fourth quarter redemptions marked the largest quarterly outflows since the third quarter of 2016 when investors pulled $28.2 billion, Hedge Fund Research data showed.
The outflows shrunk the size of the hedge fund industry to $3.1 trillion from a record $3.24 trillion at the end of the third quarter.
A number of prominent firms shut last year, including Boston-based Highfields Capital and Three Bays Capital, which was founded by a former Highfields executive. In New York, Tourbillon Capital announced plans to shut down, and San Francisco-based Criterion Capital Management said it was closing.
Investors pulled the most money out of stock picking funds, asking for $16.8 billion back in the last three months. So-called equity hedge funds also posted the worst performance, losing roughly 7 percent last year.

David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, for example, lost 34 percent, marking his worst-ever year, and Larry Robbins' Glenview Capital Management lost 16.2 percent.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 11:04AM ET</span>",Netflix shares fall as weak forecast dampens investor optimism,"(Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell nearly 5 percent on Friday, as investors looked past its record subscriber numbers and instead focused on its lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the first quarter.
The video streaming pioneer's shortfall in revenue expectations disappointed investors looking for a bigger payoff from the company's recent decision to raise prices as much as 18 percent for its U.S. customers. 
""Many investors we spoke with in recent days expected the price increase to flow through to improved free cash flow guide. That didn't happen,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to clients.
Even so, Netflix remains the best performing FAANG stock this year with more than a 30 percent surge. Its shares recently traded at about 83 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. Stocks trading at high earnings multiples are more prone to sell off if growth targets are missed.
While investors seemed a bit disappointed, Wall Street analysts remained unfazed by the shortfall in the company's forecast.
At least 14 analysts raised their price targets, with RBC Capital Markets pushing its estimate by $30 to $480, well past the stock's median target of $410.
""Netflix offers a truly compelling value proposition with global appeal,"" analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.
""(The company) still only accounts for perhaps 10 percent of all TV viewing hours in the U.S. This is growth defined, in our view.""
Netflix has seen blistering growth in the past few years and has bet heavily on international subscriber additions, spending billions of dollars to bolster its original content.
It boasts of award-winning shows such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Wild Wild Country"" that has helped it fend off intensifying competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's Prime Video service and Hulu. The company reported 139 million paid customers at the end of December.
But that growth has come at the cost of a rising debt pile - its long-term debt at the end of 2018 rose to a staggering $10.36 billion from $3.36 billion in 2016.
Wedbush analysts, however, said that if ""Netflix is able to improve its free cash flow by $1 billion per year, it will see its debt peak at $13 billion, and will be debt free in 2026"".
The company said it expects free cash flow in 2019 to be similar to 2018, but sees improvement each year thereafter.
""Judging by recent moves, the rest of the media industry is more than happy to sell Netflix whatever they want as long as the bid is high enough and the check clears,"" MoffettNathanson analysts said.

Shares of the company fell as much as 4.6 percent to $336.73 in early trading and were on track for its worst day in 2019.

(Reuters) - Casual dining chain Luby's Inc (N:LUB) will shake up its board, it said on Friday, just one week before shareholders vote on whether to add an investor activist's representatives as directors.
The company, which is facing pressure from Bandera Capital, a New York hedge fund that owns nearly 10 percent of its shares, will invite two new independent directors to replace two sitting members and will choose a new chair. 
""Luby's has recently been engaged in in-depth discussions with many of our shareholders, and based on the feedback we have received, we have chosen to accelerate our plans to transform the Board,"" board chairman Gasper Mir III, said in a statement.
Mir plans to give up his role as chair but stay on the board.
At Luby's Jan. 25 annual meeting shareholders will decide whether to put Bandera's nominees, which include the hedge fund's founder and his father, Philip, a former U.S. Senator from Texas, on the board.
Bandera has criticized the chain's high expenses, and investors are unhappy as its share price has tumbled 42 percent in the last year and traded at $1.60 on Friday morning.
Bandera, run by Jeff Gramm, is urging other investors to back it in demanding more accountability and oversight by the nine-member board.
Proxy advisory firm ISS recommended electing Gramm and his father to the board while another advisory firm, Glass Lewis, recommended adding only Jeff Gramm. Bandera is urging investors to add four newcomers.
Luby's operates 142 restaurants nationally, including 82 Luby's Cafeterias, 59 Fuddruckers, and 1 Cheeseburger in Paradise.

The companies did not provide financial terms of the new contract.
On Tuesday, CVS said the companies had failed to agree on pricing and that Walmart was leaving the pharmacy network for prescription drug plans that CVS manages for companies and health insurers and for the government-run Medicaid program for low-income people.
Walmart and CVS also said on Tuesday they were still in discussions. 
CVS shares gained 1.6 percent to $64.76 in premarket trading, recouping some of the stock's losses on Tuesday. 
""We view the agreement positively for CVS,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said in a research note, explaining that the loss of Walmart pharmacies could have negatively impacted CVS' ability to sign up customers for its 2020 prescription drug plans.
Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the speed at which the dispute was resolved likely points to the negotiating strength of pharmacy benefit managers in contract discussions. Consumers historically move to where their insurance is accepted, and Walmart likely would have lost out on the estimated 15 million to 20 million prescriptions it receives from CVS customers, Muken said.
In 2012, Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA) and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), now part of  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), failed to come to contract terms. Walgreens sales fell as it stopped filling prescriptions for Express Scripts customers, and the two companies reached a new agreement in the middle of the year that put Walgreens back in its network.
In addition to its retail pharmacies and stores, CVS is one of the country's biggest pharmacy benefit managers and, after buying Aetna (NYSE:AET), one of its top health insurance companies. Its prescription plans for those on the government-run Medicare program were unaffected by the contract dispute as was its Sam's Club agreements.

Sean Slovenski, a Walmart senior vice president, described the terms as ""fair and equitable"" in a press release.

(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) on Friday reported quarterly revenue that topped estimates and forecast single-digit growth in international markets this year even as crude prices have tumbled roughly 30 percent since October. 
With the drop in oil prices many producers were evaluating spending budgets for 2019, stoking concerns that a slowdown in activity would hurt oilfield service companies that have struggled to boost prices since the 2014 downturn. 
Schlumberger, a bellwether for the oilfield services sector, said recent volatility in crude prices has led to more uncertainty in the spending outlook for oil and gas producers. 
""Future investments will likely be much closer to a level that can be covered by free cash flow,"" Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said about its U.S. operator customers. He reassured investors that even as operators tighten their purse strings, the company had built 'significant flexibility' into its 2019 operating plan. 
Revenue from Schlumberger's North America business rose 0.3 percent year over year to $2.82 billion, while international revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $5.28 billion.
Schlumberger warned in early December that fourth-quarter North America revenues would take a hit due to steeper-than-anticipated declines in the hydraulic fracturing market.
Revenues in its OneStim hydraulic fracturing businesses slid 25 percent sequentially in the fourth quarter, prompting the company to idle some of its fleets late in the fourth quarter, the company said. 
Shares of Schlumberger rose 3 percent to $42.60 in trading before the opening bell.
Kibsgaard said supply cuts by OPEC and Russia could lead to a gradual recovery in oil prices in 2019.
Schlumberger reported fourth-quarter net income of $538 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.26 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 36 cents per share, in line with analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Revenue was flat at $8.18 billion, compared with a year earlier, but beat the average analyst estimate of $8.04 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Two of America’s best-known green investors are reassessing their stakes in global insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co after a Reuters investigation into the company’s lucrative side-business in “clean coal”.
A.J. Gallagher (N:AJG) has invested in 34 facilities producing so-called refined coal, which is chemically treated to make it burn cleaner and heavily subsidized by the U.S. government. The firm also holds a 46.5 percent stake in Chem-Mod LLC, which provides the chemicals used to produce the fuel. 
A.J. Gallagher has accumulated about $850 million worth of U.S. government tax credits from the business. But many utilities burning the coal have pumped out more smog, not less, over the past decade, and the chemicals have contributed to elevated carcinogens in downstream drinking water supplied to more than 1 million people, according to the Reuters Special Report.
Now, the Green Century Funds and Calvert Funds - which include A.J. Gallagher in their portfolios based on its record as an insurance firm, not a coal supplier - said they will review the company’s green credentials. Green Century and Calvert are two of nation's leading money managers focused on corporate environmental, social and governance matters. 
The idea behind the strategy is to help investors sidestep companies whose activities they find objectionable, such as polluting the environment. 
“In light of this new information, we certainly will … press the company to stop profiting from schemes devised by the fossil fuel industry to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers,” Green Century said in a statement, calling clean coal “a myth”.
A.J. Gallagher is one of about 360 companies in the $250 million Green Century Equity Fund , which advertises itself as “100% percent fossil fuel free.”
The fund, which held 4,394 A.J. Gallagher shares at the end of October, is passively managed and invests in the companies that are in an index run by  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI).
MSCI declined to comment for this story.
Calvert Research and Management, a unit of  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp, said it has contacted A.J. Gallagher as part of a reassessment of the company’s ESG performance. A.J. Gallagher is a holding in the $1.3 billion Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (O:CISIX).
“In response to this new information, we have contacted the company and will consider this information in our assessment of ESG performance,” Calvert said in a statement, referring to the Reuters reporting. 
The Calvert fund has built its own index, drawing from the 1,000 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies based on market capitalization. From there, using its own principles for responsible investment, that list had been narrowed to about 720 companies, including A.J. Gallagher.
A.J. Gallagher did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Assets in portfolios that use various ESG-related criteria have grown to about $23 trillion globally, an increase of more than 600 percent over the past decade, fund research firm Morningstar Inc said in a 2018 report.
Shares of A.J. Gallagher are held in at least ten other mutual funds that screen companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, including ones run by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group.
The company’s broad inclusion highlights the lack of clear criteria for how companies’ environmental credentials are vetted in this fast-growing green investment sector, said Vanguard spokesman John Woerth.
“There is no universally-accepted definition of ESG,” he said in a statement to Reuters.
The $4.4 billion Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund (O:VFTSX) holds an investment in A.J. Gallagher. But Vanguard does not pick the companies in the index fund it offers to investors, Woerth said. That job is done by index providers such as MSCI, or in Vanguard's case, FTSE Russell. 
“Index funds are beholden to the benchmarks they track,"" he said. ""While we engage with index providers to understand their methodologies, it is our view that index providers are independent and should have complete autonomy when constructing an index and assembling its constituents.”
Jill Davies, a town board member for Woodstock, Vermont - which has endowment money invested in the Vanguard fund - said she was disappointed by the company’s inclusion.
A.J. Gallagher’s “activities in coal don’t seem to align with the social responsibility concept behind this Vanguard fund,” she said. 
FTSE Russell said it was working to improve its ESG screening methods. 
“This is especially relevant in a rapidly expanding area like ESG,” FTSE spokesman Tim Benedict said in a statement.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:53AM ET</span>",Elliott-target Pernod pledges to further improve governance,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the family-backed French spirits group under pressure from activist investor Elliott, will continue to improve its governance, it pledged on Friday. 
The statement to Reuters followed news reports the company was likely to make board changes, a move Jefferies analysts said would be an ""early win"" for Elliott. Pernod is due to hold a board meeting on Jan. 23.
Elliott, which has become more active in Europe in recent years, said in December it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) to build a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod. Elliott has called on Pernod to raise profit margins and improve governance.
In particular, it believes Pernod's 14-member board needs to be more diverse and have more independent voices, as many directors are linked to the Ricard family. Elliott does not have a board seat.
So far, the two camps have described contacts, including one on Jan. 15, as cordial and constructive.
A Pernod spokesman said on Friday that while ""we have not needed any external input as regards our continuous drive to seek to improve our governance,... we will continue, at the appropriate moment, to announce further changes, once they have been proposed, discussed and adopted by the board and its committee."" 
On Thursday, BFM Business reported that Pernod, which owns Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, planned to reshuffle its board in the coming weeks, with vice-chairman and former Pernod CEO Pierre Pringuet among those who could step down.
Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard, who has already hired three independent directors and beefed up board expertise, is expected to present his new three-year strategy later this year, though some analysts expect Pernod to give some direction on margins alongside first-half earnings on Feb. 7.
There are, however, doubts that Elliott can change much as the Ricard family controls 15 percent of Pernod's shares and 21 percent of voting rights, while long-time investor GBL owns a 7.5 percent stake and has said its supports the firm's strategy.

One unknown is why Elliott is so far taking a less confrontational approach with Pernod than with some other investments. 
Sources familiar with the activist's thinking say Elliott could be testing a new template for negotiations with other French companies.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>","Stocks bask in trade optimism, set for fourth straight week of gains","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks jumped to their highest in more than a month on Friday after a report suggested progress toward resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up about 0.2 percent and Dow futures were up about 0.3 percent, indicating a higher open on Wall Street.
European stocks surged to their highest since early December, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up over 1 percent by afternoon trade in London. 
Trade-exposed indexes and stocks gained the most, with autos (SXAP) rising nearly 2 percent and Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) up 1.5 percent.
The gains followed the lead of stocks in Asia overnight, which in turn took their cue from Wall Street's performance on Thursday. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30.
U.S. stocks rallied on the report but pared some of the gains after the Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. The Journal also reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer resisted Mnuchin's idea.
""Even though the Treasury quickly denied the report, markets didn't retrace much, which implies that traders believe the news are credible – or at least that the overall negotiating process is moving in the right direction,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at online broker XM.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added 0.75 percent. The index has gained 1.5 percent this week. The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) was up 1.4 percent.
Australian stocks (AXJO) rose half a percent, South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) advanced 0.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained more than 1 percent to a one-month high.
The gains across regions helped lift the MSCI All-Country World Index to its highest in more than a month (MIWD00000PUS). The index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was set for its fourth straight weekly gain, its longest weekly winning streak in six months. It was last up almost half a percent.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the latest round of trade talks aimed at resolving the dispute between the world's two largest economies.
Indicators released recently showed signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum.
A report due on Monday is expected to show China's fourth-quarter economic growth slowed to its weakest since the global financial crisis, according to a Reuters poll, as demand faltered at home and abroad.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was set for its first weekly rise in five, though it was flat on the day. 
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.14040 (EUR=). It was on track for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent.
The 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) stood at 2.7716 percent, its highest in three weeks.
The pound was 0.4 percent lower at $1.2932 , after climbing to a two-month peak of $1.3001 on hopes that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. 
British retail sales fell for the first time since March during the three months to December, confirming a slowdown in consumer spending as Brexit draws near.
Prime Minister Theresa May survived a vote of confidence this week, removing some political uncertainty for now. The longer-term prospects for Britain and its markets remained far from clear, though. 
U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) extended Thursday's gains, adding 1.5 percent to $52.84 per barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 1.3 percent at $61.99 per barrel and on track to gain roughly 2 percent on the week.
Elsewhere in commodities, palladium  was 1.2 percent higher at $1,412.50 an ounce after rising to an all-time high of $1,434.50 overnight.
Demand has recently outstripped supply for the metal, used in emissions-reducing catalytic converters for cars. Palladium also appeared to get a boost from hopes for further government stimulus in China, the world's biggest auto market. 
Spot gold  was down half a percent at $1,285.03 an ounce, after relinquishing its spot as the most expensive precious metal to palladium early in December.

459,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Genomic Health GHDX,"Cancer has long been a scourge of humankind and treatments and/or cures have always been iffy because every cancer, like every person, is different, observes Tony Daltorio, editor of Investors Alley's Growth Stock Advisor.
When cancer occurs, small changes in the genetic letters can change what a genomic word or sentence means. A changed letter can cause the cell to make a protein that doesn’t allow the cell to function properly. Such proteins can make cancer cells grow quickly and cause damage to neighboring cells. By studying the cancer genome, scientists can discover what letter changes are causing a cell to become cancerous.
With a better understanding of the genetic mutations, doctors will then be able to provide cancer treatment therapies that specifically target changes in the cancer's genomic profile. Information on the genomics of a patient's unique cancer will let doctors better determine the appropriate course of treatment — in effect, precision cancer treatment focusing on a person's individual cancer.
These even more targeted assessments study the DNA profile of the patient’s cancer, searching for genetic abnormalities that can be matched to a particular drug therapy that may not have otherwise been considered.
Dr. Maurie Markman, President of Medicine and Science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, said of advanced genomic testing. “This is an incredibly powerful, positive force in medical care. We were in the Dark Ages before this.”
That bring us to Genomic Health (GHDX), our top pick for aggressive investing in the coming year. With its Oncotype IQ Genomic Intelligence Platform, the company is a pioneer in the translation of clinical and genomic big data into actionable results for treatment planning for cancer patients.
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that many women with early-stage invasive breast cancer could safely forgo chemotherapy, if they score in the mid-range or lower for risk that their cancer will recur, as measured by Genomic Health's Oncotype DX.
The results of the study — the largest breast cancer treatment trial to date — were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, where doctors hailed the results as “practice changing”. Translation: it will spare a lot of unnecessary chemotherapy in women with breast cancer. Now doctors can tell 70% of their patients that they don't need to agonize over whether to get chemo or not.
The Oncotype DX test costs $4,600 and is typically reimbursed by insurance, according to Genomic Health. The market opportunity is still there with currently only about 60% of U.S. patients who could potentially benefit from it are taking the gene test.
Genomic Health is more than a 'one-trick pony'. It is also a leader in testing for prostate cancer in men with its Oncotype DX test that takes a sample from a prostate biopsy and analyzes 17 genes in it to estimate how aggressive a cancer may be. And the company continues to expand its range of tests, making Genomic Health a buy in this new exciting field of medicine.

460,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- The Medicines Company MDCO,"2018 was a difficult year for The Medicines Company (MDCO) with the stock languishing as biotech investors looked elsewhere; in our view, 2019 will be a turnaround year, making this our top speculative pick, asserts biotech specialist John McCamant, editor of The Medical Technology Stock Letter.
Our confidence is boosted by the company’s activist Board of Directors led by M&A specialist Alex Denner who recently pressed long-time CEO Clive Meanwell to step aside.
Meanwell is staying with MDCO, for he was both the architect and the founder of the company. His many accomplishments include acquiring inclisiran from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) on the cheap and orchestrating the design of the ORION clinical program.
With the trials on auto-pilot and expecting to begin releasing Phase III data by Q3:19, the Board is taking the steps to remove anything that investors might perceive as an obstacle to delivering the value of this extremely attractive compound, a potential inexpensive virtual “high cholesterol vaccine.” 
Over the years, Meanwell developed a love-hate relationship with the Street. Hence, the announcement to replace him was not entirely surprising to us — someone has to take the blame for the consistently weak stock price, even though it is hardly Meanwell’s fault. The new CEO Mark Timney is a healthcare leader with over 25 years of industry experience in multi-national Big Pharma companies.
The other overhang in investors’ eyes was the need for additional financing before the first of the ORION registration studies comes due. Hence, right after the CEO change, the Company announced that it is raising $150 million via a convertible debt offering.
In our view, the two major overhangs for the stock have been removed and The Medicines Co. still remains an incredibly undervalued risk-reward, setting the stage for a rebound in 2019. 
Lastly, the company remains a prime takeover candidate with a fully owned late-stage asset, inclisiran, which is a second generation RNAI-based PCSK9 inhibitor that has demonstrated 50+% reductions in LDL which has the potential to significantly undercut the first generation monoclonal antibodies that have been selling poorly due to their high price. 
In addition to providing a significant price advantage that should open up the market, inclisiran will have very high patient compliance as it could be administered as infrequently as once every six months making it a virtual “high cholesterol vaccine”.
Denner’s strong Board presence significantly increases the odds of a takeout as he has been very successful at biotech acquisitions in the recent past. The Medicines Co. is a buy under $40 with a target price of $65.

461,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- CMS Energy Corp. CMS,"The electric utility business at CMS Energy Corp. (NYSE:CMS) provides a stable earnings stream supported by continued capital investment, notes Argus Research analyst Jacob Kilstein.
Over the last fifteen years, EPS has grown at an above-peer average rate of 7%. Management continues to project annual EPS growth of 6%-8% — better than the average of 5%-7% for most utilities.
The company benefits from a favorable location in Michigan, with a rising population, a high proportion of skilled labor, a business-friendly regulatory environment, and relatively low exposure to severe weather events.
We believe that the company’s consistent, above-average growth more than offsets concerns about the stock’s high valuation or the negative impact of rising interest rates.
The shares trade at 20.5-times our 2019 EPS forecast, above the peer median of 18.8 for electric and gas utilities with fully regulated operations.
Our $56 target implies a P/E of 22.4, which we feel is appropriate given the company’s consistent above-average performance. Our 12-month target price is $56 per share.

462,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- General Electric and Janus Henderson GE JNS,"For conservative investors in 2019, my top idea is Janus Henderson (JNS); for more risk-oriented investors, my top pick is  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), explains Bruce Kaser, editor of The Turnaround Letter.
JanusHenderson is a $378 billion (assets) investment manager. The shares have been weighed down by concerns over asset outflows from weak mutual fund performance combined with clients’ growing preference for ETFs, of which Janus offers very few. 
Its 2017 merger of equals didn’t go as smoothly as expected. However, Dick Weil, who led Janus’ prior turnaround, is now the sole CEO, and we believe he will bring improvements to the combined company. Most compelling is Janus’ valuation, at a very modest 6.8x earnings and 3.7x EBITDA. 
The company is generating considerable free cash flow and its cash balance is greater than its outstanding debt. Its 7.4% dividend yield looks sustainable.
Following General Electric’s jaw-dropping fall from the pinnacle of Corporate America, GE is a chastened company determined to work its way back from the brink.
Its highly-capable new CEO is rapidly taking remedial action: it filed to IPO its healthcare unit, is divesting many of its other operations and ownership stakes including Baker Hughes, announced a split-up of its struggling Power unit, replaced another board member, and is replacing its long-time independent auditor. 
While there are still many uncertainties and risks ahead, the company appears to be finally moving in the right direction. Its heavily sold stock appears to reflect all but a worst-case scenario.

463,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Smith & Nephew plc SNN,"With so much political and global uncertainty, it doesn’t look like this market volatility is going to cease anytime soon. And since the stock market is the best place to build a retirement portfolio overtime, it’s important to keep safety — as well as growth — in mind, suggests Nancy Zambell, editor of Wall Street's Best Investments.
With that thought, I’m focused on finding pockets of the market that hold good opportunities for each of these investment goals. And one strategy that may be worth a look is adding some low-beta stocks to your portfolio.
The definition of beta is simple — it compares the volatility, or systemic risk, of a stock to the volatility of the market. In other words, it measures a stock’s response to market swings. If a stock has a beta of 1, that means the price of that stock generally moves with the market.
Less than 1 means the stock is less volatile than the market. And more than 1 means it’s more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security’s price will move with the market.
A beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security’s price will be more volatile than the market.
And it’s important to know that beta is a measure of systematic or market risk and doesn’t tell us anything about the specific risk of the company itself. That’s why it’s essential to use the measure as just one parameter in your overall stock analysis.
With that in mind, I ran a list of low-beta stocks, then put them through my analytic process to see which ones also exhibited the other important characteristics of a good long-term stock: growing earnings, good cash flow, reasonable debt, and investor and analyst interest.
One of my favorite results of that study is Smith & Nephew plc (SNN). It operates in the best-performing sector of the S&P 500 last year — Healthcare, which returned an average gain of 4.7%.
The company makes medical devices — primarily for hips and knees — and sells them in more than 100 countries around the world.
Some of its products include sports medicine joint repair products, arthroscopic enabling technologies such as high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources, and monitors to assist with surgery, radio frequency, electromechanical and mechanical tissue resection devices, and hand instruments for removing damaged tissue.
Additionally, the company offers internal and external devices used in the stabilization of severe fractures and deformity correction procedures; robotics-assisted surgery, knee implant products; and hip implant products for the reconstruction of hip joints. SNN also provides advanced wound care products for the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic wounds.
For its third quarter, Smith & Nephew reported sales of $1,169 million, up 2% on a reported and 3% on an underlying basis. Its underlying revenue growth in the U.S. was 4%, and 10% in Emerging Markets. The company saw excellent growth in its Reconstruction, Sports Medicine Joint Repair and Advanced Wound Devices.
The company has paid dividends since 1937 and has a current annual yield of 1.50%. Technically and fundamentally, the shares look excellent, with bullish rankings from the company’s 15 analysts. Buy now for appreciation and steady dividend cash flow.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Japan Inc profits under siege from China slowdown,"By Stanley White and Yoshiyasu Shida
TOKYO (Reuters) - Two prominent Japanese electronics and equipment makers warned of profit declines over the past week due to the impact of the U.S.-Sino trade war, stoking worries of widespread cuts to corporate earnings forecasts and a hit to economic growth. 
 Nidec Corp  (T:6594), whose tiny motors are found in phones, PCs, cars, and robots, slashed its annual operating profit outlook by a quarter on Thursday, saying the trade war and a slump in smartphone demand is discouraging manufacturers in China from spending. And Yaskawa Electric Corp (T:6506), maker of robots used in factory automation, also lowered its annual operating profit outlook for the second time in three months on Jan. 10 because of the trade war.
Japan sends around a quarter of its electronics and heavy machinery exports to China, so it is heavily exposed to the current bout of weakening demand in the world's second-largest economy.
And because companies quickly cut employee bonuses and capital expenditure when sales fall and inventories start piling up, the potential blow to Japan's growth is significant, economists say.
""I suspect a lot of economists will downgrade Japan's growth forecasts for the first quarter of this year, because downside risks have clearly increased,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Electronics and capital goods drive Japan's manufacturing, but China is slowing, and we cannot be optimistic.""
Washington's attempt to lower the U.S. trade deficit has triggered tit-for-tat tariff hikes with Beijing that has put business leaders and policymakers on edge. 
China's economy is taking a big hit as exports slow, factory activity drops off, and consumers' demand for the latest tech gadgets evaporates.
China's woes are now rippling across the globe, triggering warnings on sales or profits from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) <005630.KS> to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330).
HIGH INVENTORIES
Nidec's output of parts for autos and home appliance manufacturers in China tumbled by 30-40 percent in November and December as these customers adjust for high inventories, which could last for another six months, said Nidec chief executive Shigenobu Nagamori who founded the company in 1973.
""In my long management career I have never seen a downturn like we've seen in November and particularly in December,"" Nagamori said. But he ruled out changing business plans for now.
There are many Japanese companies who make goods for similar customers and are now in the same position as Nidec. Around 37 percent of Japan's exports are made up of either electronic parts or manufacturing equipment, which leaves it vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand.
Japan's overall exports slowed to a crawl in November as shipments to China weakened, finance ministry data showed. During the same month machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, also stalled as manufacturers cut their orders.
Amid the weakening data, some Japanese electronics makers remain optimistic that they can offset declining sales by tapping demand for parts used in electronic vehicles and self-driving cars.
One example is parts maker Alps Electric Co (T:6770), which derives around 60 percent of its revenue from its auto business.
""We are a little worried about China,"" said Takashi Sogo, group manager of public and investor relations at Alps Electric.

""However, our products in the auto segment tend to go to luxury cars, and we think this business will remain stable.""

Earlier this week, visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette cautioned Israel over Chinese investment in the country, suggesting Israel's allies could limit intelligence-sharing with it as a result.
This echoed concerns conveyed by U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the use of Chinese telecommunications equipment in sensitive sectors.
""We are of course sensitive to the U.S. sensitivities. And we are taking them into account,"" Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said when asked about the U.S. remarks on 102 FM Tel Aviv Radio. He had spoken with Brouillette about the issue.
""It's clear we have good relations with China and that's very important, and with Russia and almost the whole world, but the United States is our number one ally. That's how it has been and how it will be,"" said Steinitz.
Asked about concerns over any potential information theft, he said: ""We are good at protecting ourselves.""
The Trump administration, seeing a risk of Chinese telecoms being used for espionage, has taken steps meant to curb market penetration by Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), two of China's biggest network equipment makers.
Both firms have denied that their products are used to spy.
In December 2016 Huawei acquired Israel's HexaTier, whose technology secures databases in the cloud, for $42 million. This followed a visit to Israel by the Chinese technology giant's CEO. That same month Huawei also acquired IT research firm Toga Networks for an undisclosed amount.
Israeli media have reported that ZTE has shown interest in Israel's tech sector as well since it sent a senior delegation to the country in 2013.
Israel and China do more than $10 billion a year in trade.

Chinese investment in Israeli technology has been on the rise for years. Israeli tech startups raised $325 million from Chinese investors in the first three quarters of 2018, up 37 percent from a year earlier, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. The third quarter was the strongest for Chinese investment in the past five years.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 05:57AM ET</span>",Trian to skip PPG board challenge after new commitments: sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Trian Fund Management LP will not challenge PPG Industries Inc's (N:PPG) board of directors at its 2019 shareholder meeting after the U.S. paints and coatings company met some of the activist hedge fund's demands and announced new financial targets, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Trian, run by billionaire Nelson Peltz, asked PPG last October to replace its Chief Executive Michael McGarry with former CEO Chuck Bunch, look at how it uses its balance sheet, explore a break-up of the company, and eliminate the company's practice of re-electing only a portion of its board instead of its entirety every year.
PPG unveiled financial targets for 2019 on Thursday and said it would explore separating its architectural from its industrial coatings, as well as destagger its board and remove super majority voting. 
The company said on Thursday that the U.S. Attorney's office for the Western District of Pennsylvania is also looking into improper accounting practices from 2017 into which the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission opened a probe in June.
PPG on a conference call with analysts said it was fully cooperating with the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's office on the investigation. 
Trian will not submit its own nominees to challenge PPG's board of directors at the company's upcoming shareholder meeting, the sources said. The deadline for nominations is at the end of this week. 
""Over the last several months, PPG has actively engaged with many of our shareholders. The targets and objectives announced today resulted from PPG's planning process, are responsive to a broad set of shareholder feedback and demonstrate confidence in the Company’s long-term prospects and operational excellence,"" McGarry said in a statement.
A PPG spokesman declined to comment on Trian's plans. Trian also declined to comment.
Among the 2019 targets PPG announced were sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and a minimum 10 percent earnings-per-share growth as the standard for executive incentive compensation.
PPG shares were trading up 4 percent at $106.58 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $25 billion.
Trian's investment in PPG last year came after the Pittsburgh-based company was hit by several missteps. It acknowledged accounting irregularities that caused it to restate its earnings. In 2017, PPG made a $30 billion hostile bid for Dutch peer  Akzo Nobel  SA (AS:AKZO), which ended unsuccessfully.

Trian's largest investments are  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), where the hedge fund has board seats.

E-bikes coming from China will be subject to tariffs of between 18.8 and 79.3 percent, a filing in the EU's official journal said on Friday, in line with European Commission proposal on which EU countries voted in December.
The anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties are the latest in a series of EU measures against Chinese exports ranging from solar panels to steel, which have sparked strong words from Beijing.
The Commission found Chinese exports of e-bikes to the European Union more than tripled from 2014 until September 2017. Their market share rose to 35 percent, while their average prices fell by 11 percent.
It has also said Chinese producers benefit from controlled aluminum prices as well as advantageous financing and land rights conditions and tax breaks.
Taiwan's  Giant  (TW:9921), one of the world's largest bicycle makers, which has factories in China as well as in the Netherlands, would be subject to a rate of 24.8 percent.
EU producers include Dutch groups  Accell  (AS:ACCG) and Gazelle, Romania's Eurosport DHS and Germany's Derby Cycle Holding.
The European Bicycle Manufacturers Association said it applauded the move that it said would shield 800 small and medium sized companies employing 90,000 people.
However, it warned that Chinese e-bike manufacturers were already making their way to Europe via third countries where they were being repackaged.

LEVA-EU, a group including importers opposed to duties, said the tariffs were protectionist and absurd, saying they would hit consumers and other smaller European companies and went against the EU's climate change goals.

Deripaska has agreed to reduce his stake in London-listed En+ to 44.95 percent from 70 percent and assign any voting rights above 35 percent to a voting trust.
D. J. Baker, David Crane and David Knower will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, exercise the voting rights attached to certain shares of En+, which manages the energy and aluminum businesses of Deripaska, it said in a statement.
The company did not provide further details about the three individuals or the process of their selection. It was not also clear whether more people would join the voting trust.
The U.S. Treasury has agreed to remove sanctions against En+, aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486), in which En+ owns a 48-percent stake, and power firm EuroSibEnergo, if they restructure to reduce controlling stakes held by Deripaska, who is to remain on Washington's blacklist.
His deal with the U.S. Treasury includes Swiss commodities trader  Glencore  (L:GLEN) swapping shares in Rusal for a stake in En+.
VTB Bank (MM:VTBR), Russia's second-largest lender, will also take over a block of Deripaska's shares in En+ pledged as collateral for outstanding obligations. 

Deripaska will also donate part of his stake to a charitable foundation. Several shareholders with professional or family ties to him will also assign their voting rights to an independent third party.

It will also retain ""only the most critical temps and contractors"", according to a memo to employees from CEO Elon Musk that was posted on the company's web site. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Tesla shares, which had largely recovered from the stock market at the end of last year, fell 5% in premarket trade in response to the news.
The cuts are an effort by Tesla to cut the price and increase sales of its Model 3 sedan, the company's first mass-market product, CEO Elon Musk told employees. He said the company needed to keep the Model 3 available as federal tax breaks for its products are phased out over the course of this year.
“Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company,” Musk said in the memo.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, hitting their highest level since early December as renewed hopes for trade negotiations between the United States and China lifted markets from Wall Street to Beijing.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index was up 1 percent at 0927 GMT with trade-exposed indexes or stocks gaining most and automotives (SXAP) leading with a 1.6 percent rise. 
However, sentiment remains fragile as the U.S. government does not appear to have finalised its position on its trade talks with China.
""It seems almost impossible to sensibly gauge where U.S. – China relations stand"", Jasper Lawler from LCG said. 
""Yet the market hangs on each headline, highlighting just how sensitive it is to the ongoing trade issue"", he added.
It was not all good news for European stock prices, with some big fallers among the top movers.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) dropped about 9 percent after it said it expected to report full-year organic core earnings of around 8.1 billion euros ($9.2 billion), a drop of under 5 percent compared to the year before.
Another profit warning by Ryanair (I:RYA) also spooked investors and the low cost airline's shares dropped 4.2 percent and dragged rival easyJet (L:EZJ) down 2 percent.
""This announcement was not wholly unexpected so we do not expect the shares to react by the full potential consensus net profit adjustment"", Citi analysts said. 
The European banking sector (SX7P) was recovering, up 1.8 percent, from the previous session's losses when a profit warning by France's SocGen (PA:SOGN) hit the sector hard. 
Oil and gas stocks (SXEP) also rose strongly, up 1.5 percent, as the oil price strengthened after a report showed production fell sharply last month, easing fears about prolonged oversupply. 
Friday's corporate results included French supermarket retailer  Casino  (PA:CASP) whose shares rose 6 percent as traders and analysts said fourth quarter sales had weathered ""Yellow Vest"" anti-government demonstrations in France. 
""France has held up well despite disruption from protests"", Jefferies said in a research note. 
Other optimism came from German online meal-kit delivery service HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) which surged 16 percent after raising its revenue forecast. 
Investors are bracing for swings in European stocks as earnings test whether fears about slowing economic and corporate growth that punished equities in recent months are a reality.

Expectations are low. According to I/B/E/S Refinitiv, fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for STOXX 600 companies are expected to have grown by 6 percent, more than half the levels seen in Q3 and Q4 2017.

Goldman Sachs is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The bank has denied wrongdoing.
U.S prosecutors last year charged two former Goldman bankers with the theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. 
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said Malaysia was seeking $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs over its 1MDB deals, which included fees paid to the bank and bond coupons that were ""higher than the market rate"".
Asked by a reporter on Friday if Malaysia would drop the charges against the bank if it paid the reparations, Lim said: ""Pay the $7.5 billion, then we can discuss.""
Malaysia reopened domestic investigations into 1MDB last year, after a historic election that saw the country's first change of government in more than 60 years.
The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.
Najib has denied wrongdoing.
On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon apologized to the Malaysian people for the role played by Tim Leissner in the 1MDB scandal, but said the bank had conducted due diligence before every transaction.
Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty in the United States to conspiring to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Lim said the apology was ""necessary but not sufficient"" and that the whole scandal had caused ""agony and trauma suffered by the Malaysian people"".
""If not for the change of government, do you think Goldman Sachs would have apologized? We are talking about the largest investment bank in the world... it’s not easy to get an apology from them,"" Lim said.

""An apology is not enough. An apology with $7.5 billion, that is what matters.""

477,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 04:33AM ET</span>","Gripped by Ghosn crisis, Renault expects slight sales growth","By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) expects to deliver sales growth in 2019, despite the imminent ouster of Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and tension with alliance partner Nissan (T:7201).
""Volumes progressed across almost all our regions (in 2018), and we're entering 2019 with expectations for a slight increase in sales,"" Renault sales chief Olivier Murguet told reporters.
Murguet declined to comment on the leadership crisis engulfing Renault-Nissan following Ghosn's arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct or any sales impact it may have.
The French carmaker posted a 3.2 percent increase in vehicle sales last year, boosted by a new Chinese joint venture and rebounding demand in Russia and Latin America.
On Thursday, acting chairman Philippe Lagayette said that Renault will appoint new leadership after the French government, its biggest shareholder, called for Ghosn's replacement almost two months after his Nov. 19 arrest.
The Renault board and its nominations committee are expected to meet within days to consider potential successors including  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard, senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy and Ghosn's Renault deputy Thierry Bollore, sources have told Reuters.
Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Renault's sales rose to a record 3.88 million vehicles last year - including some 166,000 sold through its new partnership with China's Brilliance (HK:1114). Global sales excluding the joint venture fell 1.2 percent.
The carmaker only narrowly avoided being overtaken by arch-rival PSA Group, outselling the Peugeot maker by 6,530 vehicles.
Unlike Renault, PSA avoided major disruption from tougher new ""WLTP"" emissions tests introduced in September, and increased sales 6.8 percent to 3.88 million vehicles in 2018 thanks largely to its acquisition of Opel-Vauxhall.
Renault's share of the European passenger car market shed more than one point to 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter, from 10.9 percent a year earlier.
While the global sales decline - excluding Brilliance - reflected setbacks in Turkey, Iran, China and India, Renault nonetheless outperformed a weak home market, with a 0.5 percent gain in European vehicle sales including vans.
The company said it expects automotive markets to be ""stable"" in Europe and globally this year, with Russia growing 3 percent and Brazil expanding 10 percent.
Murguet also said Renault had no plans to stockpile vehicles in preparation for Britain's exit from the European Union in March, in case London and Brussels fail to reach an exit deal.

""Stockpiling is expensive and short-termist,"" Murguet said, adding: ""we'll take an extremely pragmatic sales approach and adapt extremely rapidly.""

478,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>",Ghosn received $9 million improperly from Nissan-Mitsubishi JV: companies,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn improperly received $9 million in compensation from a joint venture (JV) between Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese automakers said on Friday, raising the possibility of their ousted chairman facing a fresh charge of embezzlement.
In the latest twist to the saga of the once-feted official's fall from grace, the automakers have found that Ghosn was paid by their Netherlands-based JV without the knowledge of the unit's two other directors - Nissan Motor (T:7201) CEO Hiroto Saikawa and Mitsubishi Motor (T:7211) CEO Osamu Masuko.
Ghosn, arrested and detained in Tokyo for about two months, has already been indicted on charges of under-reporting his income for eight years at Nissan through March 2018, and temporarily transferring personal investment losses to the automaker during the global financial crisis.
""That such misconduct also occurred at our affiliate is beyond shocking ... it's sad,"" Masuko told reporters, referring to the payments made to Ghosn from Nissan-Mitsubishi B.V., registered in the Netherlands in 2017.
Both Mitsubishi and Nissan said they would consider ways to recover the amount from Ghosn, while Mitsubishi lawyer Kei Umebayashi said a criminal charge was also possible. 
""The most likely charge for this would be embezzlement,"" he told reporters at a briefing.
COMPENSATION FROM JV
According to Mitsubishi's legal team, over April-November 2018, Ghosn received around 5.8 million euros ($6.61 million) in annual pay for his role as managing director, a 1.4 million euro signing fee and an undisclosed incentive from the JV.
Reuters reported earlier this week about the alleged improper compensation to Ghosn by the JV and that Nissan was considering filing for damages, citing a source.
The unit had been intended to fund expenses for the partnership including consultant fees, joint promotional activities, workspace use and corporate jets, Masuko said. 
""From the time that the unit was established to when I was told about the payments, I had absolutely no idea that the unit was being used for such payments,"" Masuko added.
Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, could not be immediately reached by telephone for a comment on Friday. Ghosn has denied all previous charges against him.
MUDDY WATERS
The arrest of Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, and the list of charges against him have jolted the auto industry, while muddying the outlook for Nissan's three-way alliance with Mitsubishi and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
Renault has come under a lot of pressure in recent days from its biggest shareholder, the French government, to replace Ghosn as its CEO and chairman. The automaker has kept him at its helm, even as Nissan and Mitsubishi moved swiftly to oust him as chairman after his arrest.
The French automaker, however, confirmed on Thursday that it was considering new leadership, after Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called publicly for a board meeting to address his succession.
Ghosn's pay has been a hotly debated issue at Renault's shareholder meetings where he lost a vote on pay a few years ago. He has also been in news previously for hidden bonus plans.
Reuters reported in 2017 on a plan by Renault-Nissan bankers to pay millions in undisclosed bonuses via a specially created Dutch service company to Ghosn and other managers. The plan was scrapped after the Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-bonuses/exclusive-renault-nissan-considers-hidden-bonus-plan-documents-idUSKBN1941FU.

Renault owns around 43 percent of Nissan, the biggest firm in the alliance by sales and which in turn has a non-voting 15 percent stake in Renault. Mitsubishi became the smallest member when Nissan in 2016 took a 34 percent stake in it. ($1 = 0.8776 euros)

He wore an augmented-reality headset onstage and wowed the crowd with the gadget’s ability to manipulate holographic images.
Gribetz’s TED Talk especially resonated in China. Two of the country’s most recognizable technology brands, Lenovo Group Inc. (OTC:LNVGF) and Tencent Holdings Ltd.(OTC:TCEHY), wrote checks to Gribetz’s Silicon Valley-based company Meta Co., which would raise more than $80 million, said research firm PitchBook Data Inc. The reliance on Chinese money would ultimately contribute to the startup’s downfall, according to Gribetz.
On Friday, Gribetz plans to disclose details of Meta’s foreclosure and the sale of its assets to a company he won’t name. In an interview, Gribetz said concerns over escalating tariffs between the U.S. and China, and scrutiny of foreign deals left his company without funding he’d been anticipating. He referenced a previously reported $20 million investment that fell through last fall.
“Due to the trade war, the Chinese blocked this deal at the last minute,” Gribetz said. “We did not succeed in attracting new funding, and the company ran out of resources.”
While Chinese tariffs have punished American electronics makers big and small, gadget startups face fundamental challenges apart from politics. In particular, augmented-reality headsets that project digital images onto the wearer’s view of the real world have yet to live up to expectations. Some of the biggest proponents were in China. Funding for augmented reality or virtual reality startups involving Chinese investors reached nearly $1 billion in 2017, according to researcher CB Insights.
The hype has since come down. Global investment in AR or VR startups declined 35 percent last year, CB Insights said. Magic Leap Inc., the most hyped of them all, finally released a product last summer after years of toiling away in secret and sucking up more than $2 billion from investors in the U.S., China and elsewhere. Reviewers weren’t impressed. A much smaller maker of augmented-reality glasses, Osterhout Design Group, is reportedly planning to sell off its patents.
Meta had been working on its headset for several years before Gribetz’s TED Talk. The company sold the device for $1,495 through its website and pitched the product to architects, designers, auto manufacturers and other professionals who could use it to manipulate 3D holograms with their hands for visualizing data and prototypes. Meta had been exploring plans to open a Chinese subsidiary near some of its main investors, Gribetz said.
In September, Gribetz said Meta had a commitment from a Chinese private-equity and real estate firm for $20 million, which would anchor a funding round of $150 million. But the lead investor backed out, he said, at the behest of a Chinese official who cited the trade war and actions from the Trump administration. As a result, other investors withdrew, he said. Meta furloughed two-thirds of its 100 or so employees.
Without additional funding, Meta was unable to pay debt obligations, and the lender seized the San Mateo, California-based company, Gribetz said. The assets were sold at a value below the outstanding loan amount, according to a court filing in a patent infringement lawsuit against Meta. “I got hit with this trade war, and it was a very surprising and shocking thing,” he said. “I tried to do my best.”
The new owner will continue to support Meta’s customers, Gribetz said. The company’s website remains online and appears to still be taking orders for the headset and a $199 branded leather canvas messenger bag. “Meta’s assets are surviving, and they have a new home, which means they have some form of a future,” Gribetz said. “I don’t know their intentions moving forward or what they plan to do with the employees that were part of the old entity.”"

Some new hires were told they can’t start until the new fiscal year begins in April, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The travel cuts include restricting business class airfares on a unit-by-unit basis, with staff only able to select a premium cabin on every fifth round trip that takes more than 20 hours, one of the people said.
The trade war with the U.S. is casting a bigger shadow over China, with Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma warning in September about the challenges facing the company and local economy as tensions escalate. The macro slowdown is hitting everything from hardware manufacturers to the world’s biggest startup Bytedance Ltd., which is said to have barely hit its revenue target for 2018.
New hire headcounts are shrinking, one person said. A candidate was told an offer would only be extended if they were prepared to wait until April, another person said.
Staff were also told that Hangzhou-based Alibaba would no longer pay for better seats within a class, such as those with extra legroom, a person familiar said. Taxis to the airport will only reimbursed if there is a group of three traveling together, another person said.
When asked about any potential cuts, Alibaba said it’s always investing in talent and hunting for the right people.
“Long-term strategic planning and continuous upgrades of our talent pool are central to Alibaba’s future,” Alibaba said in an email.
Ma’s September warning included his concern that fallout from the trade tensions could have a much longer and bigger impact than people anticipated. He said the dispute could last 20 years and persist beyond the presidency of Donald Trump.
Analysts have already started to predict a slowdown for China’s technology sector as business confidence deteriorates and consumer spending ebbs.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates revenue among the country’s internet stocks it covers will grow 29 percent on average in 2019 -- dipping below 30 percent for the first time since at least 2015. Economists see growth in China slowing to an annual pace of 6.2 percent in 2019, the weakest pace since 1990.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 03:15AM ET</span>",Sinopec's marketing arm listing may prove hard sell in soft markets,"By Chen Aizhu and Julia Fioretti
SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp (HK:0386), Asia's top refiner, may have a hard time finding buyers for a multi-billion-dollar stock offering of its fuel marketing arm because of investor pushback against higher valuations amid tepid equity markets.
Sinopec won final regulatory approval in December for the listing of its marketing unit in Hong Kong, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The company runs the world's largest retail fuel network with over 30,000 gas stations, 23,000 convenience stores, as well as pipelines and storage for refined fuel products across China, the world's second-largest oil consumer after the United States.
But, Sinopec may have picked a bad time for an initial public offering (IPO) for a fuel marketing company amid investor fears of slowing economic growth in China, which posted a drop in exports and imports in December as its trade war with the United States drags on. Hong Kong's Heng Seng Index (HSI) has dropped 19 percent since it hit a record in January 2018.
More specifically, there are concerns about slowing Chinese oil demand growth and the potential oversupply of fuels in the country. In November, Sinochem Energy put its Hong Kong IPO on hold even after it lowered its valuation, reducing the amount of funds it expected raise to about $1.4 billion from $2 billion. 
""It will be a hard sell for Sinopec,"" said one of the two sources, a banking analyst who tracks Sinopec closely. 
""The market has an average price/earning ratio of 8 or 9 times, but Sinopec is looking for more than 10 times,"" said the analyst, referring to a common metric for valuing companies that measures how much an investor is paying for a portion of a company's earnings.
Sinopec Corp declined to comment on its IPO plans. 
The slowing market may mean a further delay for an IPO that has been under discussion since 2016. Sinopec attempted to raise $12 billion through a listing of the fuel marketing business in 2017. 
In 2014, Sinopec sold a nearly 30 percent share of the business to investors for $17.5 billion, valuing the company then at about $58 billion, in the then largest privatization push of state-owned enterprises since President Xi Jinping took office. 
This time, Sinopec will list the marketing arm through a separately incorporated entity, Sinopec Marketing Co. Ltd, which was set up just weeks after the National Development and Reform Commission and later the State Council approved the listing plan, said the second of the two sources familiar with the matter. 
""Sinopec will try its best to list its marketing division in 2019, now that the top government body has given the go-ahead,"" the source said, declining to be named as the subject was not public.
A separate banking source estimated that Sinopec's IPO could happen in the fourth quarter as the firm has not started discussing the sale with banks yet and none have been mandated to work on the deal.

SBB, in its largest ever order for rolling stock, in 2010 agreed to pay around 1.9 billion Swiss francs ($1.91 billion) for 62 trains. The project had been delayed for four years, however, and just 12 have been delivered. 
A ""dissatisfied"" SBB last week apologized to customers for repeated cancellations and delays affecting the new trains and demanded improvements from Bombardier.
Stephane Wettstein, who runs Bombardier's Swiss business, told the Aargauer Zeitung that the trains' reliability had improved considerably in recent weeks. ""In a few weeks a large part of the problems will be gone,"" he told the newspaper in an interview.
He acknowledged that more testing could have helped address the problems but dismissed calls from Swiss politicians for compensation.
""At the moment compensation payments are not a topic at all. For this a contractual claim must arise and this is not the case,"" he said.
He said the technical issues primarily concerned doors and sliding entry platforms, which did not pose safety issues, while the partners were working on how to reduce turbulence at low speeds.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 02:31AM ET</span>",Reality check for Europe Inc: investors brace for bumpy fourth quarter results season,"By Josephine Mason, Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for more wild swings in European stocks as the upcoming earnings season tests whether fears about slowing economic and corporate growth that punished equities in recent months have become a reality.
Global stock markets cratered in the fourth quarter amid worries about China's slowing economy, the damage from trade tensions, Italy's budget crisis and U.S. interest rate rises.
Investors will be scouring earnings releases for evidence that the rout which saw the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) notch up its worst quarterly performance in six years was justified.
Expectations are already low. According to I/B/E/S Refinitiv, fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for STOXX 600 companies are expected to have grown by 6 percent, more than half the levels seen in Q3 and Q4 2017. 
Excluding the energy sector, the increase would be just 3.9 percent.
Forecasts as recently as November were for 13 percent growth but a series of nasty industrial and trade data surprises from Europe and China has caused analysts to downgrade their view.
Equity strategists are braced for companies to reset expectations for the year ahead by slashing their 2019 guidance, even if some believe the market may have got ahead of itself by pricing in a slowdown or even a recession for later this year.
""It's going to be a reality check because there's been stress from many angles, with trade tensions, the auto sector in Germany, the political situation in Italy, the UK and the U.S.,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""I think there will be concerns to see whether the market was right to price lower in the last few months.""
Some reckon estimates are still too positive.
Sharon Bell, head of European equity strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), has pegged earnings growth as low as 4 percent. 
""The big difference between us and consensus is that they are assuming margins will stay the same or grow a little bit, whereas we are assuming margins will go down a little,"" she said.

UK IN FOCUS
After Apple's (O:AAPL) shock warning on revenue earlier this month, investors are more nervous than usual about nasty surprises, potentially leading to bigger-than-usual reactions.
""There's heightened nervousness about corporate results. People will be quicker to throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management.
One major market likely to catch the headlines -- for good or ill -- is London, which has priced in a significant de-rating largely because investors are fretting about the impact of a hard Brexit on companies and the economy.
With worries about a no-deal divorce from the European Union easing as parliament asserts more control over the process after rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, any comments about the outlook will be keenly watched.
In fact, so low are the expectations that the housebuilders, considered most vulnerable to the vagaries of Brexit, have surprised to the upside in recent trading updates, triggering outsized moves higher.
Take  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW): when the housebuilder stood by its full-year earnings outlook and forecast solid 2019 sales on Jan. 9, its shares had their best day in 2-1/2 years and lifted one of the sectors hardest-hit by Brexit uncertainty with them.
That reaction on relatively benign news may be a harbinger of things to come as the pace of earnings picks up, with outsized moves contributing to a volatile first quarter.
(Euro zone US Citi economic surprise Jan 17: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HfedrB)
""Market expectations have come down but you've already seen in the UK, for example, numbers which are disappointing, but better than the low expectations out there in the market,"" said Jonathan Stubbs, European equity strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
Relatively low valuations for European equities also help attract investors back in when there's the slightest indication of an improvement. 
A monthly fund manager survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) this week found 39 percent of investors see European equities as undervalued -- the biggest share since Feb 2016.
Investors pulled more than $72 billion from European equity funds in 2018, more than any other region, EPFR data shows. 
Outflows have continued so far this year, but at a slower pace than in the United States, with $2 billion pulled out in the first week of 2019 compared to U.S. outflows of $15 billion 
(European vs US earnings growth Jan 17: https://tmsnrt.rs/2T5ufpP)
Whether the tide of flows finally turns positive again depends largely on the mood music from companies over the next few weeks.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:45AM ET</span>","Germany, China pledge to open markets, deepen financial cooperation","By Michael Nienaber
BEIJING (Reuters) - Germany and China on Friday signed agreements to strengthen coordination in banking, finance and capital markets, and pledged to further open market access and deepen cooperation to broaden economic ties. 
The agreements were reached after a two-day visit to Beijing by German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz for talks with Vice Premier Liu He, who is President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser. 
Both sides reaffirmed that ""they will strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and pragmatic cooperation in the fiscal and financial fields and expand strategic cooperation,"" according to a joint statement after the talks. 
Trade between the two nations has softened amid uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade war, but both have shown a willingness to demonstrate that the world remains multilateral. 
They agreed to work to improve international economic governance, maintain the global multilateral system, fight trade protectionism and support a rule-based multilateral trading system through the World Trade Organization.
""It is important that, contrary to recent trends that we can observe elsewhere, we are seeing progress in our cooperation,"" Scholz told reporters before the talks at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the Chinese capital. 
A level playing field in terms of market access for banks and insurers is important, added Scholz.
Liu also noted the importance of strengthening trade ties.
""As the world economy slows, market volatility rises, creating greater risks,"" he told reporters.
Berlin has stressed its ""close and advantageous"" trade ties with China, the world's second largest economy compared to number four Germany. It wants to protect and strengthen sensitive German and European business sectors as China makes state-backed acquisitions in strategic industries overseas.
""If you work closely together, you learn to appreciate similarities, but also to know differences,"" Scholz said.
""And we have a lot of common interests in financial matters, and then we need to bring different perspectives together. I believe that is the very important task of this financial dialogue,"" he added. 
German-Chinese cooperation benefited their economies, Liu and Scholz said, adding they are committed to ensuring open market access and easing investment barriers in both countries.
""The two sides conducted in-depth, pragmatic, efficient and fruitful discussions, and formed a series of fruitful results and consensus,"" Liu told reporters. 
FINANCIAL COOPERATION
Both sides recognized the potential for cooperation in the financial sector and are open to financial firms deepening their cooperation in third countries, according to the statement. 
German insurers can set up wholly-owned insurance holding firms in China, whose insurers and reinsurers are welcome conduct reinsurance business in Germany, it said. 
""China commits to continued granting of national treatment for foreign insurance companies and a level playing field for domestic and foreign insurance companies,"" it said.
German banks can apply to become a primary dealer in the open market operations of the People's Bank of China (PBOC). 
The two countries will also support efforts to find areas of cooperation between China's Belt and Road initiative and the EU's strategy for linking Europe and Asia, as well as European infrastructure planning.

""I am very happy that we have succeeded in agreeing concrete, very concrete steps today,"" Scholz said. ""There must be a level playing field, reciprocity is the key.""

491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:26AM ET</span>",U.S. grand jury indicts four Audi managers in VW emissions probe,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury in Detroit on Thursday indicted four managers at Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury Audi unit as part of the U.S. government's investigation into the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating scandal, according to court documents.
VW admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. vehicles to cheat government exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2017 to felony charges. In total, 13 people have been charged in the United States, including the four Audi managers.
Managers Richard Bauder, Axel Eiser, Stefan Knirsch and Carsten Nagel all worked in Audi's engine development division in Germany. Bauder was head of Audi's Diesel Engine Development department. A Justice Department spokesman said none are in custody. All are believed to be in Germany.
Lawyers for the four could not immediately be identified.
The government previously indicted one former Audi manager in July 2017, Giovanni Pamio. The new indictment is a significant expansion of the government's criminal probe.
The four managers are charged in a 12-count indictment with conspiring to evade U.S. emissions standards in diesel vehicles sold in the United States with 3.0-liter engines. The vehicles include the 2009-2015 Audi Q7 vehicles as well as other Q5, A6, A7 and A8 diesel models and VW Touareg vehicles. They are accused of wire fraud, violating the Clean Air Act and conspiracy.
Volkswagen spokesman Pietro Zollino said the company continues ""to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.""
The indictment said the Audi managers realized they could not meet U.S. pollution standards given design constraints by Audi ""including the need for a large trunk and high-end sound system.""
Audi engineers told Bauder in 2008 that unless the tank was larger ""Audi had to cheat to pass U.S. emissions tests"" and ensure that drivers could go 10,000 miles between dealer service visits, the indictment said.
In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buybacks will continue through 2019.
In 2017, VW also pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements in a U.S. court. Under the plea deal, the automaker agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years.
U.S. prosecutors previously charged former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn, who remains in Germany. Two other former VW executives have pleaded guilty in the investigation and are in prison. Germany does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in U.S. courts.
Former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was not among those indicted. He is being investigated in Germany for his alleged role. 

VW in October terminated Stadler’s contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions cheating.

492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>",The Promise of 5G Is the Problem With Huawei in Eyes of Critics,"(Bloomberg) -- The new wireless technology known as 5G will do more than make mobile phones faster -- it will link billions of devices, revolutionizing transportation, manufacturing and even medicine. It will also create a multitude of potential openings for bad actors to exploit.
The vulnerability helps explain the rising tension between the U.S. and Huawei Technologies Co., China’s largest technology company. Huawei is pushing for a global leadership role in 5G, but American officials suspect that would help Beijing spy on Western governments and companies.
“Huawei’s significant presence in 5G creates a new vector for possible cyber-espionage and malware,” Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission that advises Congress, said in an interview. By connecting whole new classes of products, 5G “creates new vulnerabilities.”
The technology holds great promise. Forests of gadgets will communicate instantly via millions of antennas. Cars will talk to each other to avert lethal crashes, factory foremen will monitor parts supplies and doctors can perform remote surgery as video, sound and data flow without delay. Connections will be 10 to 100 times faster than current standards -- quick enough to download an entire movie in seconds.
Yet U.S. national security officials see billions of opportunities for spies, hackers and cyber-thieves to steal trade secrets, sabotage machinery and even order cars to crash. Citing security threats, the U.S. has been pushing allies to block Huawei from telecommunications networks. The U.S. Congress has banned government agencies from buying the company’s gear.
The company denies that it is a threat. “The fear about Huawei and 5G is misplaced,” Andy Purdy, chief security officer for Huawei in the U.S., said in an interview. “This is a strengthened network, a more secure network.”
The new technology will require an overhaul of telecommunications infrastructure. The term 5G stands for a fifth generation, to succeed the current fourth generation of mobile connectivity that has made video sharing and movie streaming commonplace.
Standards for 5G are being written, and large-scale commercial deployment isn’t expected until 2020, according to the U.S.-China review commission. Major U.S. carriers AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). are rolling out small-scale versions of the service.
In the meantime, the number of internet-connected devices is growing by nearly one-third each year, and will reach 25.1 billion by 2021, according to an estimate by consulting firm Gartner Inc.
As those changes unfold, Huawei is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. and its allies.
Its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada at the behest of the U.S. in December on fraud charges linked to alleged Iran sanction violations. A sales executive was arrested last week in Poland on suspicion of espionage and fired over the weekend.
“His alleged actions have no relation to the company,” Huawei said in an emailed statement, noting: “The incident in question has brought Huawei into disrepute.”
A federal criminal investigation of possible parts theft from T-Mobile US Inc. was revealed this week. China’s foreign ministry said Thursday the legal dispute between Huawei and T-Mobile had already been resolved, and expressed concern about the motives behind the “reinvestigation.”
The company, founded by Ren in 1987, has emerged as a premier overseas presence for China, with a projected $108 billion in annual sales and operations extending to Africa, Asia and Europe.
Ren, in a rare discussion with foreign reporters on Tuesday, denied suggestions that Huawei aids the Chinese government in espionage, saying it has no regular contact with Beijing.
“Some countries have decided not to buy equipment from Huawei,” he said. “Therefore, we can shift our focus to better serve countries that welcome Huawei. We can build high-quality networks in those countries to prove that we are trustworthy.”
Ren also called Donald Trump “a great president” and said he’ll take a wait-and-see approach as to whether the U.S. leader will intervene on behalf of his daughter. Trump in December said he would intervene if it helped win a trade deal with China.
Huawei holds an ever-growing share of the world’s smartphone market and it and China’s government have both made it a priority to develop 5G capabilities. Already Huawei is the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, with 28 percent of a $37.2 billion market in 2017, according to the U.S.-China review commission.
Huawei has said that blacklisting its equipment without proof will hurt the industry and disrupt the development of new high-speed technology.
In its latest annual report, Huawei said it had conducted 5G tests with more than 30 leading carriers in more than 10 cities around the world. “We have been investing heavily in 5G research since 2009,” the company said.
Huawei has always maintained that it’s independent and doesn’t give the Chinese government access to its equipment.
Misgivings, however, continue to flourish in the West.
Retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding, a former member of the National Security Council under the Trump administration, has privately circulated a memo painting a future of communications dominated by China. Eventually, alternatives to its network technology won’t exist, because other suppliers won’t be able to compete with government-subsidized offerings from Huawei and fellow Chinese gear maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., Spalding said in the memo.
Once China controls the market for internet-connected devices, it will be able “to weaponize cities,” Spalding said in the memo: “Think of self-driving cars that suddenly mow down unsuspecting pedestrians. Think of drones that fly into the intakes of airliners.”
Spalding left the National Security Council last year after he called for an enlarged U.S. government role in communications, creating an uproar because networks in the U.S. are privately owned and managed.
Chinese laws obligate the nation’s telecommunications operators to provide its intelligence services unfettered access to their networks, James Mulvenon, a China expert at the SOS International intelligence consultancy, told the U.S.-China review commission at a March hearing.
Mulvenon called Huawei “a legitimate globally competitive $90 billion plus company” and said “it is not a front company or a platform for Chinese intelligence.”
But, he said, “Given the nature of the political and legal environment in China, they would not be able to refuse a request, a subsequent request, from the Chinese government for access” to a network that Huawei runs.
In the U.S., telecommunications companies have also played a role in surveillance. For instance, in 2013 members of Congress confirmed they knew of a secret court order compelling Verizon Communications Inc. to turn over data about its customers’ calls. In 2015, Congress voted to stop the National Security Agency from collecting bulk records on Americans’ phone calls and instead get a court order for specific records.
As 5G is introduced, there’s an increasing push to bar risky equipment from crucial networks, said Wessel, of the U.S.-China commission.
“The internet is the backbone of our economy, the backbone of our security apparatus and the workings of our government,” Wessel said. “And we need to take substantial steps to make sure we have confidence in the security of those networks.”

Milner’s Apoletto funds and his investors hold stakes in Xiaomi worth $1.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He acquired the positions for about $457 million over multiple funding rounds prior to the July IPO, Xiaomi’s prospectus shows.
Milner, an early investor in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., quadrupled his money even though Xiaomi’s market value has tumbled by more than $18 billion since the IPO. The declines accelerated when a six-month lockup period expired on Jan. 9, promoting some investors to sell the stock.
Milner is worth $3.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s also general partner of DST Global, which owns stakes in Revolut Ltd. and Robinhood Markets Inc.
A spokesman for Milner didn’t reply to a message seeking comment.
Apoletto held 4.99 percent of the listed shares on Jan. 9, according to a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. About 3.5 percent of the listed stock was distributed among his investors last week. Apoletto’s holdings have dropped below the disclosure threshold required by the exchange, so it’s unknown whether the investors have since sold the shares.
Last week, Xiaomi Chairman Lei Jun and Chief Financial Officer Chew Shou Zi agreed to extend their share-trading lock-up for an additional 365 days.
Lei and seven other Xiaomi co-founders had combined stakes at the IPO date worth $26.3 billion. The value of those stakes dropped to $15.1 billion as of Thursday, assuming none of them sold shares.

(Reuters) - MGM Resorts International (N:MGM) has struck a deal with hedge fund Corvex Management's founder, Keith Meister, to give him a board seat, one week after a rival activist investor was seen building a position in the casino operator.
Corvex owns roughly 3 percent of MGM's stock. Meister will join the board on Friday, expanding its size by one to 13 members, MGM said in a statement released late on Thursday.
MGM's chief executive officer and chairman, Jim Murren, said the company and Meister have been holding ""constructive dialogue"" over the last several months, and he praised the investor's track record of ""helping companies maximize value for shareholders as well as his experience in real estate and gaming.""
Speculation had mounted in recent days about a possible change to the board after Reuters reported that Starboard Value, led by Jeffrey Smith, had built a position in MGM and was considering pushing for changes.
In early January, MGM Resorts announced plans to cut costs and boost growth, proposing to increase annualized adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $300 million by the end of 2021. 
""It is clear to me that MGM is focused on driving profitable growth,"" Meister said in a statement, adding that he thinks he can help. Meister, who founded Corvex in 2010 after working for financier Carl Icahn, has sat on the boards of Yum Brands Inc and the Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), among others.
Since 2017 MGM said it has appointed four new independent directors, including Meister. 
The gambling industry has faced a shakeup in recent years as many states that used to prohibit gaming are now permitting it.

Last year MGM's smaller peer  Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR) rejected a merger approach from Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire owner of Golden Nugget Casinos. Since then speculation has mounted about Caesar's future, especially since it was announced that Mark Frissora will be leaving as chief executive next month.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 08:38PM ET</span>","Netflix forecast misses Wall Street view, shares dip","By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) forecast first-quarter revenue slightly below Wall Street estimates on Thursday, even after a record quarter for new customers, sending shares of the world's largest streaming service down 4 percent in after-hours trading. 
Investors may have been hoping for more after Netflix announced a price hike for U.S. subscribers earlier this week, usually a sign that demand is strong.
""Results won't push its stock higher from here, with most of the good news already priced in after a massive rally earlier this month,"" said Investing.com senior analyst Haris Anwar.
The company released its massively popular dystopian movie ""Bird Box"" in late December, which helped attract a record 8.8 million new paid streaming customers in the fourth quarter.
Investors, however, appear to have factored that, and the price hike, into their valuation, pushing Netflix shares up more than 50 percent since late December.
The company has staked its future on global expansion and creating original TV shows and movies to hook new customers and keep them paying monthly subscription fees. 
But it faces increasing competition from established TV and movie producers such as Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which has stopped supplying new movies to Netflix in order to stock its own streaming service planned for later this year. 
AT&T Inc (N:T) and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) also have digital offerings in the works.
""The worry is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren't going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard,"" said George Salmon, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""The battle for viewers' eyeballs is only just getting started.""
Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings played down such competition in a livestreamed interview after the company's earnings report, as his company now competes with many rivals. 
""Any one provider entering only makes a difference on the margin,"" he said. 
Netflix said it lost more of its customers' viewing time to the video game Fortnite than HBO, the premium cable network owned by AT&T.
CULTURAL SENSATION 
""Bird Box"" became a cultural sensation after its Dec. 21 release on Netflix. The company estimated that 80 million households will have watched the movie starring Sandra Bullock in its first four weeks, sparking a viral reaction online. 
The buzz came during the Christmas holiday season, when sales of phones and internet-connected TVs typically lift Netflix subscriptions. 
Netflix said its programming now accounts for about 10 percent of television screen time in the United States, a sign of its popularity but also the room for growth. Total paid streaming subscribers reached 139 million worldwide.
It added an unprecedented 781 hours of U.S. original programming in the United States during the quarter, according to Cowen & Co analysts, including drama series ""Narcos: Mexico"" and holiday films such as ""The Christmas Chronicles."" 
For the fourth quarter, Netflix reported revenue of $4.19 billion for the quarter that ended in December, slightly below the $4.21 billion that Wall Street analysts had forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
It forecast first-quarter revenue of $4.49 billion, slightly below analysts' average estimate of $4.61 billion. It sees net income of $253 million for the first quarter, well below analysts' average estimate of $371 million.
Wall Street has come to expect fast-growing Netflix to handily beat forecasts. Without a blowout quarter or ambitious forecast, shares fell 4 percent in after-hours trading to $339.40.
Netflix recently traded at about 83 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. By comparison Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) recently traded at about 60 times earnings and the S&P 500 is trading at around 15 times expected earnings. Stocks trading at high earnings multiples are more prone to sell off if growth targets are missed.

Netflix reported earnings of 30 cents per share for the quarter, lower than a year earlier due to higher spending, but above Wall Street analysts' average estimate of 24 cents, according to Refinitiv.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:37PM ET</span>",American Express misses estimates on slowing customer spending; shares drop,"(Reuters) -  American Express  Co (N:AXP) missed Wall Street's fourth-quarter profit estimates on Thursday, as the rate of customer spending slowed despite a strong U.S. holiday sales season.
The credit-card issuer's shares fell 2.4 percent in extended trading.
""For the past couple of quarters card spending for AmEx in the U.S. has been 10 percent, that dropped down to about 9 percent this quarter, that is having an effect on the stock,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Chris Brendler said.
The slowing growth came despite the United States witnessing its strongest holiday season in six years on the back of a robust economy and more deals. According to a Mastercard report on Dec. 26, holiday spending rose 5.1 percent to over $850 billion.
This strong health of the consumer spurred more customers to take loans on credit cards in the quarter, growing AmEx's loan portfolio by 12 percent in the fourth quarter. However, this also drove provisions for credit losses higher by 14 percent.
Meanwhile, expenses rose 9 percent as AmEx poured more money into offering perks such as rewards programs and lounge access at airports to better compete against companies such as JPMorgan's (N:JPM) Chase cards division and payment networks Visa (N:V) and Mastercard (N:MA).
Card member rewards expenses rose 11 percent, AmEx said.
The company said https://reut.rs/2RyxpFO its net income was $2.01 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $1.21 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier, when it took a charge due to a change in U.S. tax laws.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.74 per share, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.80, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data.

Revenue, net of interest expense, rose 7.9 percent to $10.47 billion, but fell short of analysts' estimates of $10.56 billion.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:22PM ET</span>",Consumer giants spurn risks to chase online subscribers,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) - Major consumer companies including  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Nestle (S:NESN) are chasing consumers who want food and household goods delivered automatically, even though this kind of business has not always worked. 
The companies are pitching new online subscription services, which promise stable revenues, lower delivery costs and valuable data about customers. 
The world's biggest packaged food company, Nestle, whose Nespresso coffee is already a sizeable subscription business, recently launched a subscription program for nutritional drinks in Japan and expanded ReadyRefresh, an online bottled water service, in the United States.
It also wants to expand the Tails.com subscription pet food from Britain to continental Europe, one of its executives told Reuters. It is testing the service in France for a possible launch this year. 
Unilever on Monday will launch its Skinsei brand in the United States after testing, offering ""personalized"" skincare by subscription. Unilever expanded its Dollar Shave Club subscription razor service to include cologne and beard oil in 2018 and toothpaste in 2017. 
Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (N:PG), the world's largest home and personal care company, expanded its Gillette on Demand razor subscription service to Canada. Subscribers can text when they are ready for their next shipment. 
Selling directly lets manufacturers skirt retailers, giving them more profit and control over pricing, promotions and merchandising. This helps when retailers such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) are pressing consumer product companies for discounts and pouring resources into own-label products. 
Subscription selling gives them guaranteed revenues, a better picture of customers and can make goods cheaper to deliver. 
""They're getting it to you on a specific date, but they don't have to get it to you in one or two days,"" said retail analyst Scott Mushkin at Wolfe Research. ""It's a way for them to manage down their logistics and distribution costs."" Amazon has offered discounts since 2006 with its Subscribe and Save program, which gives people up to 15 percent off when they sign up for repeat deliveries of household items. 
It is now ""a multi-billion dollar business inside Amazon"", said Tom Furphy, CEO of venture capital firm Consumer Equity Partners and former vice president of Amazon's consumables unit, which launched the service. 
WANING INTEREST 
Liz Cadman, founder of mysubscriptionaddiction.com, said children's educational boxes were the U.S. website's hottest category in 2018, followed by grooming, make-up and beauty. Biggest losers were snacks, clothing and pet goods, she said.
The trouble with subscriptions, analysts say, is high cancellation rates as consumers get bored, high marketing costs, costly delivery and the fact that people often end up with goods they don't want. 
Mondelez International (O:MDLZ) has suspended its Oreo Cookie Club, a program rolled out last year. For $20 per month, subscribers got a box containing Oreos in different flavors, with recipe cards, candy and merchandise such as Oreo-branded socks, sunglasses or cups.
After three months, Ruby Scarbrough canceled her subscription, saying in an online review that she could buy the cookies more cheaply at a store. 
Jeff Jarrett, global head of e-commerce at Mondelez, pointed to the challenges of delivering mass-market snacks economically and keeping customers interested.
Nobody has ""cracked the code"" for snack subscriptions, he said, though Mondelez may give its Oreo club another shot, likely with more flavors, better merchandise or a better online experience. 
 General Mills  (N:GIS) axed its Nibblr subscription snack business in 2015 after 18 months. A similar project from Kellogg (N:K), reportedly planned for that year, never materialized. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shut its Goodies subscription snack business in 2013 after a year.
While subscriptions delight some consumers, they frustrate others because ""you end up with too much of the product or too little"", Procter & Gamble CFO Jon Moeller told Reuters. 
GROWING, BUT HOW MUCH? 
Subscriptions represent about 10 percent of all U.S. online sales, and more than 1 percent of all retail sales, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of consumer consulting firm Strategic Resources Group.
He said subscriptions are the hottest part of the industry, growing more than 17 percent a year and outpacing overall online sales, which are growing more than 12 percent. He said subscriptions may exceed 10 percent of the US retail market in five years and 15 percent in 10 years. 
Euromonitor International says subscription shaving clubs, including Dollar Shave and Harry's, took about 12 percent of the $2.1 billion U.S. market for men's razors and blades in 2017, up from 6.4 percent two years earlier. But Dollar Shave's sales have slowed dramatically, with Unilever in October citing growth of around 10 percent year-to-date, compared to more than 50 percent in 2016, the year it bought the brand. 
Unilever said a slowdown was not unusual but it was ""pleased with performance"" at Dollar Shave, whose North American business would be close to breakeven this year. 
Unilever's global brand vice president of skincare, Valentina Ciobanu, told Reuters the company wants to make its subscriptions more flexible, because consumers demand options when they buy. 
""We don't force you to subscribe at the beginning,"" Ciobanu said about the Skinsei brand, which she created inside the company. Skinsei aimed to keep shoppers loyal in part by making changes to the products it recommends based on the season of the year and other factors, she said. 
Ciobanu said Skinsei's products could be combined into more than one million skincare regimens. She declined to give sales projections. 
However, she and other executives said it was unclear whether subscription brands would take off or remain niche. 

""For now it's still early adopters. The question mark is how long will it take to become more mass, and I think nobody has the answer to that question,"" said Bernard Meunier, who runs Nestle's Purina Petcare business in Europe, Middle East and North Africa.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 06:14PM ET</span>",Gulfport pledges share buybacks after hedge fund demand,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Natural gas and oil firm Gulfport Energy Corp said it would buy back $400 million of shares on Thursday, just hours after a public demand to that effect from hedge fund investor Firefly Value Partners.
After the close of trading, Oklahoma City-based Gulfport announced plans to buy back $400 million worth of shares in the next two years and said it bought $90 million worth of shares in the last weeks of 2018. 
""I want to underscore our commitment to further enhancing shareholder value with a newly authorized $400 million stock repurchase program to be executed within the next 24 months,"" David Wood, who was named chief executive officer late last year, said in a statement.
On Thursday morning, New York-based hedge fund Firefly had said it wanted Gulfport, which has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion, to buy back $500 million of shares.
Firefly, which owns 8.1 percent of Gulfport, said in a public letter that such a large share buyback could translate to a doubling of Gulfport's share price.
It criticized how Gulfport had allocated capital and complained that current board members might not be committed to pushing for improvements.
In its statement announcing the share buyback, Gulfport did not refer to Firefly or address its complaints.
But by the afternoon, when the eight member Gulfport board ended its meeting, management and the directors laid out a plan that some analysts said could neutralize the hedge fund's requests.
Firefly declined to comment on the Gulfport statement.
Gulfport also forecast free cash flow of more than $100 million this year and said this year's capital expenditures would be between $565 million and $600 million and be paid with cash flow. 
Last year, Gulfport had authorized $200 million worth of buybacks. 
In its critique of the company and its board, Firefly said directors do ""not seem up to the task of fixing the company's capital allocation strategy and regaining investors' trust."" It added that it may be time to add a shareholder to the board who could energize the group to push for these changes. 
""We propose an action plan that we believe allows Gulfport to create at least $9 per share of value for stockholders (over 100 percent of the current market capitalization) over the next 12 months,"" Firefly's letter said. Rising commodity prices would make the impact of the share buybacks even bigger.
The company's shares, which closed at $8.82 on Thursday, have tumbled 32 percent in the last year. 
This is the time of year investors who are pushing for change traditionally write public letters to companies that detail their complaints. Later they may run a proxy contest to seat newcomers on the board. 
Firefly has been invested in Gulfport since 2013 and there have been private discussions, the hedge fund acknowledged.
There was turmoil at the company late last year. In December it appointed Wood as CEO to replace Michael Moore, who resigned after accusations that he had misused the company's chartered aircraft and a company credit card.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 05:54PM ET</span>",U.S. House backs sanctions on Russia's Rusal in symbolic vote,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives backed legislation on Thursday to keep sanctions on companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, including aluminum firm Rusal (HK:0486), but the Trump administration is expected to lift them as soon as Friday.
The Democratic-led House voted by an overwhelming 362 to 53 in favor of a resolution of disapproval of the U.S. Treasury Department's decision last month to lift sanctions on the core businesses of Deripaska: Rusal, its parent, En+ ; and power firm EuroSibEnergo Plc.
But the vote was only symbolic, after a similar measure failed in the Republican-led Senate on Wednesday, in a victory for President Donald Trump.
Later in the day, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tried to have the Senate vote but Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked it.
Amid questions about Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, many members of the U.S. Congress - both Democrats and some of Trump's fellow Republicans - have been questioning the administration's plan to water down the toughest penalties imposed on Russian entities since the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Some lawmakers from both parties have said it is inappropriate to ease sanctions on companies tied to Deripaska, a Putin ally, while Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigates whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Moscow. 
""We are dealing with the enemy. We are in an investigation,"" Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, said before the vote as she exhorted House members to support the resolution.
The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and asked him to wait to lift the sanctions saying Congress still had many questions about the decision. Treasury officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump administration officials, and many Republicans who opposed the resolution, said they worried about the impacts of the sanctions on the global aluminum industry and that Deripaska had lowered his stakes in the companies so that he no longer controls them, a sign the sanctions were working.
""Adjusting sanctions on companies that help us punish and isolate Russian bad actors like Oleg Deripaska will encourage more companies to cooperate with America to severely hobble Russia,"" Representative Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees trade, said in a statement. Brady opposed the resolution.

Under the administration plan, Deripaska himself would remain under sanction.

-  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) shares were off 2.5% after hours. Fourth-quarter earnings missed the consensus estimate by 6 cents a share. Its first-quarter estimate was a little light. The company blamed weakness in stagnating results from its merchant and network services unit.
- JB Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) shares were up 6.6% after hours. Fourth-quarter earnings missed estimates.

1. Netflix Slumps After Hours
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) could weigh on tech stocks tomorrow after reporting mixed earnings after the bell today.
The consensus on Wall Street seemed to be that the numbers weren’t so hot as the stock fell more than 3% after hours.
But guidance was also mixed, so look for lots of commentary on whether to look on Netflix as half full or half empty.
A lot will depend on whether you like your metrics new-fangled or old-fashioned.
If you like the new stuff, first-quarter subscriber addition guidance topped forecasts. But earnings guidance looked well below expectations.
2. Schlumberger Earnings on Tap
Earnings are few on the ground tomorrow, typical of a Friday.
But there will be results that are a good proxy for the oil market coming from Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) ahead of trading.
On average, analysts expect that the world’s largest oilfield services and equipment company earned 37 cents per share on revenue of about $8 billion.
Investors will also be looking for any insight into drilling activity in the wake of the sharp drop in oil prices at the end of last year.
Oil buffs will also be checking in on the Baker Hughes oil rig count, which stood at 873 last week. It arrives at 1 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
3. Michigan Sentiment Index Expected to Drop
Among economic indicators, the latest reading on consumer confidence will lead the way tomorrow morning.
The University of Michigan will release its preliminary January consumer sentiment index at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the index fell slightly to 97. Measures of expectations and current conditions are also forecast to have dropped slightly."

Sears picked Lampert's hedge fund ESL Investments Inc as the winner at a bankruptcy court-supervised auction after his latest bid topped an earlier $5 billion proposal following weeks of talks.
The deal would keep open more than 400 stores, preserve up to 45,000 jobs and ESL would acquire substantially all of the company, including its ""Go Forward Stores"" on a going-concern basis, Sears said.
""We are pleased to have reached a deal that would provide a path for Sears to emerge from the chapter 11 process,"" the restructuring committee of Sears' board of directors said in a statement.
The official committee of unsecured creditors said in a court filing it opposed the sale and asked court permission to file under seal a complaint against ESL for years of misconduct.
""ESL’s current bid to 'save the company' is nothing but the final fulfillment of a years-long scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert’s and ESL’s own pockets,"" the committee said. 
The committee said it wanted to disallow the debt that ESL used to bid for Sears and wanted to unwind deals from recent years that the committee said benefited Lampert, including the sale of real estate assets and the spin-off of Lands' End.
ESL said in a statement it would ""vigorously contest"" any effort to pursue claims against it or Lampert. The fund said it had extended $2.4 billion to Sears for its transformation plan and its deals were approved by the board's independent directors. 
A Sears spokesman declined to comment.
The sale to ESL must be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge and a hearing to consider the deal is currently scheduled for Feb. 1. If approved, the transaction is expected to close on or about Feb. 8, Sears said.

More than 20 U.S. retailers have filed for bankruptcy since the start of 2017 in the face of e-commerce competition from companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Audi, a unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group, has invested billions of euros in Hungary and operates one of its largest production facilities worldwide in the central European country.
The Audi Hungaria Independent Union said it had rejected the most recent offer from the company, which was for a 10 percent wage increase now and another 10 percent in January 2020.
The union, which represents 7,300 members out of more than 12,000 at the Hungarian plant, wants an immediate 18 percent raise and said it felt a 40 percent wage hike would allow its workers a decent standard of life.
They said the company's Slovakian workers earn on average 28 percent more than Hungarians, Polish workers earn 39 percent more, and Belgian workers earn 3.6 times as much as they do.

Audi said in a statement on Wednesday that current wages and the raise plan they offered were competitive and outstanding in Hungary.

Wall Street pared some gains as investor hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be in the offing were dealt a blow by a Treasury spokesman. The spokesman downplayed a report from the Wall Street Journal suggesting that U.S. officials were warming up to the idea of scaling back tariffs on Chinese imports to persuade Beijing to consider deeper concessions on trade.
“Neither Secretary Mnuchin nor Ambassador Lighthizer have made any recommendations to anyone with respect to tariffs or other parts of the negotiation with China,” the spokesman told CNBC.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country, and many hope a deal can be agreed upon, or at the very least stave off the threat of further escalation.
The 90-day trade-war truce is due to end March 1. Without a deal, President Donald Trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and raise duties on imports from China to 25% from 10%.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), both barometers of global trade given their large international exposures, closed more than 2% higher, underpinning industrials and the broader market.
Industrials were also led higher by defense stocks after President Trump outlined a revamped U.S. missile defense strategy.  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) ended the day higher. Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), the big distributor of industrial and construction supplies, also played a role in the broader move higher after it reported earnings and revenue that topped consensus estimates. Shares rose nearly 6%.
Energy names, meanwhile, shrugged off a slip in oil prices on the back off concerns over weak demand and rising U.S. output.
Financials continued to tack on gains even as shares of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fell after its earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter missed estimates.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ended the day higher.
In other corporate earnings, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock fell more than 2% in afterhours trade on a mixed fourth quarter report that beat analysts' expectations but revenue fell short. The streaming giant posted subscriber additions ahead of company guidance.

524,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Nissan to lay off 700 contract workers in Mississippi,"(Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) U.S. arm said on Thursday it plans to lay off up to 700 contract workers at its Mississippi assembly plant, citing slowing sales of its vans and Titan pickup trucks.
The company has about 6,500 direct employees and contract workers in Canton, Mississippi.
The news comes as the Japanese automaker grapples with the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November.
The lay-offs are unrelated to Ghosn's ouster as chairman, spokesman Brian Brockman said.
The automaker said it was cutting production shifts of Nissan Vans to one from two, and Frontier and Titan pickup trucks to two shifts from three.
Brockman said that while the affected direct Nissan employees on those shifts will be reassigned to other areas of the plant, some associates will remain unassigned.
""Nissan is adjusting production capacity at its Canton manufacturing facility to match market demand and maintain healthy inventory levels,"" the spokesman added.
The Associated Press had reported the news earlier in the day.
Nissan last month announced plans to lay off about 1,000 workers at two factories in Mexico.

525,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>","Netflix Stock Slumps on Mixed Results, Guidance Worries","Investing.com - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported fourth quarter earnings  that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday but revenue that fell short of forecasts.
The stock bounced around after hours as investors tried to get a handle on the numbers. Subscriber additions came in ahead of company guidance, but profit guidance for the first quarter looked shy of estimates.
Paid subscriber additions, the key metric for the company, came in at 8.8 million for the fourth quarter, above company guidance of 7.6 million and above Wall Street forecasts. Domestic subscribers rose by 1.53 million, about in line with forecasts, but international subscribers jumped by 7.31 million, well ahead of estimates.
For the first quarter Netflix sees subscriber additions of 8.9 million, 1.6 million in the U.S. and 7.3 million internationally, which is above forecasts of around 8 million, according to Briefing.com.
But the company also said it sees earnings of 56 cents per share in the first quarter, well below the Street consensus of 86 cents per share.
Shares were down 3.2% at 4:35 PM ET (21:35 GMT).
The company reported earnings per share of $0.30 on revenue of $4.19 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $0.25 on revenue of $4.21 billion. That compared to EPS of $0.41 on revenue of $3.29 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Netflix announced it would be raising its main subscription service price earlier this week.
The company has been adding subscribers at a good clip, fueled by a ramped up spending on original content. The company had said it planned to spend $8 billion in 2018, $1 billion more than 2017, on creating original content.
The additions come against the backdrop of intensifying competition in the streaming services space. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) plan to launch their services later this year, joining a field that currently includes Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video service and Hulu.
But the aggressive spending on content has been accompanied by a doubling of the company's debt, to $6.50 billion in 2017 from $3.36 billion in 2016.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>",Wall Street advances as industrials jump on trade hopes,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday as hopes of a resolution to the trade dispute between the United States and China boosted industrial shares and lifted investor sentiment.
Stocks spiked higher in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30.
S&P 500 industrial stocks (SPLRCI), which have been sensitive to trade developments, rose 1.7 percent. They held most of their gains even as U.S. stocks pulled back from session highs after a Treasury spokesman said that Mnuchin had not made any such recommendations.
""The market reaction is really telling,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""It shows how badly people want the trade war to end.""
Earlier, industrial stocks had moved higher as shares of defense contractors rose after President Donald Trump unveiled a new U.S. missile defense strategy. Shares of  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) advanced 3.3 percent, and shares of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) gained 2.4 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 162.94 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,370.1, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 19.86 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,635.96 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 49.77 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,084.46.
With Thursday's gains, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Dec. 3. The S&P 500 is 10.1 percent away from its Sept. 20 record close after having rallied from a 20-month low on Christmas Eve on concerns over a global economic slowdown.
Also helping to boost stocks on Thursday was a rebound in financial shares, which ended 0.5 percent higher after having dropped as much as 1 percent. The financial index has posted gains for seven straight sessions.
However, shares of  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) ended 4.4 percent lower after the investment bank reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit.
In after-hours trading, shares of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) fell 2 percent after the video-streaming company reported quarterly results.
Analysts have cut their fourth-quarter profit growth forecast for S&P 500 companies to 14.2 percent from 20.1 percent estimated on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.45-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 23 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.19 billion shares, compared to the 8.58 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Bogle's legacy: Booming index funds with perhaps too much reach,"By Ross Kerber and David Randall
BOSTON (Reuters) - John ""Jack"" Bogle, the founder of index investment pioneer Vanguard Group Inc, changed Wall Street by convincing millions to turn away from mutual funds that actively pick stocks, but his legacy will also be shaped by the unintended consequences of index funds.
Bogle, who died of cancer at age 89 on Wednesday, saved investors billions of dollars by devising and championing low-fee funds that tracked markets instead of trying to beat them.
However, now that index funds and similar exchange-traded funds hold roughly $6.7 trillion, or 35 percent of long-term fund assets, concerns are rising that the products may reduce competition, distort markets, or prove too deferential to management and corporate directors. 
As recently as 2007, index funds and ETFs accounted for only 15 percent of long-term fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute. The 2007-2009 financial crisis buttressed Bogle's view that in the long run low-cost passive vehicles hold fundamental cost advantages over actively managed funds. Only 44 percent of active managers outperformed their benchmarks during the period, according to Vanguard's research.
A generation came to believe active managers could not prevent losses, said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of mutual fund and exchange traded fund research at New York based CFRA.
At the same time the growth of index-based products led to the easy availability of ETFs that take leveraged bets on specific sectors, often for little to no trading commission costs, Rosenbluth said, such as Direxion's new leveraged communications services ETFs. [TAWK.P] [MUTE.P] 
Such products allow short-term bets that are inimical to Bogle's buy-and-hold philosophy.
""We now have strategies that are the opposite of buy and hold and we have fee structures that encourage much more tactical trading than he had hoped would happen,"" Rosenbluth said. Another challenge facing index funds is how they will fare in volatile markets. In theory such conditions should favor active traders who can hop into undervalued companies and sectors. For instance, as markets sank in 2018, the total return of Fidelity’s famed Contrafund (FCNTX.O) beat the S&P 500 index by 2.26 percentage points, a representative performance among large growth funds.
Still, the passive side is holding up: In the month of December passive funds received net deposits of about $60 billion, while investors pulled a record $143 billion from actively managed funds, according to Morningstar. 
For all of 2018 Vanguard led the industry with $161 billion in net deposits, followed by $136 billion to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Inc's iShares line.
Together the five largest Vanguard funds saved investors at least $5 billion in fees in 2018, compared with what they would have paid to keep the same assets in the largest active funds, estimated industry consultant Neil Bathon.
Even after Bogle left Vanguard’s board of directors in 1999 he remained a tireless advocate for index funds. ""It is quite rare to find people whose principles and conviction are as closely aligned in their personal and professional lives as they were with Mr. Bogle,"" Bathon said. 
The rapid growth of index investing has also given rise to concerns they could reduce the incentives for competition at the companies they own, or weaken proxy voting pressure on corporate directors. 
In a recent paper, professors Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School and Scott Hirst of Boston University Law School argued index fund managers have strong incentives to ""defer excessively to the preferences and positions of corporate managers,"" in return for benefits like managing corporate pension money.
Even Bogle himself had become critical of the power of the behemoth he created. In a November opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Bogle warned the continued growth of Vanguard, BlackRock and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) would become problematic.
Soon the three firms could own 30 percent or more of the U.S. stock market. ""I do not believe that such concentration would serve the national interest,"" Bogle wrote, noting how such a move would concentrate voting power with just a small number of executives. 
Jeff Ptak, Morningstar's head of global manager research, said Vanguard hardly represents a risk to market stability at its current size, but credited Bogle with raising ""constructive concerns"" about the growing influence of passive funds. 

The biggest risk posed by Bogle's approach to investing, said another Morningstar analyst, Alec Lucas, ""is to the profit margins of the average active manager who underperforms after fees.""

The Colombian congress in December approved a tax reform bill that watered down and almost halved the original revenue target to 7.8 trillion pesos ($2.4 billion), forcing the government to freeze spending to meet its 2019 fiscal goals.
Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said the government was analyzing spending freezes and spending cuts until it could obtain funds from the sale of various state assets, including the stake in Ecopetrol. 
""We are authorized to sell a part of the state's stake in this company, and this authorization is for up to 8.9 percent,"" he told a local radio station.

The state owns 88.49 percent of Ecopetrol, whose share price has risen almost 18 percent over the past year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Thursday it has partnered with another four companies as part of its goal of offering grocery home delivery in more than 100 U.S. cities.
Walmart's new partners are Point Pickup, which offers recurring same-day deliveries, and one-hour delivery company Skipcart, which uses crowdsourced labor. It has also partnered with same-day shipping firm AxleHire and Roadie, which connects senders with drivers who are already going in the needed direction. 
Walmart, the largest U.S. seller of groceries, said it will partner with the companies in four states. The company said its online grocery delivery service is available in more than 800 stores, with another 800 being added in the year ending in January 2020. 
The current 800 stores cover about 100 metropolitan areas, Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said. ""We're right at the 100 metros and will be over that number by the end of the fiscal year,"" she said. Walmart's fiscal year ends in January.
The initiative is Walmart's latest attempt to tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the ""last mile"" of delivering goods to online customers.
In March, Walmart said it would offer home delivery of groceries in 100 U.S. cities covering 40 percent of U.S. households by the end of 2018. It has since tied up with several small delivery companies like DoorDash and Postmates, which offer gig-style jobs to workers.

Walmart's aggressive expansion into home delivery follows Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, which spurred several traditional retailers to push such services fearing increased competition.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A retired Army officer who last year advised a Canadian company seeking to mine gold in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) returned to the head of Brazil's indigenous rights agency on Thursday, vowing to improve the lives of the country's native peoples.
General Franklimberg Ribeiro de Freitas had run the National Indian Foundation (Funai) until April 2018, but was fired by the previous government under pressure from farmers who considered him too sympathetic to the land rights of indigenous tribes.
He returns to Funai at a crucial time for the agency, which has lost funding and authority on land issues now settled by the farmer-friendly Ministry of Agriculture under Brazil's new right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
A respected military officer of native descent, Freitas has served in the Amazon rainforest on operations aimed at reducing deforestation by evicting illegal loggers and miners from vast reservations, such as the Yanomami territory.
""Our indigenous policy must be strengthened and our sole aim will be to improve the conditions and support we give native peoples,"" Freitas said on taking office at the Funai.
Brazil's 890,000 indigenous people from 300 tribes make up less than 1 percent of the population and live on reservation lands that cover 12 percent of its territory. Much of that land is threatened by illegal loggers and miners, along with pressure from an agricultural frontier advancing into the Amazon jungle.
On the campaign trail last year, Bolsonaro said he would not grant ""one centimeter"" more of land to indigenous peoples, whom he vowed to integrate into Brazilian society by engaging them in commercial activities and earning royalties from mining companies that would be allowed into reservations. 
Freitas, 62, served last year on an advisory board at  Belo Sun Mining Corp  (TO:BSX), a Canadian company with a project on the on the Xingú river that promises to be Brazil's largest gold mine. 
A spokeswoman for the company said its installation license has been suspended pending a report on the impact on indigenous communities adjacent to the planned open-pit mine. The general left the company at his own request in December, she said.
Freitas gained respect from subordinates during his first tenure at Funai by working to improve the quality of life for native tribes by helping them produce goods and forest crops that could be sold, agency employees said.
He appears to share Bolsonaro's view on integrating native peoples that are already in contact with Brazilian society, while insisting on the need to protect and shield uncontacted or recently contacted tribes.

Anthropologists oppose integration in order to preserve native cultures and languages. Environmentalists say the tribes are the last guardians of the rainforest and opening their lands to commercial activity will speed deforestation of the Amazon.

PARIS (Reuters) - Hitachi's decision to freeze its $28 billion nuclear power project in Britain strengthens the hand of France's EDF (PA:EDF) and its Chinese partner in talks with the government on how to finance new reactors.
Funding new nuclear plants has become critical as Hitachi became the second Japanese firm to say its British nuclear power project had hit the buffers over financing. The two projects would have covered about 13 percent of Britain's power needs.
EDF and its partner China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) want to use a financing model under which investors in their nuclear projects receive payment from the moment they start construction, reducing their risk.
But to proceed with this approach, the government must first win over lawmakers and consumers, already frustrated by hefty energy bills and costly nuclear projects that often face delays.
""The question is whether it is sellable to parliament that all the risks go to the public. But if that is not the case, they will get no investors,"" said Stephen Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University. 
EDF is negotiating with the government on funding the Sizewell C project using the so-called regulated asset base model in which investors earn a government-set fixed return from the start, instead of waiting years until construction is completed before receiving a return.
China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN)  has a 20 percent stake in Sizewell C, while EDF has a 33.5 percent stake in CGN's project to build a reactor at Bradwell, Essex.
""If new nuclear is to be successful in a more competitive energy market – which I very much believe it can be – we need to consider a new approach to financing future projects,"" Energy Secretary Greg Clark told parliament, saying this included Sizewell and Bradwell.
He addressed lawmakers after Hitachi said it had failed to find private equity investors, even though the government had considered partly funding it with taxpayer's money.
That announcement followed Toshiba's (T:6501) decision in November to scrap its NuGen project in Britain after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer for the plan.
DOOMED FROM THE START
Specialists say both projects were doomed from the start.
Only utilities have the steady cash flows to fund such long-term projects, but most European utilities pulled out of Britain's nuclear plans after the 2011 Fukushima disaster led to rising safety costs and as renewable energy became a more competitive investment prospect.
The regulated asset base model may now be one of the few remaining options to fund new nuclear plants in Europe. It is commonly used to fund construction of electricity transmission lines and, in Britain, has been used to fund the Thames Tideway Tunnel, a ""super sewer"" for London.
""Dialogue about a regulated asset base financing model for Sizewell C is progressing,"" an EDF official said. 
But the model has not be used in the nuclear industry, so talks are likely to be tough as the government seeks a clear outline of how much it would have to spend over a specified period and works to avoid writing a blank cheque to cover cost overruns.
The government intends to publish its assessment by the summer at the latest.
For now, the only nuclear plant under construction in Britain is EDF's Hinkley Point C project, in which CGN also has a 33.5 percent stake.
The deal to fund that plant involved EDF taking on the financing and bearing the full risk for construction delays or cost overruns. In return, it was guaranteed a power price of up to 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour for 35 years, more than twice the market rate when signed.
That drew fierce criticism from lawmakers and the public for being too generous and there are no plans to repeat it.
After the Hitachi and Toshiba announcements, the government is now depending on just EDF and CGN to deliver on its plans for a fleet of new reactors to meet energy demand as it phases out old nuclear facilities and coal-fired plants.
""Britain's energy security and decarbonisation strategy are hanging by a thread,"" said French consultant Thibault Laconde.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",Germany should stick to Nord Stream 2 project: MSC chairman,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should finish the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline despite U.S. opposition and growing domestic concerns, but future energy projects should be coordinated by the European Union, a veteran German diplomat said on Thursday.
Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, said the initial ""birth defect"" of the $11 billion project was the fact that European treaties had allowed the German government to deem the project as purely commercial.
In fact, he told reporters, it was clear that such a large project clearly had a political nature, particularly given Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and other actions in recent years.
The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, has been criticized in some quarters because it would deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees, potentially making Kiev more vulnerable in the future.
Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea, but both countries have a common interest in the pipeline, which will double capacity of the current route.
Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) is building the project jointly with Western partners Uniper (DE:UN01), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Engie (PA:ENGIE), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Shell (AS:RDSa). 
Ischinger cautioned against abandoning the project as it neared its completion date of late 2019, citing German foreign policy's focus on consistency and sustainability. ""Saying 'forget it' now would not be good German foreign policy.""
The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, drew fire this week for telling German companies involved in the project that they could face sanctions if they continued with the plan that is already far advanced.

Germany says U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute.

542,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Inverted Yield Curve,"An examination of Eurodollar Futures and Rates plus Treasury Yields indicate an inverted yield curve, says Paul Cretien.
One of the strongest signs of economic weakening and a precursor to a recession is when the yield curve inverts, i.e. short-term interest rate yield more than longer-term interest rates.
Typically analysts use the two-year/10-year interest rate spread, but there are fixed income durations from a few months to 30 years. The charts below show the U.S. Treasury yield curve with Eurodollar rates and yields on Sept. 18, 2017, and Jan.16, 2019. Probably the most important aspect of this illustration is that it shows the yield curve being inverted, with rates and yields declining rather than rising over a future period of approximately four years.
An inverted yield curve is generally caused by the Federal Reserve using higher short-term rates to cool off (that is, slow down) an overheated economy. Since the U.S. economy is currently positive, but not overheated with signs such as high inflation, the development of an inverted yield curve at this time is odd.
Some business enterprises will suffer from an inverted yield curve more than others. For example, banks depend on the spread between low cost rates on deposits and larger intermediate-term rates on bank loans for their basic income. An extended period of inverted yields will not be good for the banking business.
We will present further analysis of this next week."

E-mini S&P (ESH)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at 2613.25, up 7.75
Fundamentals: Yesterday, the S&P notched its highest close since Dec. 13, but pared gains ahead of the bell. Banks were the key driver with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) gaining 9.5% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 7.2% on the heels of earnings. However, it was tech that led profit taking in the last hour on news that a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington introduced a bill that would ban the sale of U.S chips and other components to Chinese companies that violate export control laws such as Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763). Price action has continued to slip a bit overnight but there is certainly no sign of panic. Still, this reinvigorates tensions ahead of a new round of talks between the U.S and China later this month. Furthermore, it was reported this week that U.S Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer saw no progress made on structural issues in the talks last week in Beijing. This aligns with our narrative that there was zero substance in such talks. The Shanghai Composite is only down 0.42% today and Europe has shed roughly the same 0.5%.
After a deluge of positive bank earnings,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) may play spoiler. The stock is down 4% premarket after missing estimates. However, on Tuesday, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was down more than 3% premarket after earnings before finishing in the green. 
U.K Prime Minister May passed her ‘No Confidence’ vote yesterday and essentially finds herself back to where she was coming into this week. Although the hard deadline is still set for March 29, it is expected this can gets kicked down the road. If this does not get extended, we imagine an unpriced shock being brought to global equity markets.
The government shutdown enters its 27th day and stares down the barrel of a 5th week. The economic calendar has been slimmed but what we have gotten has been fairly ugly. On Tuesday, NY Empire State Manufacturing was the worst since May 2017. Both ISMs missed earlier in the month. Today, Philly Fed Manufacturing is due at 7:30 am CST.
Technicals: The Nasdaq 100 Futures (NQH) finished more than 1% from its session high and failed to secure a close above the 50-day moving average, something it has not done since Oct. 4. The S&P 500 traded to a session high of 2626.25 and first key resistance proved a sticking point for the tape. Price action did close out above major three-star resistance at 2603-2609.50; in fact, it spent the whole session out above what we noted as a pivot level yesterday. This will remain a crucial pivot level today as the trend line from the lows we have been referencing aligns perfectly within this pocket today. Last night’s price action has dipped below this line but first key support at 2596.75 has continued to hold. The rally is getting step and the battleground is set. We hold a slight bearish bias and expect price action to again refresh lower at a minimum; this may be as shallow as 2580-2582 and it may not happen today or this week. Major three-star support does not come in until 2547.25-2554.50.

 Crude Oil (CLH)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $52.61, up 22¢
Fundamentals: The March contract is now front-month after February options expiration. Yesterday’s EIA inventory data was not bullish; it posted another massive composite build of 7.787 million barrels. This was more closely in line with the API report Tuesday than the less bearish analyst expectations. There were a couple positives and you don’t have to look further than the headlines. Crude inventories fell by 2.683 million barrels, which was more than expected. Also, Cushing fell by 743,000 barrels; this was only the second draw at the hub in 17 weeks and the first since a measly 116,000 reported on Nov. 21. However, these are offset by an increase in estimated production by 200,000 barrels-per-day in the lower 48 states. Our rhetoric has been, crude cannot maintain price action above $50 unless one of two things happens: Inventories draws begin to trend or fresh jawboning from OPEC. We have gotten neither this week. Fresh tensions on the U.S.-China trade front, discussed in the S&P section, are also weighing on today’s tape. All things considered, we have neutralized our slight bullish bias.
News that OPEC production fell by 751,000 barrels-per-day in December on the heels of their meeting has helped bid the market. Russia is cutting production as planned but there are technical limitations with speed of cuts. Russia and Saudi Arabia plan to discuss cuts further in Davos.
Technicals: We were technically upbeat on crude oil this week as we await the potential development of a bullish cup and handle formation. For now, this potential is neutralized. Our momentum indicator in the March contract comes in at $52.19 and this along with yesterday’s settlement brings a ceiling. Above here, the tape would see a bit of bullish reinvigoration. However, a failure to hold out above here leaves the tape susceptible to waves of selling that could extend as low as $49.10 in the near-term.
Bias: Neutral
Resistance: 52.19-52.61**, 53.61-53.73**, 54.55-54.98**, 55.51-55.55***

Gold (GCV)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $1,293.8, up $5.40
Fundamentals: Gold continues its healthy consolidation at $1,290, just below the psychological $1,300 mark. Price action is seeing slight pressure today after a much better than expected Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, which was some of the first life we have seen in recent Manufacturing data. Additionally, fresh tensions between the U.S and China have weakened the Chinese yuan. This comes after a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington introduced a bill that would ban the sale of U.S chips and other components to Chinese companies that violate export control laws such as Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. Dollar Index is firm and Treasury prices are off their overnight highs. While we remain unequivocally long-term bullish gold and imagine there is much higher to see it on the year, we also hold a narrative of capitalizing on strength so that you can welcome weakness as a buying opportunity.
Technicals: Gold is wedging tighter and tighter on the daily chart and this signals that directional move is coming soon. It may not be until after the February contract expires which is almost two weeks away. Regardless, as we said above, traders should be ready to welcome lower price action as buying opportunity. Today, our momentum indicator comes in at 1292.7; continued price action below here will open the door to another test of key support.
Bias: Bullish/Neutral

544,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Crude Oil is Stuck in The Mud,"The oil market is having a hard time getting anything going lately as bearish and bullish forces are keeping prices locked in a range reports Phil Flynn, Senior Energy Analyst The PRICE Futures Group.
Crude oil is stuck in the mud of politics and conflicting supply and demand signals.
The oil market is having a hard time getting anything going lately as bearish and bullish forces are keeping prices locked in a range. While oil did see a larger than expected 2.7 million-barrel drop in crude supply in the Energy Information Agency (EIA) report and a big 743,000-barrel drop in Cushing Oklahoma, massive builds in products and a drop-in refinery runs raised fears of softening of demand.
The EIA reported that gasoline supply climbed by 7.5 million barrels last week, while distillate stockpiles rose by 3 million barrels. Refinery utilization fell by 1.5 percentage points vs. an estimate of -0.6 percentage points, raising concerns that refiners may be putting on the brakes as product supply starts to build. Yet with that refinery and crude drop it also shows that OPEC cuts are working, and we should see supplies of crude continue to decline even as U.S. production surged by 200,000 barrels a day to 11.9 million, up over 2 million barrels a day from a year ago.
While the shale numbers are impressive, the pullback in investment in shale and rigs probably mean we are close to a short-term peak on those numbers. U.S. refiners, of course, have their fill of the light shale oil and long for those heavier Saudi and Venezuelan barrels that are getting harder to get. U.S. Crude imports fell by 319,000 barrels a day.
Yet with the U.S. government still shut down and the U.S. china trade war not settled, half of the oil trade is either looking at the barrel as half empty while others are looking at it as half full. Fears of a slowdown in the economy is hurting sentiment and the lackluster EIA report did not erase fears of some slowing. Yet with central banks in the U.S., EU and China staying more dovish, it should keep demand strong. The basest slowdown fear surrounding China has been offset by a near record 1.14 trillion-yuan liquid injection into the Chinese economy this week alone. With both China and OPEC doing whatever it takes to support the economy and the price of oil, the bulls win this battle in the end."
545,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",S&P 500 at Turning Point,"The equity rebound may have run its course as the S&P 500 faces numerous technical hurdles, reports Fawad Razaqzada, Technical Analyst FOREX.com.
The U.S. equity markets have started 2019 with a bang, but that good run of form could be about to end. Global stock indices were trading lower this morning, with U.S. index futures also pointing to a lower open on Wall Street when trading gets underway there later. Profit-taking is of course one reason for the weakness in equities today, given the extent of the recent rebound and especially since this week has been very quiet in terms of news flow and data. Investors are also concentrating on other macro events until the focus returns to Brexit when the UK Prime Minister lays out her plan B, by Monday latest.
One area of major concern for investors is weakness in China, where the economic growth has slowed down to 6.5%, the slowest pace since 2009. The slowdown of growth in the world’s second largest economy has been in part due to its trade dispute with the United States, with the latter raising its import tariffs on Chinese goods amid accusations of intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. Although the two nations have started to work on resolving their disputes – which may explain the recent equity market rebound – cracks have nonetheless started to appear in China, with demand for high-end luxury goods, for example, falling. Car sales fell last year for the first time in more than 20 years, while Apple’s warning a couple of weeks ago about weak sales of its iPhone in China is another example.
The damage may have already been done and this could have a negative trickledown effect on the rest of the world, including the U.S. economy. So, while a potential trade resolution could help to prop up the markets, when and if it happens, it could prove to be short-lived as by then the news may have already been priced in. And while the fourth quarter U.S. earnings results have so far been somewhat more positive than negative, bigger and more important companies will be publishing their results and their numbers and outlook could reflect our and other economists’ concerns about China.
Macro view: S&P 500 hits key long-term resistance zone
Meanwhile, from a technical point of view, the global and U.S. stock markets may have already peaked last year, with the major global indices, including the S&P 500, breaking key support levels and forming repeated lower lows and lower highs. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if we do now see a sizeable pullback here after the recent recovery. For one thing, the S&P 500 looks overbought in the short-term outlook, especially in light of the big falls we witnessed at the back end of last year. The index is now retesting the key broken support zone in the 2603-2632 range, as can be seen on the monthly time frame (see chart below). The index has already met with some resistance within this zone yesterday, turning lower from around 2625. If the sell-off at the end of last year marked the end of the bull trend, then this is where the next phase of the selling could potentially start.

Bears need breakdown
Although, as mentioned, the index has now reached a massive area of potential resistance, we must first see a clean breakdown in the lower time frame charts before we turn bearish again. On the daily time frame, one can clearly observe that the most recent low, prior to the latest up move was made at 2567 on Monday. It is therefore this 2567 level that now needs to break for the index to create a lower low. Should this happen, then we could see another sharp sell-off that could potentially move the index, over time, below the 2018 low of 2315. However, there will be other key shorter-term levels, for example at 2521 and 2492, that could prevent that from happening.
Nonetheless, a break below that 2567 would tip the balance back in bears’ favor. For the bulls meanwhile, a clean break through the abovementioned long-term resistance in the 2603-2632 range is needed if we are to see further gains in the near-term outlook. Given the above technical and fundamental considerations, we are doubtful that this scenario will play out. But of course, we could be reading it all wrong. So, let’s let the charts tell us what the next directional move will be, rather than pre-empting it.

546,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Bank of America in Danger Zone,"The QuantCycle indicator shows several markets including BAC in extreme territory on the oscillator, notes John Rawlins.
Normally we bring you the most compelling short- to medium-term QuantCycle charts on a weekly basis to highlight markets that appear to be near a turning point, or exhibiting extreme overbought/oversold characteristics. However, a couple of charts caught our attention, and we decided to share them immediately.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)
A strong fourth quarter earnings report caused Bank of America (BAC) stock to spike 7% on Wednesday. BAC had already staged a strong rally in the first two-weeks of 2019 after setting a 15-month low on Dec. 21. This rally had already put BAC close to overbought territory on the QuantCycle daily chart just as the QuantCycle had BAC turning lower. The Jan. 16 spike blew through overbought territory and the oscillator suggests that BAC could test the Dec. 21 low in the month.
EURGBP (EUR/GBP)
The EUR/GBP pair touched oversold territory on the daily QuantCycle chart just as the oscillator is turning higher.
Silver has already drifted off its early 2019 highs, but it still appears close to overbought territory and the QuantCycle anticipates a sharp sell-off over the next two weeks that could challenge November lows. This would be a $2 move in less than two weeks! While the weekly chart (second chart) is not as bearish, it does show silver in overbought territory.
Mexican Peso (USD/MXN)
The Mexican peso has been gaining ground on the U.S. dollar (forex chart shows decline, meaning peso is gaining value) steadily since December. This has put it in solid oversold territory on the QuantCycle daily chart despite the QuantCycle indicating a reversal around the first of the year. This is an extremely strong signal for the next seven trading days.
The QuantCycle indicator is a technical tool that employs proprietary statistical techniques and complex algorithms to filter multiple cycles from historical data, combines them to obtain cyclical information from price data and then gives a graphical representation of their predictive behavior (center line forecast). Other proprietary frequency techniques are then employed to obtain the cycles embedded in the prices. The upper and lower bands of the oscillator represent a two-standard deviation move from the predictive price band and are indicative of extreme overbought/oversold conditions."
547,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Are we Nearing Another Credit Crisis,"Just because everyone is saying the economy is about to implode, doesn’t mean it won’t. Jeff Greenblatt, Director Lucas Wave International, looks at debt; it’s not a pretty picture.
Last week I mentioned a potential intermediate- to longer-term vibrational change for the bond market; now we are starting to see some follow through. It’s not enough to induce insomnia just yet, but if this seedling grows strong roots, we might be having more serious discussions about interest rates in the not too distant future.
Before I get to the bond market, how are some of the other intermediate to longer term vibrations I’ve covered here working out? Crude oil rallied 25.84% from the low the day before Christmas to the recent high. Now its consolidating. The Aussie Dollar is up 6.1% from its Jan. 2 low, and is now consolidating.
Even as the stock market stays in rally mode and the Fed may turn dovish this year, longer term rates have been in a new bear market since July 2016. My Kairos vibrational/square out work is best viewed in terms of bond prices, and we know interest rates move inversely to pricing. We can see the long bond reversed course on a 29% retracement at 130 weeks off the high (see chart below). The pattern is now working on the second consecutive bearish week. Let’s talk about why this might present a much bigger problem than most people are willing to admit.
I’ve looked around the web and have found a few sites that use the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) as their main source. One of these is the Daily Reckoning. Yeah, I know how some of you feel about Rickards, we know him as the one who has been sounding the alarm for years. I feel the same way about the Armageddon crowd. He was right in 2008. Total global debt is roughly $233 trillion. The global debt to GDP ratio is 318% which is very high and becomes dangerous in a rising rate environment. The BIS numbers have the amount of bank derivatives at $750 trillion. Adding debt and derivatives together that number is around $1 quadrillion. Daniel Estulin has added his own research and some of his work is like a modern version of the Jekyll Island book (first edition 1994) and says the figure is close to $2 trillion when unfunded liabilities are added to the mix. Whichever number is used, it is far greater than the obligations that came due in 2008.
That means if the bear phase that started in 2018 gets another leg down, 2019 may well cause an implosion in the financial system exponentially greater than the one from only 10 years ago. Is it going to happen? For that answer we need to keep a watchful eye on the bond market. The Fed only controls short term rates. They don’t have the same exploding balloon payments that set up the 2008 crash, but if rates accelerate at a rate that can’t be absorbed by the economy, in the very least, the housing and auto markets will come to a grinding halt.
The other problem folks have been agonizing over for several years is student loan debt. According to a Forbes article from June 13, 2018 there are more than 44 million borrowers who owe $1.5 trillion collectively. This figure is higher than both credit card and auto loan debt. Students saddled with debt have a very hard time buying homes. That means a whole generation of young earners won’t buy homes. Do you think the student loan problem and the possibilities for the housing market can be related?
According to ABC News in Tampa Bay, the Florida Board of Health has started suspending health care licenses of healthcare workers that have defaulted on their student loans. There was a clarification to this story, which ran two days ago but the fact is approximately 100 health care workers have lost their license to practice in Florida because they can’t repay their student loans. The Federal student loan companies have been lobbying states for years to punish those who default and Florida is the only state enforcing those laws. These licenses include nurses, pharmacists and opticians. The obvious problem is if folks can’t pay their obligations with a job, how are they going to have a chance if they lose their ability to derive a professional income?
Long term readers to this space know I don’t normally go this route. The experts have been warning about credit bubbles for years yet most of us pay no attention to them. The ability to service debt obligations works just fine while the crowd is in a rising social mood and the stock market stays bullish. It’s when markets rollover we need to be concerned. Estulin states  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in Germany has a gross derivative exposure of $42 trillion in U.S. dollars. The Fed has $56 billion in cash and $21 trillion in debt which is a ratio of 77-1. In Italy 114 out of 500 banks are bankrupt. Last time we were in this position the markets topped in 2007, but took a full year for the crisis to erupt. That was in a period of relative political stability. Now we are dealing with the kind of politics where ideology is king and throws economics under the bus. It’s a vicious cycle.
Right now, the stock market is in rally mode and appears steady. I’m not in the doom and gloom crowd, but given the state of the global debt situation, why get long-term bullish again? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is way down near complacency, it’s a problem given the stock market has barely made it back to the middle of the range. Never forget that in a bear market, surprises come to the downside."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's air safety watchdog on Thursday directed airlines to make extra checks on their Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines as part of new safety protocols after temporary grounding orders affected the planes last year. 
IndiGo, India's biggest carrier by market share, and its low-cost rival GoAir, which fly the A320neos in the country, were forced to ground the aircraft on several occasions due to issues related to the engines. 
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered that airlines must inspect some parts of the 1100 series engines weekly and train the cabin and cockpit crew to deal with and report any kind of odor, burning smell or smoke. 
""Log all the cases detecting odors/smoke in cabin during operation for necessary investigation and rectification,"" the DGCA said in its notification, adding that in all such cases the engine would need to be inspected in detail and used only after the defect is resolved.
IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), and GoAir did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. Airbus and Pratt & Whitney were not immediately reachable. The new rules, which are effective immediately, were issued days after a meeting between the civil aviation ministry, the regulator, the two airlines, aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies (N:UTX) to discuss the issues with the engines. 
""During (the) meeting, it was decided to issue directive in addition to the existing measures related to combustion chambers and No. 3 bearing issues for identifying and correcting impending failures of dry face seal,"" the DGCA said. 
The notification also said there would be restrictions imposed on the operation of A320neo flights to Port Blair - the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands. 

It was not immediately clear whether the regulator planned to restrict all A320neo flights to the islands or only place restrictions on a specific series of the engines that have been found to have issues.

Earlier on Thursday Fitch downgraded Italy's 10th largest lender to 'CCC', saying ""senior creditors face an increased risk of losses now that the bank has been placed under temporary administration as this, in our opinion, reflects a heightened risk of further regulatory intervention.""
Carige said the move showed a ""lack of understanding"" on part of Fitch of what happened to the bank in recent weeks, adding that the support package granted to the lender by the Italian government was given because it was considered solvent for the current year.

 Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) fell 4.5% as analysts sounded the alarm on upcoming earnings, fearing the ongoing slump in memory prices will hurt performance, leading to weaker guidance.
""We’ve clearly misjudged the severity of the downturn in NAND,"" said Wells Fargo.
Wells Fargo cut its price target on Western Digital to $65 from $75, saying weak fundamental trends point to ""ugly"" third-quarter guidance.
The gloomy outlook, as well as expectations for second-quarter earnings to come in at low end of the consensus estimates, was echoed by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Western Digital is slated to release second-quarter results in on Jan. 24, after the closing bell.
Semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), meanwhile, exacerbated concerns about the malaise in semis as it warned first-quarter revenue would fall short of expectations. It blamed a weaker macroeconomic outlook, mobile product seasonality and a glut in inventories in the semiconductor supply chain. Its shares, however, inched 1% higher.
The company reported December-quarter sales of $9.4 billion, slightly above the Wall Street consensus of $9.37 billion. But it also gave a March-quarter revenue guidance range of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion, below estimates of $8 billion.
Still, there's light at the end of tunnel for Taiwan Semi, even as 2019 is set to be a tough year for the company, according to JPMorgan
""We see two silver linings for Taiwan Semi,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said, citing the company's commitment ""to raise cash dividends despite potential for earnings decline"" and a ""strong pipeline for 7nm from second half of 2019 as well as good initial engagement for 5nm."" Both of which should ""cement Taiwan Semis technology leadership in the next few years.""

MADRID (Reuters) - The ECB has expressed concerns over reports that Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) hired a former police chief in 2004 to spy on a would-be buyer and some of its officials have discussed it with the bank, a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
Another source briefed about the case confirmed that top European Central Bank officials were concerned and monitoring the situation, and wanted BBVA to be fully transparent and take any necessary measures.
Last week, online media Elconfidencial.com and Moncloa.com, said that BBVA had hired ex-police chief Jose Manuel Villarejo's firm, Grupo Cenyt, in 2004 to investigate a senior government official and officials of construction company Sacyr (MC:SCYR) as part of efforts to stop a takeover bid.
""The ECB does not like that,"" said one of the two sources. It said officials in a supervisory team had raised the issue with BBVA as part of regular contacts, including the question of the possible reputational risk.
The source said the ECB would not be able to take any action because the officials in charge at the time at BBVA were not in an executive position anymore.
The second source said the ECB, which supervises banks throughout the euro zone, would ask for a ""transparent investigation"" and for the bank to take any necessary measures.
An ECB spokesperson and a BBVA spokesperson both declined to comment. 
BBVA said last week that in June 2018 it started its own investigation into its relations with Grupo Cenyt.
'EXTREMELY SERIOUS'
BBVA executive chairman Carlos Torres on Monday sent a letter to bank employees saying he was shocked by the reports.
""If true, it would be undoubtedly extremely serious, deplorable behavior, radically opposed to what we are and what we stand for, and, ultimately, to the values ​​of BBVA that move us every day,"" he said in the letter, published on the bank's website.
""The investigation so far has verified that Grupo Cenyt carried out different services to the bank, but no documentation has been found related to the monitoring and intervention of private communications that the media has reported since January 9,"" he said, adding the bank had decided to broaden the scope of its probe following the reports.
Francisco González, who was executive chairman at the time, is now honorary chairman. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
Spanish market regulator CNMV told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and the impact it could have.
The situation has also come onto the radar of rating agencies. ""We are monitoring this to see if there is any sanction or any other impact,"" said Luigi Motti of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. 
Sacyr launched a takeover bid for BBVA in 2004 but it was not successful.
Villarejo's lawyer said the former police chief told a court on Thursday in a separate case that he would next week say ""everything he knows,"" including about BBVA.

When asked on Wednesday about the spying reports, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino told reporters: ""Any situation that could harm the reputation of a financial institution is a serious issue, but it is a matter that is handled by judicial investigation, which will determine responsibilities.""

553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 12:52PM ET</span>","John Bogle, Vanguard founder and low-cost investing pioneer, dies at 89","By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - John Bogle, whose family's struggles during the Great Depression led him to pioneer low-cost investing and to found Vanguard Group, now the world's biggest mutual fund firm, died on Wednesday at the age of 89, Vanguard said.
Bogle had been in frail health for years, surviving at least six heart attacks and receiving a heart transplant in 1996. The cause of death was cancer, according to Bogle's assistant Michael Nolan.
Despite ill health, Bogle was a vital presence through his later years as he pressed for reforms in corporate governance and fund administration. 
He often mixed sharp rhetoric with a wry sense of humor and established a reputation as a curmudgeon in his industry, at times at odds with Vanguard executives who eventually stripped him of much of his power within the organization. 
Still Bogle, known widely as Jack, kept deep professional friendships and maintained a loyal following through his books and public speaking appearances. Some termed themselves ""Bogleheads"" in his honor and spread online his messages of thrift and investments in low-fee funds.
""Jack did more for American investors as a whole than any individual I've known,"" billionaire Warren Buffett said in a statement.
At the 2017 annual meeting of his company  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), which Bogle attended, Buffett estimated that by making low-cost index funds so popular for investors, Bogle ""put tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars into their pockets.""
Bogle's life in many ways was the opposite of his great fund industry rival, Edward ""Ned"" Johnson III, who inherited control of Fidelity Investments in Boston from his father and employed star active managers like Peter Lynch. 
Vanguard, in contrast, promoted low-cost index funds, products that Fidelity and the rest of the industry came to emulate.
""He made himself a centurion to the individual investor,"" said Charles Ellis, an industry consultant and a former Vanguard funds director. ""He had one great message, about lowering fees, and he kept hammering away at it.""
MODEST BEGINNINGS 
Bogle was born on May 8, 1929, to a family of modest means in Montclair, New Jersey, and graduated from Princeton University in 1951, working his way through college as a waiter. His economics thesis there earned him a job from an older Princeton alumnus at the Wellington Management Co in Philadelphia. 
Bogle rose through the ranks and persuaded the company to start offering more mutual funds, even as he suffered his first heart attack at the age of 31, in 1960. He had a pacemaker installed in 1967 to treat a condition known as heart arrhythmia. 
He created Vanguard in 1974 after a dispute with others at Wellington, and built its products around a new economic model in which the funds would be run by their own directors and staff rather than by an external management company.
In 1976, Vanguard also introduced the first indexed fund for individual investors. According to the company, it was initially ridiculed as ""un-American"" but now the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (P:VOO) is one of the industry's largest. Vanguard has some $5 trillion in assets under management, the bulk of it in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
Dan Wiener, who runs a newsletter for Vanguard investors, recounted how Bogle once sued him after he disclosed details of Bogle's compensation, and said Bogle could have a thin skin about material that did not ""paint Vanguard as a virtuous non-profit.""
But Wiener said that when he sent a note wishing Bogle well after a 1996 heart transplant, Bogle responded ""in the guise of one of his doctors, who noted that my email had raised his heart rate and that I should refrain from further emails until he was recovered. When I later found out we had a good laugh, at my expense.""
Even as Bogle's health declined in his later years he remained a combative public presence, arguing that larger fund companies had grown too focused on their own profit rather than serving as stewards of their clients' interests, including pressing corporations for better governance. 

""The mutual fund industry lost its way because of the triumph of managers' capitalism over owners' capitalism,"" Bogle wrote in a typically fiery passage in his 2005 book ""The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism.""

(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) quarterly profit fell short of expectations as bond trading revenue slumped more than rivals and its wealth management business faltered, sending its shares down more than 5 percent. 
The bank has pledged that its expansion into wealth management over the past decade would help deliver more stable results. But the unit, which accounts for roughly half of Morgan Stanley's revenue, was not immune from year-end market volatility that drove customers to the sidelines.
 Morgan Stanley  also noted the impact of changes to compensation that addressed what Chief Executive Officer James Gorman called a ""very aggressive"" deferral program. 
Gorman said that Morgan Stanley had been “mortgaging (its) future” by delaying payouts. 
On a call with analysts, Gorman characterized the fourth quarter as a temporary, if disappointing, blip. 
""2018 was a great year that finished on a disappointing note,"" he said. ""We do not believe the fourth quarter is the new normal."" 
Although market volatility hurt trading, underwriting, wealth management and asset management revenue, Morgan Stanley is keeping a tight lid on costs and making purposeful decisions to position itself for growth, he said. 
The bank held its profit margin outlook for wealth management steady at 26 percent to 28 percent through this year. The business had a profit margin of 24 percent in the fourth quarter and 26 percent for all of 2018. Gorman, who has been pressed by analysts to increase that target, cautioned that the current goal is “not a limit” but that the bank is putting revenue growth in that business ahead of profitability for now. 
“The trade-off between revenue growth and margin expansion is important,” he said. “This year, we would be more interested in driving higher revenue growth within this margin range that we've been public on.”
A pay structure for wealth management employees also weighed on the unit during the market slump. 
Morgan Stanley has for years paid its roughly 15,700 brokers a combination of cash up front and stock, which is deferred for several years and invested by the firm. 
The bank reported that net revenues for the current quarter fell to $4.1 billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier because of losses in the investments of some deferred compensation plans. 
Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter pre-tax operating income of $1.9 billion, down 25 percent from the $2.5 billion it reported in the year-earlier period, when changes to U.S. tax law dramatically affected results across Wall Street. 
Its earnings per share of 80 cents missed analysts’ average estimate of 89 cents per share. 
Net revenue fell 10 percent to $8.6 billion, falling well short of the $9.3 billion Wall Street expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income trading revenue fell 30 percent to $564 million. That was a much sharper drop than at rivals, who have bigger bond trading businesses. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) this week reported bond trading revenue declines of 15 percent to 20 percent, blaming a sharp and unexpected widening of credit spreads and volatility in rates trading. 
Revenue from Morgan Stanley's wealth business dropped 6 percent. The unit's profit margin fell to 24 percent from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. 
Investors shifted $121 billion into U.S. money market funds in December, Lipper estimates, the most since November 2008. 
One bright spot in the bank’s results was its M&A advisory business, which delivered a 41 percent rise in revenue. Goldman Sachs also saw similar surge in dealmaking. 
""After strong results from peers yesterday, Morgan Stanley's quarter appears weak, and we expect shares to underperform,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

In the last twelve months, Morgan Stanley's stock has fallen nearly 22 percent, versus a 12.5 percent decline in the financial index (SPSY) and a 5.6 percent drop in the S&P 500 index (SPX) over the same period.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A steep downturn in U.S. ethanol output linked to the trade war with China is raising costs for American farmers who feed a byproduct of the corn-based biofuel to hogs, cattle and chickens.
Sales of the feed, known as distillers' dried grains, or DDGs, were one of the bright spots for ethanol makers such as Green Plains Inc (O:GPRE),  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO)  and Pacific Ethanol Inc (O:PEIX) after China all but stopped buying corn ethanol, contributing to oversupply.
But now cuts to ethanol production are tightening supplies of DDGs and raising prices paid by livestock farmers. Many are turning to other feeds including soybean meal, the price of which eased as China halted imports of American soybeans. 
While soymeal is more expensive than DDGs, it is also more nutritious for livestock and therefore more cost-effective at current prices.
The shift away from DDGs is another blow to a struggling biofuel sector. Robust demand for DDGs had been a buffer as the lowest ethanol prices in over a decade dragged on the industry.
The Maschhoffs, the largest U.S. family-owned pork producer, roughly halved DDG use from the autumn to December due to routine cost assessments, nutrition director Omarh Mendoza said. DDGs formerly accounted for up to 30 percent of hogs' rations, he said, but the Carlyle, Illinois-based company now is using more corn and soymeal instead.
""A lot of ethanol is not being produced and therefore there's not a whole lot of product out there,"" Mendoza said about DDGs.
Ethanol makers slashed production rates last year due in part to negative profit margins, according to the companies and traders. 
Green Plains, the fourth largest U.S. producer, also put several plants up for sale, complaining of burdensome biofuel supplies. The cuts in output pushed up prices of DDGs and prompted switching to soymeal, company spokesman Jim Stark said.
Still, more reductions in ethanol output were necessary as supplies continued to outpace demand, Stark added. 
U.S. ethanol inventories this month climbed to a near-record of over 23 million barrels even as output slowed to the lowest in over six months, Energy Information Administration data showed.
Prices for DDGs in the eastern half of Iowa, the top ethanol producing state, surged to $180 per ton in December, the highest in 3-1/2 years, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Meanwhile, soymeal prices in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were more stable, averaging $283 per ton last month. 
Soymeal has more protein than DDGs, making it more expensive. However, in Cedar Rapids, soymeal's premium to DDGs reached just $103 per ton in mid-December, the smallest since 2012, the data showed.
The shift from DDGs is largely in the hog sector, a DDGs trader working for a publicly traded company said. Cattle generally are not fed as much soymeal and need fiber from DDGs, he said.
Hog producers are cutting the percentage of DDGs in their rations to as little as 10 percent from 30 percent due to high prices, said swine nutritionist John Goihl, who owns 3-D Nutrition Services in Shakopee, Minnesota.
Farmers are reluctant to abandon DDGs completely because they provide energy, amino acids and phosphorus important for healthy animals, he said, meaning that producers absorb some of the price increase.
""They'll stay at the lower levels unless this DDG price relationship really gets out of hand,"" Goihl said.
China, formerly the top importer of both DDGs and ethanol, last year stopped buying U.S. products due to the trade war. 
Thailand recently halted imports of U.S. DDGs, too, over concerns about beetles found in two shipments. U.S. exports of DDGs have remained robust elsewhere in Asia and in Mexico. 

""DDGs had really helped keep the ethanol industry going when ethanol prices were low, and supplement margins,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for U.S. broker INTL FCStone.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concern over China's economic outlook and global trade left major world stock indexes little changed on Thursday, while an end to the latest chapter in Britain's exit from the European Union helped to stabilize sterling.
Disappointing earnings in the U.S. from  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), hot on the heels of similarly weak numbers from  JP Morgan Chase  (N:JPM) earlier in the week, hurt sentiment on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley shares slumped more than 5 percent.
Gains in U.S. healthcare and consumer discretionary shares offset the losses, leaving the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 equity index nearly flat.
Investors have been worried, too, that the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on the U.S. economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week that it continues.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 27.31 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,179.85, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 3.06 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,619.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 9.39 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,044.08.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.08 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.03 percent.
CHINA
Some investors took heart from Beijing's confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will head to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington. Recent talks to resolve a protracted trade battle between the U.S. and China brought little progress. 
Adding to recent worries was news that U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei  or other Chinese telecoms firms that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.
""Concerns about trade policy have been simmering there for a while,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses.
European banks tumbled (SX7E) after France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) issued a profit warning, and carmakers (SXAP) skidded after U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought President Donald Trump was ""inclined"" to impose tariffs on European cars.
STERLING 
Sterling  firmed toward a two-month high against the dollar. It was trading 0.3 percent up at $1.292, inching toward a mid-November high of $1.293.
As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won a confidence vote overnight and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit agreement.
An outline for Plan B https://reut.rs/2TVKYfe is due by next Monday and markets are currently assuming that with no easy way forward for May she will have to extend the date of Britain's exit from the European Union past the scheduled March 29.
U.S. Treasury yields ticked up as better-than-expected economic data offset the trade tensions between China and the United States, holding down safe-haven bids for U.S. government debt.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.7378 percent, from 2.729 percent late on Wednesday.
Oil prices fell after U.S. crude production neared an unprecedented 12 million barrels per day (bpd).
Brent crude (LCOc1) was last down $0.82, or 1.34 percent, at $60.5 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) was last down $1.22, or 2.33 percent, at $51.09 per barrel.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Siemens-Alstom rail merger is creating European tensions,"By Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) agreed in 2017 to merge their rail assets, hoping to create a European industrial champion. But the EU's competition authority has doubts about the deal and could turn it down, despite the companies offering to take steps to clinch it.
Siemens said on Thursday it was not prepared to make further concessions, meaning the merger's fate now likely rests in the hands of the European Commission, whose 28 commissioners are themselves split on the issue.
The Commission has not commented publicly on its deliberations, beyond saying it will take a decision by Feb. 18.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned the EU's executive of a grave political error if it rejects the deal.
His outspoken intervention reflects a frustration in Paris and some other European capitals that the EU's competition laws no longer reflect modern-day geopolitical realities, and in particular the threat from China.
WHAT'S THE LATEST?
Sources said Siemens planned no further concessions after it already offered to license parts of its high-speed train business and sell parts of its signaling operations to allay the EU antitrust concerns.
For its part, Alstom said it considered the proposed concessions already on the table ""appropriate and adequate"" to get the deal approved.
The merger would create the world's second largest rail company, with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros ($17 billion). That is roughly half the size of China's state-owned CRRC Corp Ltd (SS:601766) but twice the size of Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb). 
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager worries the merger would stifle Europe's rail industry and has voiced doubts that China is likely to be a competitor on European railways in the near future.
WHY IS IT SO POLITICALLY CHARGED?
French President Emmanuel Macron champions a ""Europe that protects"". That includes protecting citizens from the threat to European jobs from Chinese firms. Europe, he says, needs to create industrial giants, like planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), to ensure its firms are not squeezed out of their own market.
The Commission bases its judgment on EU competition law - ensuring that consumers have a choice that maintains downward pressure on prices in the European market.
A weakness of the EU is its faith in an international rules-based system, especially when others violate it, French officials say.
By applying its antitrust rules to the letter, the EU may end up benefiting China more than its own economic area, the French argue.
At the same time, officials in Brussels question whether bending competition rules to forge European champions is the best way to rein China in or teach it a lesson.
In a sign of the Commission's splits, the French and German commissioners are speaking up internally about the need to take the Chinese threat into account in deciding whether the Siemens-Alstom merger would hurt competition, European officials say.
Several national regulators have opposed the deal or raised doubts about it, as have unions at the companies, making it hard for the Commission to overlook concerns.
ARE THE EU LAW'S OUTDATED?
France's Le Maire says Europe needs to wake up, branding its competition laws ""obsolete"". 
One German official said the Commission struggled to see beyond the EU market: ""They haven't understood the way China works ... (it) is not a market economy. There's this EU bubble thing, they haven't seen the global tectonic shifts."" 
Vestager says European champions cannot be built by undermining competition, and questions whether using competition policy is the best way to alter China's behavior. 
French officials acknowledge the debate is one that will not be resolved before a decision on Siemens-Alstom is due, meaning the deal may end up becoming collateral damage.
AREN'T MACRON AND VESTAGER POLITICAL ALLIES?
With a high profile in Brussels for attacking tax avoidance and monopoly powers among U.S. multinationals, Vestager is widely talked about as a liberal who could win support beyond her party as the next Commission president.
The former Danish economy minister hasn't announced any public bid for the job, but if she does she would likely need the backing of Macron, another liberal, whose party will compete in May's European elections for the first time.
If she ultimately rejects the Siemens-Alstom deal, it might taint her relations with Macron. Even so, French officials acknowledge that she has every reason to want to protect her reputation for applying the EU's rules firmly and fairly, earned via investigations into Google (O:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  over taxes, no matter what the political cost.
WHAT DOES THIS LEAVE THE MERGER?
Tom Pick, a competition expert at law firm Fieldfisher in Brussels, said he had heard no noises from Vestager that suggested she had changed her mind as a result of the concessions offered by the companies.
""From what I see, what they are probably going to say is a prohibition, unless they have decided to market test again and have come to a different view,"" Pick said.

The Commission will take a decision in a ""collegial"" manner involving all 28 commissioners, one nominated from each member state. As the commissioner responsible for competition, Vestager has a very strong say but the process of arriving at a collective decision can be opaque.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",EU takes aim at Turkish steel sector already buckling under Trump tariffs,"By Maytaal Angel and Ceyda Caglayan
LONDON/ANKARA (Reuters) - The European Commission's move to extend its steel import restrictions threatens to force Turkish mills, already buckling under the weight of U.S. tariffs, to cut production further or in some cases close down, sources said.
The Commission said on Wednesday it will extend and beef up its existing ""safeguard"" steel import caps until July 2021 to counter concerns that European Union markets are being flooded with steel no longer being exported to the United States.
For Turkey's vast steel sector, the fourth largest contributor to the country's economy, the caps could prove particularly painful as the EU has given it additional ""country-specific"" quotas.
Under the safeguards, Turkey has a tariff-free quota for rebar, a construction steel that makes up most of its steel exports, of around 300,000 tonnes for the first nine months of the respective quota periods, down 60 percent from its 2018 exports.
Country-specific restrictions do not apply in the last three months of the quota periods and Turkey could make up some sales then, but its annual export levels will still be sharply lower.
""Our export markets have disappeared, the local market hardly exists, we've got lots of capacity and no market,"" said a London-based Turkish steel trader. 
He added that hopes the United States would soon cut its 50 percent tariff on Turkish steel imports were also fading given it is demanding that in return, Ankara hold fire on Kurdish forces in Syria, something Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan cannot do ahead of local elections. 
Major Turkish mills such as Cebitas and Ekinciler said they had, before the EU announcement, already slashed output while Koc Metalurji said it had stopped output for about a month.
Erdemir, Turkey's largest producer, said it was producing as normal.
Jefferies estimates EU caps on rebar from all countries combined should reduce its total rebar imports by at least 28 percent a year, adding producers such as ArcelorMittal and CMC should benefit most from EU caps on long products like rebar.
""(EU) quotas for (Turkish) rebar are extremely low and will be exceeded in the first one or two months. Local demand is also extremely poor,"" said Turkish Steel Exporters' Association (CIB) head Adnan Aslan.
The CIB estimated late last year, before the latest EU move, that Turkey's steel production, consumption and exports would fall 30 percent this year.
Wednesday's beefed up EU safeguards come after the United States early last year placed tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel, while singling out Turkey later in the year with tariffs of 50 percent due to political tensions with Ankara.
The United States had been Turkey's largest steel export destination in 2017, but the country's steel flows to the EU ballooned 80 percent last year, according to Jefferies, making the EU Turkey's the largest steel export destination.

""Traditional export destinations (for Turkish mills) are closing one after the other. Most probably, the (EU) quotas will be filled immediately, so EU producers will have a relatively good year,"" the International Rebar Producers and Exports Association said in a note.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille are snapping up stakes in their franchised shops, seeking to tighten their grip on the sales network as a growing number of top brands ditch wholesalers.
Changes to distribution for luxury watches have lagged sectors such as groceries or fashion, with eye-watering price tags seen as a barrier to buying online and favoring a more traditional sales approach. 
But trouble clearing excess inventory at multi-brand watch retailers, and the lure of better margins, is persuading some labels to cut their reliance on the third-party resellers that still account for around 75 percent of industry sales, according to analysts. 
Family-owned Audemars Piguet, which has said it aimed to have only monobrand stores in three to five years' time, is also investing in some of the around 30 franchises that already carry its name.
Out of a total 200 points of sale, it has 60 monobrand outlets but only 25 are fully-owned for now. The company is taking a majority stake in a Los Angeles franchise in an example of efforts to better control its image, Chief Executive Francois-Henry Bennahmias told Reuters. 
""Between our stores in Rome and New York City a client could hear slightly different narratives, and we can't afford that,"" Bennahmias said at the SIHH trade fair in Geneva this week.
KNOWING THE CUSTOMER
The shift in-house is not universal, with giants like privately-owned Rolex and Patek Philippe staying the course with multi-brands.
For their part, some smaller independent brands simply cannot afford the higher fixed cost and ensuing risk attached to monobrand stores. 
But  Richemont  (S:CFR), owner of the Cartier and IWC brands, is among those moving more stores in-house at some of its labels. Sixty-three percent of its revenue comes from its own shops, up from 42 percent a decade ago.
Audemars said its strategy was boosting sales. These grew 10 percent last year to 1.1 billion Swiss francs ($1.11 billion) - with half coming now from monobrand stores. 
""It's huge. It's the point of no return,"" Bennahmias said. 
Ultra high-end Richard Mille, with average prices of around 180,000 euros ($205,236), already derives 75 percent of sales from its 40 monobrand boutiques, many of which are franchises it has invested in, marketing director Tim Malachard said. 
Launched in 2001, the label aimed to eventually phase multi-brand retailers out - it sells via 44 now - and reach 50 to 55 single-brand stores, he added. 
""It allows us to get to know our clients. And there is no discounting,"" Malachard said. 
SURVIVORS
The industry is still reeling from a downturn, after a crackdown on luxury gift giving in China and the collapse of Hong Kong's market that has taken time to recover. 
That pushed brands like Cartier into buying back stocks languishing at distributors in recent years, to stop them being dumped at discounted prices on the so-called ""gray"" market. 
While momentum has recovered - in spite of renewed concerns about a Chinese slowdown - firms are also tussling over how to attract younger consumers who grew up using smartphones rather than watches. 
""Clients want to buy watches but they also want an experience,"" said Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot. It is cutting back on wholesalers too, though it expects them to still make up half of sales in the long term. 
""The multi-brand retailers that used to stock 50 labels are disappearing little by little, only the big players will be left,"" Guadalupe said. 
For some small watchmakers, however, solo stores are an unaffordable gambit. 
""Smaller independent brands cannot do without wholesale distributors,"" said Marco Tedeschi, CEO of Switzerland's RJ, which plans to produce 1,200 pieces this year, including some themed around Batman villains. 
RJ is however switching to distributors stocking fewer brands, which might do more to help promote its watches, Tedeschi added. 
MB&F, which makes 250 of its futuristic timepieces a year, now reaps up to a quarter of sales through a handful of art gallery joint ventures, from Geneva to Dubai - providing it with another way of reaching customers, said communications head Charris Yadigaroglou. 

""Not all of the retailers will survive,"" he added.

Carige could raise up to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in several bond issues if it gets the guarantee, which would mark a major about-face by the ruling coalition which has criticized previous governments for intervening to help troubled banks.
The European Commission, which oversees state aid rules in the European Union, has been notified of the request for a state guarantee, Tria added during a parliamentary hearing.
""We're confident of receiving a response soon"" he said.
Genoa-based Carige could launch a state-backed bond as soon as next week, daily newspaper Milano Finanza reported earlier on Thursday. The issue's size could top one billion euros with a three-year maturity and a yield of around 2.5 percent, the report added.
Italy's populist government has set up a 1.3 billion euro fund to support Carige after the European Central Bank (ECB) put the bank under temporary administration, following a failed attempt to raise capital from investors.
The money in the fund set up by the government could also be used for a so-called precautionary recapitalization - an injection of capital into a troubled bank that can be permitted under EU rules if the lender is solvent. 
That is what happened with Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), which was bailed-out by the government in 2016.
Tria, however, described that scenario as an ""absolutely last resort option"".
""If the conditions for such an intervention were to materialize, it would be necessary to start a dialogue with European authorities,"" the finance minister said.

The tentative contract with the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, which represents 2,500 pilots, boosts pay, changes the compensation structure, and expires in 2026.
NetJets and the union said in a joint statement on Thursday that the accord followed six weeks of talks, which the Columbus, Ohio-based company began though the pilots' 2015 contract wasn't scheduled to expire until 2023.
More than 81 percent of the pilots voted last month in favor of the changes.
""The NJASAP Executive Board is exceedingly pleased with the outcome of this negotiation -- an ambitious undertaking characterized by honesty, goodwill and a genuine commitment to continuing collaboration,"" said union president, Pedro Leroux.
The contract was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NetJets' labor peace contrasts with more than two years of contentious relations with the union that ended in 2015, after Adam Johnson was installed as chief executive.
The union, then also led by Leroux, had accused NetJets of trying to slash jobs, obtain givebacks on health care and work rules, and bait pilots through bogus Twitter posts to conduct work slowdowns that could result in their being fired.
In contrast, Johnson said on Thursday the contract extension was ""built on a foundation of trust and transparency.""
Berkshire employed more than 377,000 people at the end of 2017, and most are not unionized.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Shutdown is starting to hurt Trump's financial deregulation agenda,"By Pete Schroeder, Suzanne Barlyn and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government shutdown over President Donald Trump's call for Congress to fund a wall he promised to build on the U.S.- Mexican border is threatening another campaign pledge to make rules easier to navigate for banks and corporations. 
The partial shutdown, sparked by a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over how to address Trump's demand, is already the longest ever, entering its 27th day on Thursday with no signs of a resolution.
The Trump administration has outlined plans to ease bank rules, overhaul corporate governance, and boost financial innovation, sparking hopes among executives that they would already start to feel the benefits this year.
Yet with Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the 2020 presidential campaign expected to stymie policymaking, industry lobbyists worry the shutdown will further limit the narrow window for the new rules to kick in.
Of particular concern is the fate of rules being penned by regulators to implement changes, passed by the Republican Congress last May, that relaxed restraints imposed on banks after the financial crisis, said lobbyists and regulatory sources.
Republican lawmakers had expected many of those changes would be close to the finish line by now, but several have yet to be put to public comment. This step, among others, is part of a strict rule-changing process dictated by federal law that cannot be easily expedited once the government reopens. 
Given many of the changes face opposition from consumer groups, lawyers say any hiccups in their implementation could expose them to litigation and delay them indefinitely.
“While there is an image of folks coming in and cutting red tape, for better or worse that is not the way our legal process works and the government shutdown really impedes that process,” said Ben Olson, a lawyer with Buckley Sandler who previously worked for several agencies including the Federal Reserve.
At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), whose budgets are set by Congress, less than a tenth of staff continue to work in areas such as law enforcement, market surveillance and investor protection while all non-emergency rule-making is suspended.
The CFTC, for example, was scheduled to agree rules that would pave the way for Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE) to begin trading digital currency futures in coming weeks, but that timeline is now unrealistic, according to a person familiar with the CFTC's original plan.
With no SEC staff available to approve paperwork, initial public offerings are getting backed up, said lawyers. Brokers are also unable to get critical guidance on whether some trades are compliant, said Marlon Paz, a Washington-based lawyer who advises financial firms. ""I fear there is little oversight in tumultuous times.""
Although the three banking regulators are funded independently, lobbyists say the shutdown may derail their work on rule changes overseen jointly with the SEC and CFTC. That includes the ""Volcker Rule"", which imposed curbs on banks' proprietary trading as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
U.S. and international banks have criticized the rule as too burdensome and lobbied hard for changes, but the five financial regulators are obliged to review thousands of pages of comments before taking further action. With CFTC and SEC policy staff barred from even checking their emails, however, these types of joint projects are stalled. 
""They still have to review all comments, and the folks who have to review them are at home watching TV,"" said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president at trade group the American Bankers Association. 
""Our worry is that the shutdown could be slowing down the process.""
A CFTC spokeswoman confirmed the agency has halted all rule-writing. An SEC spokesman said the SEC was staffing emergency functions.
Furloughs at the Office of the Federal Register, which must formally publish all steps in the rule-writing process, have also delayed other changes Congress agreed in May, public records show.
For example, days before the shutdown began on Dec. 22, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Fed, alongside other agencies, unveiled two proposals to ease rules on broker deposits and community banks.
But those have yet to be published in the register, which is required to start public comment periods.
Bridget Dooling, a research professor at George Washington University, said the law allowed few shortcuts, meaning a backlog created now would likely not get cleared for months.
""Losing a month or two months or, who knows, maybe more from your productive timeline could ultimately jeopardize your ability to finish the work you set out to do in a presidential administration,” said Dooling, who previously worked in the regulatory office at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. 

Spokespeople for the FDIC and Fed declined to comment. The Office of the Federal Register was not able to respond to requests for comment due to the shutdown.

587,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank's Path to a Game-Changing Merger Just Got Bumpier,"(Bloomberg) -- Finding a merger partner for  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) was never going to be easy, and now some key power players in German finance are making it even more complicated.
On one side, influential figures in the government favor a tie-up with smaller domestic rival  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) to create a national banking champion with the size and scope to accompany German exporters around the world. It’s an enticing project for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which owns 15 percent of Commerzbank and is keen to fortify the country’s financial sector before another downturn hits.
On the other side, key regulators -- including the European Central Bank and German banking watchdog BaFin -- worry about the risks of combining the country’s biggest banks, which are both struggling with weak share prices and low profitability, according to people familiar with the matter. Also, the ECB sees a chance that a cross-border deal involving Germany’s largest lender could spur more integration in Europe’s fragmented financial landscape, the people said.
Stuck somewhere in the middle is Christian Sewing. The Deutsche Bank chief executive officer quietly favors a European merger, but wants time to revive the company’s earnings and share price before considering a deal. The good news is that Deutsche Bank stock has rallied 15 percent since the start of this year after a rocky 2018.
The differing opinions on a merger show how complex it will be to secure backing from decision makers while also allaying concerns among employees, clients and counterparties that its turnaround is on track. On top of the delicate political maneuvering, there’s the challenge of combining the giant German lender’s operations with those of a domestic or European competitor.
While a deal with Commerzbank might be a quicker solution, it would carry “significant execution risk,” Magdalena Stoklosa, a London-based analyst with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), wrote in a note Thursday reacting to Bloomberg’s story on how Deutsche Bank regulators view a potential deal. What’s more, Deutsche Bank would need to raise as much as 9 billion euros ($10 billion) to pull off the combination.
Meanwhile, a cross-border merger would require “enhanced clarity” on the Europe Union’s plans for banking union, which “would take a few years to play out,” she wrote.
During strategy meetings in September, Deutsche Bank executives concluded that a merger with Swiss competitor UBS Group AG was the most favorable option among potential European partners, though they determined that the time isn’t right, people familiar with the matter have said.
BaFin’s analysis, which was relayed to Germany’s Finance Ministry, came to a similar conclusion, according to people familiar with the matter. The evaluation and a series of high-level meetings reflect a growing sense of urgency as German decision makers fret that the country’s biggest banks could struggle to weather the next crisis without outside help.
“A merger with any bank would be a mammoth project,” said Philipp Haessler, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Pareto Securities who has a hold recommendation on both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. “Deutsche Bank is already busy.”

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",Wall Street's Faith in Its Earnings Prescience Near Record High,"(Bloomberg) -- Despite a trade war, all the whiplash stock volatility and the drama in the White House, securities forecasters have almost never been this confident they know exactly what companies will report this earnings season.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) charts a measure of Wall Street unanimity it calls analyst clustering, looking at the degree to which profit estimates for individual companies deviate from each other. It was at a record level of tightness headed into the third-quarter season, during which equities lurched, and it hasn’t loosened up much headed into the current reporting season.
That could mean fireworks for companies that do anything unexpected. Take banks, which started the season with a slew of positive surprises. Shares of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) jumped at least 7 percent Wednesday, their best earnings reactions in at least seven years.
Good news for bulls. But anyone who endured the turbulence during the last reporting season knows consensus is a double-edged sword. Misses could be punished, in a big way. In fact, taken together -- both up and down moves -- earnings-day turbulence in individual companies late last year reached the highest since Leuthold Group began tracking the data in 1999.
“Nobody has any incentives to make an outlier call because if you’re wrong, your career is over,” John Goltermann, president at Highgate Securities Investments in Colorado, said by phone. “Surprises will be larger and more frequent, and we’ll probably see more market volatility as a result. It makes people a little more on edge.”
Of course, big moves are easier to take when they’re up. But in a bull market where corporate results have often been an anchor of calm, it’s noticeable when earnings start to create volatility. Particularly right after the S&P 500 plunged to its worst December since the Great Depression and then rallied back to the second-best start of a year in three decades.
Options traders are preparing for turbulence in single stocks. While the relative cost of protecting against swings in the broader market has fallen, for the average stock, it’s rising, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs. The implied earnings-day move for S&P 500 companies averaged 7.4 percent this reporting season, the highest since the second quarter of 2009.
Why analyst estimates are so clustered is debatable, but one theory links the phenomenon to growing macro gloom that makes forecasting business trends a harder task. The idea is, as things get more uncertain, the tendency toward groupthink increases. From lingering U.S.-China trade tensions to a government shutdown in Washington, Brexit to Federal Reserve monetary policy, things that underpin the global economy are murkier than ever.
BofA’s measure of analyst dispersion hit a 18-year low of 5.2 percent in October and has since risen to 5.6 percent. Still, that’s well below the long term average of 9.6 percent. To strategist Savita Subramanian, the homogenization sets the stage for stock picking.
“If low dispersion reflects a reluctance to diverge from the pack, which we think is likely, our work suggest that focusing on out-of-consensus earnings calls should be rewarded,” she wrote in a note to clients. “Earnings season is a good time to be a stock picker.”
Analysts have been busy cutting their estimates as companies from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). to Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and Macy’s Inc. issued sales or profit warnings. At 12 percent, fourth-quarter profit growth from S&P 500 firms is expected to slow to half the pace from the previous three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The deceleration will worsen this year, with profits increasing no more than 4 percent in the first two quarters.
Marko Kolanovic, a strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), observed a pattern so far this reporting season, where individual stocks fell in initial reaction post earnings but managed to end the day higher. To him, it’s a sign that share prices may have reflected concerns over a profit slowdown. After the fourth-quarter sell-off that erased $5 trillion from equity values, almost all hedge funds tracked by the firm held exposure to stocks that’s well below the historic average.
“Risks around the upcoming earnings season are balanced,” he wrote in a note. “On one hand, we could see further downside for Q1 guidance, but on the other hand, already reduced expectations and low positioning can result in upside moves.”

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",BBBs Are Back in Style as `Fallen Angels' Freakout Fades Away,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are showing renewed appetite for the riskiest investment-grade debt as fears about a flood of “fallen angels” tumbling into junk prove overblown.
Bonds rated BBB -- the lowest ratings tier above junk -- by at least one ratings agency have comprised two-thirds of new supply in the investment-grade market in the first 11 trading days of the year, a drastic reversal from last quarter’s BBB presence of less than one half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
December was the slowest month for issuance since 1995 as volatile equity markets and weaker macro sentiment overshadowed funding needs. The U.S.-China trade war, the Federal Reserve considering more rate hikes in 2019, and a misalignment between monetary policy in the U.S. and abroad all contributed a less supportive environment for credit.
In the same period, credit spreads, the additional premium above Treasuries investors pay to hold riskier debt, widened 16 basis points, and high-grade bond funds experienced four straight weeks of outflows, according to Lipper Fund flows data.
Analysts have become more positive about investment-grade credit since then. On Jan. 4, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). strategists moved U.S. high-grade to overweight from underweight, adding they were particularly bullish on BBB’s.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also recently reevaluated its somewhat bearish position, recommending that investors add some credit risk as the “short-term risk/reward in U.S. credit has improved notably.” These revisions come after the bank’s strategists repeatedly warned investors about a potential fallout in the BBB space last quarter.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc’s Jes Staley echoed these concerns in November, saying on Bloomberg Television that regulators should focus on of the corporate debt market’s “fallen angels” problem.

Investors, it seems, have also become less bearish. The recent flood of BBB deals were met with strong demand, allowing borrowers to secure lower overall funding costs. Fox Corporation, a spin-off from 21st Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX). assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, saw orders that were as much as nine times the size of one of its tranches for its Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. acquisition-related bond sale. Subscription rates, on average, were six times the total deal size of $6.8 billion.
""The fact of the matter is, companies are still able to bring deals, there’s still demand, and we’re running ahead of last year’s pace in terms of total new issuance,"" said Zachary Chavis, portfolio manager at Sage Advisory Services said in a phone interview.
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, rated three notches above junk by Moody’s, had similar results on its $15.5 billion offering, attracting orders in excess of about $40 billion, roughly 2.7 times over the deal size.
“The fact that you have big deals, notably Anheuser-Busch after a downgrade, and that it was very well subscribed is a testament to the fact that good issuers still have market access,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Noel Hebert in a phone interview.
These borrowers’ success came at the same time investors were focused on macro news headlines that have been affecting markets: the longest-ever government shutdown, the rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, a more dovish Fed, and earnings from Wall Street’s biggest banks. That may be a signal that there is a disconnect between the credit market and the broader market. Credit metrics have also somewhat recovered from a fourth-quarter rout, though investment-grade spreads remain near two-year wide levels and outflows came in at $1.1 billion last week.
If the U.S. investment-grade primary market is one of the ""key drivers of what credit does in January,"" then investors’ willingness to buy what one group of strategists calls ""bad boy bonds"" amid a turbulent macro backdrop is a positive sign for credit markets.
Even with the improvements, some still have reservations. The concern over fallen angels “is still there over the long-term,” said Chavis.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:52AM ET</span>",Trading operations stung banks in fourth quarter but dovish Fed fuels hope,"By Sinéad Carew and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - Big trading operations were a thorn in the side of the top U.S. banks in the fourth quarter as fears about global growth sent credit markets into a tailspin, but a ""dovish"" turn from the Federal Reserve may mean the drama is over for now.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) all reported declines in fourth-quarter revenue from their key fixed income, commodity and currency trading arms, although overall results at most were cushioned by improving loan growth and net interest margins.
The final months of 2018 were dominated by investor worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute and were further aggravated by concerns that the Fed might be pushing interest rates too high. The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks' own books.
""You had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn't have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,"" said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.
Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML index data.
Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees.
As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street's biggest players.
Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs' bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion.
In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses.
But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth.
At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients ""remained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions."" Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter.
After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here.
That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter.
The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML's high-yield index.
The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday.
Even as ""the potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,"" said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. ""This has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month/quarter.""
But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse.

""That could change tomorrow,"" said Sandler O'Neill's Harte. ""That's the trouble with trading revenues, they're awfully volatile. But at least today the first quarter is looking a lot better than the fourth.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Germany and China are working on ways to improve market access for each other's banks and insurers, the German finance minister said on Thursday, and he welcomed plans by China and the United States to ease trade tensions through talks.
Germany and China both want to signal that the world remains multilateral and that all countries are trying to cooperate, said Olaf Scholz, who is on a two-day visit to Beijing.
The two countries are expected to sign agreements on Friday to expand cooperation in financial services. The agreements are part of Scholz's effort to convince China that opening its economy is in its own interest.
""This is especially important for the financial sector,"" Scholz told reporters, adding that the talks in Beijing were aimed at improving market access for German banks and insurers in China and the other way around.
""This will lead to more wealth on both sides,"" Scholz said.
Scholz will meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday. Both are expected to attend a ceremony where Germany's financial- market regulator, Bafin, will sign two agreements with Chinese authorities, a German government official said.
The first agreement is with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and the second with China's Securities Regulatory Commission, the official said. A third agreement may be concluded between China and Germany's Bundesbank, he said.
Scholz is also campaigning for Germany to become a hub for Chinese and renminbi-denominated financial products in Europe, after Britain's exit from the European Union.
During a panel discussion at a university in Beijing, Scholz urged China to share more information about its lending in other countries to increase debt transparency. China has become one of the largest lenders in emerging markets, but it is not a member of the Paris Club of government creditors.
Turning to the trade dispute between China and the United States, Scholz said that the latest round of talks was a good sign and he hoped that the negotiations were successful.
""It is good that patience is paying off and that there are signs that there are further talks between China and the United States,"" Scholz said.

Liu will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday.

597,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Azure Power AZRE,"Given its 300 sunny days per year, India is ideally situated for solar power and the largest solar utility company operating there is our speculative pick, explains Vivian Lewis, and international specialist focused on ADRs and editor of Global Investing.
Setting up in business in India itself is sufficiently daunting that my corporate choice, Azure Power (AZRE), is incorporated in Mauritius. It was the first renewable energy company to list in 2016 when it did its initial public offering in October, raising $161 million.
The stock is our top 2019 speculation for growth. The founder and CEO since 2008 is a Silicon Valley professional of Indian heritage, Inderpreet Singh Wadhwa. His father Harkanwal is a director and chief operating officer. Most of the other brass are outsiders.
Azure Power is an integrated project developer which offers guaranteed long-term electricity prices, whatever happens in to oil. It bids for government supported sites like railway station rooftops with a very sharp pencil thanks to a decade of experience and over 3 dozen plants.
It also tapped the “green bond” market with success in 2017 and again this year with many of the same lenders. It builds solar parks. Its solar tariffs are close to grid parity in many areas. It aims to generate 5 gigaWatts by the end of 2020.
Azure Power uses an Indian fiscal year (to March 31) and in its Q2 this year sales rose 22% to INR 2,225.7 billion rupees and operating income rose 20% to INR 1,210.2 billionn rupees. Adjusted EBITDA hit INR 1,807.7 billion ($25 million), up 21% from Q2 2017-8.
The net loss was INR 297.6 billion vs a loss in the prior Q2 of INR 1,240.5 billion. The loss per share was 11 rupees vs a loss of 42 a year before. Azure makes solar power generating facilities but it doesn't yet make money. Moreover, India charges income tax at about 20% which adds to losses.
By the end of this FY, Azure expects to put an additional 1300-1400 megaWatts (mW) of power generation in service and get revenues of $143-151 million from new projects, about INR 1,023 to 1,032 billion rupees—assuming the currency doesn't fall further. It is close to break-even and may cross over into profit later next year.
Its cost per mW of new solar power in the first half fell to INR 44.3 million ($610,000) and the project cost per mW was INR 50.78 million ($700,000) thanks to cheaper modules and better skills in placing them.
From the start, the younger Mr Wadhwa knew how to open international and New Delhi financial taps for solar plants: the International Finance Corp. (the market arm of the World Bank); German, Canadian, Quebec, and French development banks; Foundation Capital of Menlo Park; India's Helion Ventures Fund; Indian Railways; and government bodies in 23 states including Rajasthan, Punjab, and Gujarat.

598,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- First US Bancshares FUSB,"First US Bancshares (FUSB), our favorite conservative idea for 2019, is expanding with the takeover of The Peoples Bank, moving it beyond Alabama into Tennessee and Virginia, suggests Benj Gallander, editor of Contra the Heard.
CEO/President James F. House stated, “We have now added a talented banking team and an excellent customer base in the Knoxville, Tennessee and southwest Virginia areas.""
He added, ""We believe that this expansion will provide significant opportunity for future growth, particularly with respect to commercial lending in the vibrant Knoxville market. As we complete the integration of our organizations and move beyond the nonrecurring acquisition expenses, the acquisition should quickly begin to bring improved efficiency and earnings growth.”
House has been the CEO since 2011. He has been in the industry for over 35 years and one can garner that he has seen it all. For investors, that adds a level of confidence, as too often, bankers tend to lose their way.
In 2014, the bank recommenced a dividend of a penny a quarter, after a three-year hiatus. Now it is up to two cents. Prior to the financial crisis, it was $0.27 a quarter. Given that the share count has remained flat, further increases are likely in the cards.
The stock seems cheap. Book value is $12.31, about one-third more than the trading price. The capitalization ratios are excellent with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios each 12.28 percent. Its total capital ratio is 13.20 percent, and its Tier 1 leverage ratio is 8.78 percent. Insiders own about 5.6 percent.
Interest rates likely have some upside push left. That should help the banking sector and benefit the bank. First U.S. Bancshares used to trade at much higher levels.

599,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Ciena CIEN,"Ciena Corporation (CIEN) is a well-managed networker, and compared to its peers, and actually well diversified, too, with its hands in many fast-growing cookie jars, explains Mike Cintolo, editor of Cabot Growth Investor.
While the details of its products can give you an ice cream headache, the big idea is simpler — after many years of investments, Ciena is a leading provider of solutions to a variety of lucrative end markets, including webscale data center, 5G, fiber deep (putting fiber closer to users to deliver a better experience, which is key for over-the-top services and cord cutters), mobile and Internet of Things, with consistently growing market share.
And with growth in these markets picking up and Ciena executing flawlessly, the firm’s best days are ahead of it—sales and earnings growth have begun to accelerate, and the quarterly report from early December easily topped expectations.
Just as important to us given networking stocks’ on-again, off-again history, Ciena has a solid long-term outlook — the company upped its three-year growth outlook to 7%-ish revenue growth and 20% earnings growth.
This is up from 15% previously — though Wall Street is guessing the company is being conservative per usual; analysts see the firm’s earnings up 35% this fiscal year (which just started in November) and another 25% next year.
Ciena appears to be a top play in a new leading theme (5G and webscale infrastructure) during the next market upturn. As for the stock, it actually broke out of a three-year launching pad in September and has held up (and even poked to higher highs) during the market's implosion—a great sign the weak hands are already out.

600,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- B2GOLD BTG,"Gold bottomed in December 2015 and momentum has been shifting to the upside since then, with gold’s overall direction being up. But a multi-year resistance at $1365 has been very strong suggesting the mega trend in gold has not yet shifted to bullish, suggests Omar Ayales, commodity expert and editor of Gold Charts R Us.
Interestingly, 2018 was a very telling year given the fueling of deflationary concerns over trade skirmishes between the U.S. and China. Remember, deflationary fear is what pushed gold into a bear market back in 2013.
However, gold held above $1200 as buyers flocked in whenever this level was tested thereby showing strong support. Today, deflationary concerns over trade wars are subsiding and the worst seems to have been priced into gold, resources and other assets leaving the upside as the most viable direction for the gold universe.
Not only that, a plethora of political and geopolitical uncertainties is also supportive of higher gold. Gold is poised to test its key resistance level at $1365 as 2019 gets underway. A break above this level could shift gold’s mega trend to the upside with handsome upside potential.
But although gold itself is a great investment for 2019, I prefer to invest in the gold mines. They tend to move up with gold. Moreover, they’re grossly undervalued compared to gold and thereby offer the best upside potential.
One of the companies we like the most is B2GOLD (BTG). It’s a mid-tier company that’s quickly becoming one of the largest producers. It has great management, great assets and it’s one of the gold mines with a healthy balance sheet, sitting on a bunch of cash.
Technically, the stock is just breaking above a sideways consolidation band showing upside potential. We bought near $2.60 during the consolidation (and riskier) phase. However, buying below $2.85 is a great opportunity. Our upside target for the first quarter of 2019 is $3.25, an approximate 20% increase.

601,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Citigroup C," Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is a leading global financial institution with approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions, notes Jason Clark, a value investing specialist and contributing editor to The Prudent Speculator.
Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management.
While Citi had a strong 2017, shares were off more than 30% in 2018, despite rising interest rates and increasing profits.
Even though the company faces some operational headwinds in different segments of its business, we continue to see a more focused and recapitalized Citigroup as prepared to reward investors over the long-term.
Additionally, we like that Citi has good leverage towards a still solid U.S. economy, while also having the potential to show outsized benefits versus its peers from growth in Asia, Latin America and other emerging economies. Further, it seems the bank is still on its way to achieving its low-50s efficiency-ratio target by 2020.
Citigroup shares trade at 70% of book value per share and less than 7 times NTM adjusted EPS forecasts, all while offering a dividend yield of 3.6%, while the bank continues to consistently buy back its stock.

602,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Abbott Laboratories ABT,"If the 2018 market proved anything it is that you need to own stocks with an earnings backbone. That’s because like the cream, great companies with strong earnings and strong products pipelines tend to quickly rise to the top. One such company is medical device maker  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), suggests Jim Woods, editor of Fast Money Alert.
The diversified medical device maker, whose products include blood glucose monitoring kits, nutritional healthcare products, diagnostic products and equipment, has seen strong EPS growth that’s put it in the top quartile of all publicly traded companies (growth over the past two quarters and past several years).
That growth has been recognized by the fast money in 2018, as ABT’s 2018 gain of nearly 27% puts it in the top 6% of price performers over the past year (it also pays a 1.8% dividend yield for even more upside). 
One personal note here, I am about to get some firsthand knowledge of one very interesting new Abbot product called DRG therapy. This surgically implanted electronic stimulation device is used for chronic pain management (in my case injuries from years of martial arts, bodybuilding and military training).
The device delivers pain relief to a reported 74.2% of patients who suffer from complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. Hopefully, I will be in that near three-quarters of patients with those positive results.
For Wall Street, the upside in Abbott has allowed it to trade well above its 200-day moving average in 2018. And despite the volatility we witnessed in most stocks during Q4, the shares ended the year back above its short-term, 50-day moving average at a time when most stocks were tanking.
I suspect the stock is just getting started, and in 2019, I think this healthcare standout is a good way to ease the 2018 portfolio pain. Disclosure: At the time of this writing, Jim Woods was long ABT in his Fast Money Alert advisory service.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 06:56AM ET</span>",Hitachi freezes UK nuclear project as Brexit crisis deepens,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Nina Chestney
TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) decided on Thursday to freeze a 3 trillion yen ($28 billion) nuclear power project in Wales as Britain scrabbles for a way to exit the European Union, dealing a blow to UK plans for the replacement of aging plants.
The suspension comes as Hitachi's Horizon Nuclear Power failed to find private investors for its plans to build a plant in Anglesey, which was expected to provide about 6 percent of Britain's electricity.
""We've made the decision to freeze the project from the economic standpoint as a private company,"" Hitachi said in a statement, adding that it had booked a write-down of 300 billion yen.
Hitachi had called on the British government to boost financial support for the project to appease investor anxiety, but turmoil over the country's impending EU exit limited the government's capacity to compile plans, people close to the matter have previously said. 
Hitachi had banked on a group of Japanese investors and the British government each taking a one-third stake in the equity portion of the project, the people said. The project would have been financed one-third by equity and rest by debt.
""It is now clear that further time is needed to develop a financial structure for the Horizon project and the conditions for building and operating the nuclear power stations,"" Hitachi said.
With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is now in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
Prime Minister Theresa May's two-year attempt to forge an amicable divorce was crushed by parliament this week in the biggest defeat for a British leader in modern history, deepening uncertainty for potential investors.
The withdrawal of the Japanese conglomerate could leave the nuclear newbuild industry open to Russian and Chinese state-owned companies as Western private firms struggle to compete.
China's General Nuclear Services, an industrial partnership between China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) and French utility EDF (PA:EDF), plans to make a number of investments in Britain’s nuclear power sector, most notably the Hinkley Point C project in southwest England.
CGN also intends to deploy the first Chinese-designed reactor for use in Britain at a plant in Bradwell, Essex.
MAXIMIZING VALUE 
The UK government said that despite negotiations with Hitachi, they failed to reach an agreement. The focus for the government was about driving  down costs and maximizing value for consumers and the taxpayer.
The UK government remains committed to the nuclear sector and is reviewing alternative funding models for future projects and will give an update this summer, it added.
Britain wants new nuclear plants to help replace its aging fleet of nuclear and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s, but high up-front costs have deterred construction.
Another Japanese firm, Toshiba Corp (T:6502), scrapped its British NuGen project last year after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer.
Hitachi stopped short of scrapping the Anglesey project in northern Wales. The company will continue discussions with the British government on nuclear power, it said.
The nuclear write-down wipes off the Horizon unit's asset value, which stood at 296 billion yen at the end of September.
Horizon Nuclear Power said it would take steps to reduce its presence but was keeping the option open to resume development in the future.
""Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey remains the best site for nuclear development in the UK and we remain committed to keeping channels of communication open with the government and our other key stakeholders regarding future options at both our sites,"" said Duncan Hawthorne, chief executive of Horizon.
However, analysts and investors viewed the suspension as an effective withdrawal and saw the decision as a positive step that has removed uncertainties for the Japanese conglomerate.
Hitachi bought Horizon in 2012 for 696 million pounds ($1.12 billion), from E.ON and RWE as the German utilities decided to sell their joint venture following Germany's nuclear exit after the Fukushima accident.
Hitachi's latest decision also further dims Japan's export prospects.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) has effectively abandoned its Sinop nuclear project in Turkey, a person involved in the project previously told Reuters, as cost estimates had nearly doubled to around 5 trillion yen.

The French bank said it expects revenue in its global markets and investor services business to have fallen by around 20% in the fourth quarter. While Wall Street also had a generally tough time in markets at the end of last year, U.S. banks have the benefit of higher interest rates and a stronger domestic economy.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Renault executives, French government officials to meet Nissan CEO: Nikkei","TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  executives and French government officials were planning to meet Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa in Japan on Thursday, Japanese media said, as the automakers consider their partnership in the wake of alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest.
Ghosn, arrested and detained in Tokyo since Nov. 19, has been indicted in Japan on charges of under-reporting his salary for eight years through March 2018, and temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan Motor (T:7201) during the global financial crisis.
Nissan ousted him as chairman following his arrest, with Mitsubishi Motor (T:7211) - the third member of the automaking alliance - soon following suit. 
Ghosn, however, continues to chair Renault (PA:RENA), where he is also CEO, as well as the alliance.
The visiting French delegation is seeking an explanation from Nissan's management regarding its corporate governance in the wake of Ghosn's arrest, the Nikkei business daily reported, without citing sources. 
Emmanuel Moulin, chief of staff to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, and Martin Vial, who heads the ministry's state holding agency and is also a Renault director, were likely to discuss potential candidates for Ghosn's successor at Renault, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.
The French government declined to comment on the itinerary for the delegation. Nissan could not be immediately reached.
Renault, under increasing government pressure to name a new CEO and chairman, is planning to hold a board meeting later this week to begin the process of appointing one or more successors to Ghosn, three people briefed on the process have told Reuters. 
Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), is likely to replace Ghosn as Renault chairman, according to two sources.

The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the Renault CEO role currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore.

611,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",Prisoner in Vancouver: Huawei CFO Awaits Her Fate in Splendor,"(Bloomberg) -- Meng Wanzhou steps out of her $4.2 million mansion, a GPS monitor strapped to her ankle, and slips into a chauffeured black SUV. Then she’s off, largely free to roam the shops and restaurants within 100 square miles of Vancouver until her 11 p.m. curfew.
So goes another day of house arrest for Meng, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co. and daughter of the billionaire founder of China’s biggest telecom provider. It is, by all appearances, a comfortable life for someone at the center of a complex power game.
Meng’s arrest at the behest of the U.S. -- which wants to extradite her on grounds she tricked banks into potentially violating Iran sanctions -- has sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row. Nine days after her Dec. 1 arrest during a stop over in Vancouver, China detained two Canadians on national security grounds. And this week, a China court imposed a death sentence, following a one-day trial, on a Canadian found guilty of drug smuggling.
How Meng’s case will be resolved remains unclear, though she’s become an object of fascination in a city where her family owns two homes and where she spent down time when she wasn’t running Huawei’s finances. Tourists stop by to take selfies outside her home near a 2,000-acre park overlooking the Pacific Ocean, where she is ensconced with her husband and daughter.
Home Reno
Meng’s bail terms include the GPS monitor, an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, and 24-hour surveillance by a private security firm, Lions Gate Risk Management Group. Their job is to ensure she doesn’t violate the conditions of her release. She pays the hefty bill for that monitoring, which includes two guards at a time and a driver.
""If I were on The Price is Right, I’d say that’s about $7,000 a day,"" or more than $2.5 million a year, said Nicholas Casale, a former police detective, referencing the game show. Casale structured Bernie Madoff’s bail agreement and acted as monitor for the disgraced money manager for about three months.
Meng’s long leash following her C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail is unusual, he said -- normally, the defendant’s movements and communications would be restricted.
""You can’t just go to dinner or go shopping,"" Casale said.
Nissan Arrest
The conditions of Meng’s house arrest are in stark contrast to another corporate titan -- former Nissan Motor Co. chairman Carlos Ghosn -- who is confined at a Tokyo detention center. He arrived in handcuffs, plastic slippers and a rope around his waist in court last week. Meng is also faring better than the two Canadians detained in China, who have had scant consular access.
That hasn’t stopped China’s envoy to Canada from protesting Meng’s treatment. In a fiery op-ed published in an Ottawa newspaper last week, Ambassador Lu Shaye railed against ""Western egotism"" and ""white supremacy"" of those who have criticized China for detaining the Canadians, in what was widely seen as retaliation.
""Have they shown any concern or sympathy for Meng after she was illegally detained and deprived of freedom?,"" Lu wrote in the Hill Times.
Meng, 46, sported a purple Hermes scarf and Bottega Veneta handbag when she first reported to her bail supervisor in Vancouver on Dec. 12. Renovations, meanwhile, are underway at her other C$16.3 million mansion in one of Vancouver’s toniest neighborhoods, where a truck from a high-end closet designer was parked outside recently. Her defense indicated she’d like to move there when it’s ready. If she does, she’ll be two doors down from the U.S. consul general’s residence, where the star-spangled banner flaps on the front lawn.
Slow Process
Getting glimpses of her daily life is difficult -- her guards appear to have taken on the responsibility of shielding her from the public eye. When Bloomberg News journalists parked on the street next to her home last week and identified themselves as press, one guard took photos of the license plate as another sped over in his white SUV to block their vehicle. As Meng slipped out of her house in her Lululemon jacket, the guard began accusing the journalists of damaging his car before later acknowledging he’d obstructed them.
Still, the outings and post-card views mask a darker reality for Meng: This extradition process could drag on for months and possibly years, if history is any guide. And the odds are high that she will be extradited in the end.
“The tilt of the Crown in these cases is extradite, extradite, extradite,"" said Robert Currie, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia who specializes in international law. Canada’s extradition law ""is unbalanced to the point where a number of critics, including me, have said it’s unfair.""
Canada Crime
The U.S. must turn over its formal extradition request by the end of January. Canada’s Justice Minister David Lametti can reject the request or order extradition hearings to begin. It’s not clear if that will happen before Meng’s next court date.
Lametti can’t arbitrarily refuse. His ministry would have to determine that fraud doesn’t constitute a crime in Canada -- an implausible finding. Furthermore, in Canada, the extradition judge has to accept whatever evidence the U.S. presents at face value -- the proceedings don’t consider the strength of the evidence or the likelihood of conviction.
Canadian judges end up approving about 90 percent of extradition requests because the system makes it nearly impossible to mount a defense, says Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who’s been involved in hundreds of extradition cases.
Jump High
""They say ’Jump,’ and Canada says ’How high?,’"" he said.
For her part, Meng has hinted at how she’d like to spend her time during what could be a years-long ordeal.
She’d like to apply for a PhD in business administration at the University of British Columbia, whose campus sits near her home. In an awkward twist, the school is receiving C$3 million from Huawei to fund research on 5G -- the next-generation mobile network technology that the U.S. wants to block the company from developing.
""I’ve been working hard for 25 years,"" she said through her lawyer during her bail hearings last month. ""If released, my only simple goal would be to spend time with my husband and daughter. I haven’t read a novel in years.""

MUNICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) will not make further concessions to save a rail merger deal with France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) even after European competition authorities demanded further concessions, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Siemens is ready to walk away from the tie-up which was announced in Sept. 2017, a source familiar with the matter said.
""If the Commission refuses, then we cannot do the deal,"" this source said, ""Then this topic is over.""
Siemens has already offered to license parts of its high speed train business and sell parts of its signaling operations to meet the concerns of the EU authorities who are worried about stifling competition in the rail sector.
But a key disagreement remains around how much of its high-speed train technology - which allows trains to travel faster than 250 km per hour - Siemens should be made to share with third parties. 
The first source said the fate of the merger now rests with the European Commission, which is due to make a ruling by February 18. Siemens still considers the merger with Alstom to be the best option, the first source explained. 
The deal would create the world's second largest rail company with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros, roughly half the size of China's state-owned CRRC Corp Ltd (601766.SS.) but twice the size of Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb).
If the merger is not approved, the German company remains confident about the growth prospects for its own in-house rail technology division - called Siemens Mobility, sources said.
Growth opportunities included potential acquisitions, the first source said, although a collaboration with Bombardier is not on the agenda. 
""We will consider all options,"" the first source said, including a potential float of the Siemens mobility business with Siemens keeping a stake.
""We absolutely believe that we can develop our business as it is today in a very attractive way,"" said the first source. 
Alstom on Thursday said it was making progress on the deal and was optimistic it could be completed in the first half of 2019.
""The proposed combination of Alstom with Siemens Mobility, including its rail traction drive business, has progressed in the last quarter,"" Alstom said in statement, adding that both companies had presented proposals to win over regulators.
""The proposed remedies include mainly signaling activities as well as rolling stock products and represent around four percent of the sales of the combined entity. The parties consider that the proposed remedy package is appropriate and adequate,"" added Alstom.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome if the European Commission asked for more concessions.
In 2017, Siemens and Alstom agreed to merge their rail operations, creating a European group better able to withstand the international advance of CCRC. 
The German government has given its backing to the merger, saying it would help secure the competitiveness of the European rail industry. France has also said a decision to block the merger would be a mistake.
However Germany's antitrust authority and four other national regulators have expressed concerns to the European Union's competition watchdog. 
In December, European antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager voiced her doubts over the impact that their deal would have on high-speed trains in Europe.

MILAN (Reuters) - A profit warning from  Societe Generale  and new frictions over Chinese tech giant Huawei weighed on European shares on Thursday, as investors turned their focus to the start of the earnings season. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.2 percent by 0936 GMT, having fallen as much as 0.6 percent in early trade, while Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) index (GDAXI) fell 0.5 percent and Britain's FTSE (FTSE) slid 0.4 percent. 
Investors worried that action against Huawei could further complicate trade talks between Washington and Beijing at a time when signs of a global economic slowdown are growing.
Some U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips to Huawei and other Chinese firms that violate U.S. sanctions, while a Wall Street Journal report said U.S. prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets.
""China are unlikely to shrug this off which is creating a risk-off environment. Signs of retaliation from China could see stocks sink further,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. 
Carmakers (SXAP), which are highly sensitive to trade and have large exposure to both the Chinese and U.S. economies, were the biggest losers, down 0.7 percent. 
U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought U.S. President Donald Trump was inclined to impose tariffs on European cars to win better terms on agriculture.
European technology stocks (SX8P) fell 0.3 percent as chipmakers dropped after Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) forecast its steepest revenue fall in a decade.
Societe Generale (PA:SOGN) shares were the biggest losers in the banking sector, down 3.3 percent. The French bank said its fourth-quarter results would be affected by tough market conditions and the impact of some asset sales.
The warning, which hit stocks of French rivals  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) surprised investors and highlighted how European banks have been lagging their Wall Street peers.
""I have a preference for the U.S. banks. SocGen shows how tough things are for European banks,"" said Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Prime Partners.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), however, rose 0.3 percent. A top government official said on Wednesday that mergers among Italian lenders could make the banking system more solid, as the sector seeks to further cut its bad loan pile. 

Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine (VI:VOES) was another heavy faller, sliding 6.4 percent after another profit warning, while UK software firm Sage (L:SGE) shot to the top of the STOXX, after quarterly organic revenues rose 7.6 percent.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>","U.S. legislation steps up pressure on Huawei and ZTE, China calls it 'hysteria'","By Diane Bartz and Christian Shepherd
WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], ZTE Corp (HK:0763) or other Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.
The proposed law drew sharp criticism from China where Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called the U.S. legislation ""hysteria"", intensifying a bitter trade war between Beijing and Washington. 
The bills were introduced shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from T-Mobile U.S. Inc and other U.S. businesses.
The Journal said that an indictment could be coming soon on allegations that Huawei stole T-Mobile technology, called Tappy, which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones.
Huawei said in a statement the company and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a U.S. jury verdict that found ""neither damage, unjust enrichment nor wilful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile's trade secret claim"".
Hua urged U.S. lawmakers to block the bills. 
""I believe the action of these few representatives are an expression of extreme arrogance and an extreme lack of self-confidence,"" Hua said.
""Actually the whole world can see very clearly that the real intent of the United States is to employ its state apparatus in every conceivable way to suppress and block out China's high-tech companies,"" she added.
The legislation is the latest in a long list of actions taken to fight what some in the Trump administration call China's cheating through intellectual property theft, illegal corporate subsidies and rules hampering U.S. corporations that want to sell their goods in China.
PRESSURE MOUNTING
In November, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an initiative to investigate China's trade practices with a goal of bringing trade secret theft cases.
At that time, Washington had announced an indictment against Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd for stealing trade secrets from U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) relating to research and development of memory storage devices.
Jinhua, which has denied any wrongdoing, was put on a list of entities that cannot buy goods from U.S. firms. 
On Capitol Hill, Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Mike Gallagher, both Republicans, along with Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Ruben Gallego, both Democrats, introduced the bills that would require the president to ban the export of U.S. components to any Chinese telecommunications company that violates U.S. sanctions or export control laws.
The bills specifically cite ZTE and Huawei, both of which are viewed with suspicion in the United States because of fears that their switches and other gear could be used to spy on Americans. Both have also been accused of failing to respect U.S. sanctions on Iran. 
""Huawei is effectively an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party whose founder and CEO was an engineer for the People's Liberation Army,"" Cotton wrote in a statement. ""If Chinese telecom companies like Huawei violate our sanctions or export control laws, they should receive nothing less than the death penalty - which this denial order would provide.""
The proposed law and investigation are two of several challenges that Huawei, the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker, faces in the U.S. market.
In addition to allegations of sanctions-busting and intellectual property theft, Washington has been pressing allies to refrain from buying Huawei's switches and other gear because of fears they will be used by Beijing for espionage. 
Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, denied this week that his company was used by the Chinese government to spy.
Canada detained Ren's daughter, Meng Wanzhou, who is Huawei's chief financial officer, in December at the request of U.S. authorities investigating an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.
For its part, ZTE agreed last year to pay a $1 billion fine to the United States that had been imposed because the company breached a U.S. embargo on trade with Iran. 

As part of the agreement, the U.S. lifted a ban in place since April that had prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it relies on heavily to make smartphones and other devices.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:37AM ET</span>",Trump tariffs force tough choices at U.S. auto suppliers,"By Nick Carey
WYOMING, Mich. (Reuters) - Bob Roth makes no bones about his feelings towards U.S. manufacturing. 
The co-owner and chief executive of RoMan Manufacturing Inc, which makes transformers and glass-molding equipment for automakers and other industries, asks callers on his voicemail: ""What have you done today to support U.S. manufacturing?"" 
His procurement team has been under long-standing orders to source all parts and materials as near as possible to his western Michigan factory, even with President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum. 
But with those tariffs dragging into a new year and steel comprising a quarter of RoMan's fixed costs, Roth says his company has now begun the lengthy process of switching from its U.S. suppliers to an Israeli company for a key component for its products.
It is a strategic decision that RoMan and other auto suppliers have put off since the tariffs kicked in last spring. With tariffs firmly part of the landscape, some are now starting to shift their own supply chain to keep costs in check, according to more than a dozen interviews with U.S. auto suppliers and industry consultants. (U.S. jobs impact of metal tariffs: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RKvA83)
The choice is stark for most suppliers: absorb the extra cost, pass them on to customers or find ways to slash material costs.
The transformers Roth's 150 workers at RoMan produce require a magnetized steel core that is now more expensive as tariffs have allowed U.S. steel producers to raise prices. The Israeli supplier has access to cheaper steel and its cores qualify as finished products, so they are not subject to tariffs - making them a cheaper alternative.
""We don't have the money to buy our way out problems like this,"" Roth said of RoMan, which has annual revenue of around $35 million. ""In the long run we can't afford to absorb the extra cost of tariffs.""
Roth says he appreciates the sentiment behind Trump's push to bring back American manufacturers jobs, but adds tariffs are ""the wrong tool"" because they hurt U.S. firms.
Trade consulting firm Trade Partnership Worldwide LLC estimated last summer metals tariffs could cost 5,000 jobs in the U.S. auto industry and 400,000 jobs overall - 16 jobs lost for every steel or aluminum worker hired. But so far there is little data available on how tariffs affect businesses such as RoMan because the process of switching suppliers is a long one and many manufacturers have muddled through so far.
For agraphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2RKvA83 
Steven Wybo, a managing director at consultancy Conway MacKenzie, said ""every single auto supplier we are working with has concerns around tariffs,"" and he worries they come at an already challenging time for the sector. 
Suppliers are gearing up for a large number of vehicle launches over the next three years, an expensive business, while also bracing for an expected decline in U.S. new vehicle sales. And some in the sector will bear the brunt of restructuring at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) General Motors Co (N:GM), which are dropping less-popular sedan models. 
Adding tariffs to the mix can require a creative approach.   
RoMan, for instance, splits half of a 10 percent tariff with a Chinese customer on transformers subject to retaliatory measures against U.S. manufacturers. RoMan will raise some prices 2 percent this month to partially offset rising copper prices.
Warren, Michigan-based Eckhart Inc - which books about $100 million in annual sales by building robots and automated tools for GM, Volvo and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and other automakers - must absorb the tariffs or run the risk of losing out in competitive bids.
So Eckhart has focused on cutting costs, including rolling out a new U.S. purchasing system for raw materials, CEO Andrew Storm said.
""We have to fight for every single dollar of revenue that comes in the door,"" Storm said. ""So we find ways to eat the extra cost.""
That is why RoMan is seeking alternative suppliers to cut costs - and it takes a long time to ensure a new supplier is financially sound and can consistently hit industry standards. Months into that process, RoMan is only now validating test parts produced by its potential new Israeli supplier. 
""You can't turn your supply chain on a dime,"" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR). 
Dziczek said she gets calls ""all the time"" from suppliers wondering whether to overhaul their supply chain, and yet worrying that if they do, Trump may reverse policy overnight.
LOSING BUSINESS
The issue stretches up and down the supply chain for cars. Ford and GM have already warned metals tariffs will cost them $1 billion each in profits, setting in motion a complex dance over who foots the bill.
If automakers have to cover the cost, they typically raise vehicle prices to pass it onto consumers. Just this week, a Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) executive said industry wide tariffs have increased the average U.S. vehicle price by around $600.
Peter Bible, chief risk officer at tax advisory firm EisnerAmper and former chief accounting officer at GM, said suppliers making parts for less-popular vehicles will have trouble passing on higher costs. Automakers will resist price increases, but will be also be wary of pushing suppliers too hard, Bible said.
Problems at a single supplier can be disastrous, as Ford discovered last May when a fire at a supplier halted production of some highly-profitable pickup trucks.
Some suppliers have adapted quickly to cut costs. 
They have cost  Gentherm  Inc (O:THRM), which makes climate control systems for vehicles and had revenue of close to $1 billion in 2017, a ""few million"" dollars, according to CEO Phil Eyler. 
""We've worked really fast to change supplier locations in a couple cases,"" he said. 
Mark Wakefield, a managing director at consultancy AlixPartners, said suppliers providing more commoditized parts will find adjusting harder.
That's the case for Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Pridgeon & Clay, which supplies stamped steel and stainless steel parts to automakers, with annual revenue of more than $350 million. 
Third-generation owner Kevin Clay has lost business to low-cost overseas competitors in India who use cheaper tariff-free steel, and whose finished products are not subject to Trump's U.S. tariffs.
Metal tariffs have shaved 25 percent off Clay's pre-tax profit. Banks still wary of his sector following the Great Recession are growing reluctant to issue loans, and his company has mothballed some spending plans and cut staff more than usual for this time of year, according to Clay.

""These tariffs have cost me business,"" said Clay, who describes himself as a moderate conservative who fervently believes in free trade. ""If the aim is to get to a tariff-free world, this is a crappy way to get there.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (T:2914) on Thursday unveiled two ""heat-not-burn"" products, as it races against market leader Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) for a larger share of the vaping space with conventional cigarettes steadily falling out of favor.
Despite commanding 60 percent of the local cigarette market, Japan Tobacco has been caught on the wrong side of the rising popularity of heat-not-burn (HNB) alternatives and has lagged in the category in its own backyard versus the Marlboro maker.
Philip Morris in 2014 started selling its IQOS HNB device in Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country's pharmaceutical regulation. 
Japan Tobacco managed to roll out its vaping product, Ploom TECH, only by 2017 after repeated production delays. And even then, some users have complained about its weak taste.
It is now planning to start selling Ploom TECH+ and Ploom S in Japan from Jan. 29 to tap into the HNB market that continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. 
Ploom TECH+ is priced at 4,980 yen, while Ploom S will sell for 7,980 yen - same as IQOS' cheapest version. 
""We are aiming for the No. 1 position,"" said Mutsuo Iwai, head of Japan Tobacco's domestic tobacco business. 
""Japan is the biggest HNB market, a success in Japan will lead to a success globally.""
PROMISING BETTER TASTE
IQOS had a 71.8 percent share of Japan's HNB market last year, while British American Tobacco's (L:BATS) glo had 20.1 percent and Ploom TECH's 8.1 percent, Nomura estimates. 
HNB products accounted for 20.9 percent of Japan's tobacco market in 2018, versus 12 percent a year ago, according to an estimate by Satoshi Fujiwara, an analyst at Nomura.
Japan Tobacco has said it expects vaping products to account for 30 percent of the domestic tobacco market by end-2020 and will spend heavily in the field as cigarette sales drop. 
Japan Tobacco's conventional cigarette sales volume in the country fell 11.4 percent over Jan-Nov last year.
The former state monopoly, still one-third owned by the government, has been scrambling to launch new HNB products after many smokers found the taste of its current one weak.
Unlike IQOS and glo, Ploom TECH does not directly heat tobacco rolls. Instead, it generates vapor that goes through a tobacco-packed capsule, emitting far less smell but, according to users, less potent than rival products.
This has partly hurt sales, with the firm in October cutting its Ploom TECH capsules sales forecast by 30 percent for 2018. 
Iwai said the new products were Japan Tobacco's answer to user complaints as they are designed to give a stronger taste.

""We believe we can lure back those who tried Ploom TECH but stopped using it,"" he said.

627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",The U.S. Case Against Huawei Is Getting Real,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- An investigation by federal authorities into the possible theft of trade secrets by Huawei Technologies Co. could give even more weight to a U.S. campaign against the Chinese company.
Civil suits against Huawei, including a case where it was found liable by a jury in 2017 for the theft of T-Mobile US Inc. robotics technology, appear to be the springboard for potential federal indictments, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
Such a move makes the fight against China’s biggest smartphone and telecommunications equipment maker more tangible, and gets to the heart of U.S. economic interests. Intellectual-property theft has been a core argument underpinning President Donald Trump’s trade war. 
There are three basic complaints the U.S. has against Huawei, and China by extension:
While the U.S. takes its sanctions against foreign powers very seriously – highlighted by the December detention in Canada of CFO Meng Wanzhou – much of the world rolls its eyes but plays along anyway. 
Meng herself is accused of a different but related offense: committing fraud by lying about Huawei’s connection to those firms that allegedly sold equipment to Iran. The breach of a trade embargo could very well weaken Washington’s tough stance against countries it wishes to punish. Still it’s debatable whether sanctions actually further U.S. security or economic interests.
Claims of espionage cut to the issue of national security and sovereignty. But solid evidence against Huawei has been lacking. While last week’s arrest in Poland of a Huawei employee strengthens the U.S. case, it’s not a slam dunk. The company’s founder Ren Zhengfei broke years of silence this week to sit down with foreign media and deny accusations of spying.
That leaves trade-secrets theft as the battlefront where the U.S. can truly bare its knuckles. 
U.S. criminal investigators and courts tend to take breaches of intellectual property seriously because it threatens the nation’s pride and joy: technology. Even President Donald Trump has cited alleged technological theft for his beef with China.
It’s also the most contentious of the aforementioned complaints. Assuming the U.S. has documents showing Huawei’s links to sanction-busting companies, and proof that Meng and the firm didn’t tell the whole truth, the case should be pretty straight forward. Spy cases, once discovered, also have the potential to be easily proven with a few text messages or emails.
IP cases are anything but simple. Plaintiffs have to provide evidence they even have rights over the technology in question. Then they have to prove it was stolen. The defense can respond by claiming it developed these capabilities on its own, got the technology elsewhere, or doesn’t even have it anyway. The burden of proof in a criminal case is higher than that for civil, with the potential to bamboozle juries.
The spoils from winning such a battle can be great. A judge’s ruling to block import of certain products, or impose fines, is unlikely to be overturned by the executive branch – even by a wheeler-dealer president. This means a victory can be concrete and lasting. 
With intellectual property so fundamental to the U.S. and its global dominance, fighting that battle starts to make the war against Huawei very real.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 11:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: British Lotus cars to be 'Made in China' at new Geely plant: documents,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese owner of Lotus plans to start producing the British sports car brand in China for the first time with the opening of a new 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) factory in Wuhan city, company job advertisements and government documents showed. 
The previously unreported plans are Zhejiang Geely Holding Group's [GEELY.UL] first move to shake up the British brand since its purchase of a majority stake in 2017. 
The move is in line with Geely's ambitions to build more up-market cars and throw off its reputation for copycat designs and shoddy quality. For Lotus, it could mean greater production volumes and new models such as SUVs to boost sales.
""For Geely, going high-end can help it take more market share,"" said Alan Kang, Shanghai based analyst at LMC Automotive. ""Geely needs to do that to better compete with global brands.""
Lotus cars are currently built in Norfolk, England. 
Geely and Lotus said in a joint statement that while Norfolk was Lotus's manufacturing home, a key part of the firm's strategy to revive the brand was expanding the brand's manufacturing footprint globally. 
""Details on additional locations and models will be confirmed in due course,"" the company said in an e-mail to Reuters.
The planning authority of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, last month approved Geely's plans for the plant. The factory will be able to manufacture 150,000 cars annually, according to a document posted on the authority's website. 
The Wuhan Development Zone, where the factory will be based, said in a statement posted on its website last month that production at the plant would include ""Geely's Lotus project"". 
The Wuhan Development Zone did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The documents did not say when the plant would start operations. The facility is approved to build all-electric battery cars, electric hybrids as well as combustion engine cars like Lotuses.
Job advertisements on Geely's website show the automaker is looking to fill at least 20 Wuhan-based roles for the Lotus project. 
LUXURY AMBITIONS 
While is not clear what portion of the new Chinese production line would be devoted to the British brand, greater production volumes would be consistent with Geely's stated ambition to grow the market for Lotus by broadening its line-up.
Geely sold only 1,630 Lotuses globally in 2018. 
Lotus currently produces models such as the Evora and Elise. James Bond famously drove a Lotus Esprit in 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", and Lotus once boasted a Formula One team until it was sold to  Renault  (PA:RENA) for just one pound in 2015. 
But in a major break with the past, two sources familiar with the matter said Lotus would likely make luxury SUVs instead of sports cars during the Wuhan plant's initial phase. 
One of the sources said Geely wanted to emulate premium carmakers like  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), whose luxury SUV models were selling well in China. 
The share of luxury SUVs in China's overall passenger car market grew from 4.07 percent in 2014 to 5.01 percent in 2018, according to data from consultancy J.D. Power.
Geely has forecast flat sales this year after the Chinese auto market contracted for the first time in more than two decades in 2018. 
The company has made waves in the auto world with its $9 billion purchase of a stake in Germany's Daimler AG (DE:DAIG) and its $1.8 billion acquisition of Sweden's Volvo. It bought 51 percent of Lotus from Malaysian automaker Proton in 2017.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were up 0.5% and 0.1% respectively by 11:04 PM ET (04:04 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%.
On Wednesday, the People’s Bank of China injected CNY 560 billion into the country’s banking system.
The central bank said in a statement on its website that the total liquidity of the banking system is “declining rather quickly” as it was the “peak of the tax period.”
Separately, Chinese officials also announced tax cuts to support small businesses and public spending.
The moves came after China reported weaker-than-expected export and PMI data earlier this month.
Meanwhile, Huawei Technologies was in focus on Thursday after a group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills to ban the sale of U.S. chips to the company.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day that federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. business partners.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.1%, while South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.3%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 also rose 0.3%.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed higher, with banks outperformed as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) delivered stronger-than-expected earnings results for the fourth quarter.
In the U.K., Prime Minister Theresa May won a confidence vote overnight as expected.
On Tuesday, the House of Commons voted 432 versus 202 against her Brexit deal. While the defeat itself was widely expected by investors, the margin of the loss came as a surprise.

The credit rating agency downgraded the unit's rating to 'D' from 'CC' after Pacific Gas and Electric failed to make the $21.6 million interest payment due on Tuesday, as the company planned to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The latest cut comes two days after both Fitch and S&P downgraded PG&E and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit in the face of massive claims stemming from deadly wildfires.
PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion because of the fires.
The most recent fire last November killed at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive blaze in California history.
San Francisco-based PG&E is working on lining up roughly $5.5 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing to help operations during bankruptcy proceedings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert prevailed in a bankruptcy auction for the U.S. department store chain with an improved takeover bid of roughly $5.2 billion, allowing the 126-year-old retailer to keep its doors open, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
Lampert's bid, boosted from an earlier $5 billion offer, prevailed after weeks of back-and-forth deliberations that culminated in a days-long bankruptcy auction held behind closed doors. The billionaire's proposal, made through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, will save up to 45,000 jobs and keep 425 stores open across the United States. 
Lampert boosted his bid by adding more cash and assuming more liabilities, the sources said. The auction, held at the Manhattan offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm representing Sears, concluded in the early morning hours of Wednesday.
There remains a chance the deal could fall apart, as it still must be documented and approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge. A hearing is expected to be scheduled for later this week.
A group of creditors is objecting to the deal, one of the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Spokespeople for Sears and ESL did not immediately return requests for comment.
Lampert's only challenger in the auction was Sears itself, and how much it would reap in a sale of its businesses and assets in pieces, the people said. 
The deal faced a number of hurdles before the sides reached an agreement. 
A creditor group had been calling for its liquidation, saying they would recover more in a wind-down and through lawsuits against ESL for deals it had done with Sears in the past. Lampert has said they were proper. 
Sears had believed Lampert's earlier bids fell short of covering the bills the retailer has racked up since filing for bankruptcy protection in October. A bedrock principle of bankruptcy cases is that those expenses must be fully repaid.
The retailer is one of the highest-profile victims of the financial carnage in retail to date as online shopping on sites including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared in popularity. 
Unlike Sears, which plans to remain in business, toy seller Toys ""R"" Us Inc and department store The Bon-Ton Stores Inc closed down last year after losing the support of debt investors or failing to find a buyer.
Lampert, Sears' biggest lender and shareholder before it filed for bankruptcy, merged the department store with discount chain Kmart in 2005 in an $11 billion deal.

Handelsblatt, citing government sources, said government officials were discussing setting security standards that Huawei could not achieve, effectively blocking its participation. Changes to the German telecommunications law were also under consideration as a last resort, the paper said.
The deliberations would mark a shift from the German government's position in October, when it told lawmakers it saw no legal basis to exclude any vendors from an upcoming 5G auction following warnings from Washington.
The government told lawmakers in a more recent response that the security of 5G networks was ""extremely relevant"", and would guide its upcoming decisions, Handelsblatt reported. 
U.S. officials have briefed allies that Huawei is ultimately at the beck and call of the Chinese state, while warning that its network equipment may contain ""back doors"" that could open them up to cyber espionage.
Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) announced in December that it would review its vendor strategy and France's Orange said it would not hire the Chinese firm to build its next-generation network in France.
The shift by the national market leaders, both partly state owned, followed Huawei's exclusion on national security grounds by some U.S. allies, led by Australia, from building their fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks.
Huawei says the security concerns are unfounded. Tensions have been heightened by the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada for possible extradition to the United States.
Handelsblatt quoted Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei as saying his company had never received a request from a government to transmit information in violation of any regulations. 

""I love my country, I support the Communist Party, but I would never do anything that would harm another country in the world,"" it quoted him as saying.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 05:52PM ET</span>",Trump 'inclined' to impose new U.S. auto tariffs: senator,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to move ahead with tariffs on imported vehicles, a move that could prompt the European Union to agree a new trade deal, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley on Wednesday.
""I think the president's inclined to do it,"" the Republican senator told reporters. ""I think Europe (is) very very concerned about those tariffs ... It may be the instrument that gets Europe to negotiate.""
U.S. Commerce Department recommendations into whether Trump should impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds are due by mid-February. A Commerce Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
Grassley, who has had regular talks with Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on trade issues, said he did not like new tariffs but ""they are a fact of life when Trump is in the White House."" He said they may have been an ""effective tool"" in getting China, Canada, Mexico and others to negotiate on trade.
Iowa senator Grassley also wants the EU to agree to include agricultural issues in trade talks, although EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said last week the 28-country bloc could not negotiate on agriculture.
The White House has pledged not to move forward with imposing tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it is making constructive progress in bilateral trade talks.
Trump has urged the EU to drop its 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles. The U.S. passenger car tariff is 2.5 percent, while it imposes 25 percent tariffs on pickup trucks.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose new auto tariffs.
""Cars is the big one,"" Trump said last year.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office last week published its objectives for EU talks, including seeking comprehensive agriculture access.
The prospect of 25 percent tariffs sent shockwaves through the auto industry, with U.S. and foreign-brand producers lobbying against it.
German automakers met with Trump in December to urge him not to impose tariffs. On Monday, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said it would invest $800 million in its Chattanooga, Tennessee operations and add 1,000 jobs to build electric vehicles. That drew praise from Trump. 
Automakers say imposing 25 percent tariffs would raise cumulative prices for U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. They argue there is no evidence auto imports pose a national security risk.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) , VW and Toyota Motor Corp, warned tariffs would boost imported car prices by nearly $6,000 on average.

Earlier this week, Senators Doug Jones and Lamar Alexander re-introduced legislation to delay any 25 percent auto tariff and require the International Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive study before tariffs could be applied.

1. Netflix Kicks off Tech Earnings
While there are plenty of earnings scheduled ahead of trading tomorrow, the big report comes after the closing bell as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), one of the famous FAANGs, issues its results.
Big things will be expected as the stock has been on a tear. It’s up more than 31% since the start of the year, getting a major boost recently when it said it would be raising streaming subscription prices. The shares' 28.5% tumble in the 2018 fourth quarter pressured stocks overall.
On average, analysts expect that Netflix earned 25 cents per share in the latest quarter on revenue of about $4.2 billion.
But the real focus will be on streaming subscriber numbers.
Netflix said it expects 7.6 million paid net additions and 9.4 million total net additions (which includes free trials).
2. Morgan Stanley, American Express on Tap
Among the aforementioned before-the-bell earnings,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) continues the parade of financial results.
Financial earnings and revenue have been strong so far, and Morgan Stanley is expected to post a profit of 90 cents per share with revenue of about $9.35 billion.
Also in the sector,  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) reports after the close.
On average, analysts forecast a profit of $1.80 per share on revenue of about $10.6 billion.
3. Jobless Claims, Philly Fed on Calendar
On the economic calendar tomorrow, the latest weekly jobless claims figures arrive at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits for the latest week are expected to rise slightly to 219,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and affiliate Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) said on Wednesday they will recall about 168,000 U.S. vehicles at risk of fuel leaks, after recalling them in 2017 for engine fire risks, and will offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles.
A high-pressure fuel pipe may have been damaged or improperly installed as part of an engine replacement during the prior recall, and that installation could increase the risk of fire, the companies said. 
The Korean automakers said the software update aims to protect the vehicles from internal damage, and they will also offer new extended warranties for engine issues. The ""knock sensor"" software detects vibrations indicating the onset of excessive wear on the connecting rod bearing.
Kia said that 20 percent of the vehicles involved have already received the update.
The new recall covers 68,000 various Kia Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles from the 2011 through 2014 model years, while Hyundai said it affects 100,000 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and 2013-2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport vehicles.
Kia said six fires are linked to the new recall but no reports of injuries, while Hyundai said it had no reports of fires linked to the new recall.
In May 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the recalls of nearly 1.7 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine defects.
In November 2018, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Korean auto affiliates Hyundai and Kia https://reut.rs/2VVMwYm to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects were conducted properly, citing a person with knowledge of the matter and documents. The companies declined to comment.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same “Theta II” engines.
In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with “Theta II” engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris.
On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.
The recall, which was also conducted in Canada and South Korea, cost the automakers an estimated 360 billion won ($319.3 million). The nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in October called for the immediate recall of another 2.9 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine fire risks.

A NHTSA spokeswoman declined to comment because of the partial U.S. government shutdown. The auto safety agency is not reviewing recall submissions or posting new recall campaigns on its website.

660,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",U.S. May Reportedly Soon Indict Chinese Telecom Huawei,"Investing.com - Federal prosecutors may soon indict Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. partners including T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), accoridng to a published report.
The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday the criminal probe stems in part from T-Mobile's successful suit that found Huawei liable for misappropriating robotic technology used to test smartphones at T-Mobile's lab in Bellevue, Wash. In 2017, a Seattle jury awarded T-Mobile $4.8 million in the case, originally filed in 2014.
The U.S. has been scrutinizing Huawei for some time because of concerns the company's gear could be used to spy on Americans. The probe has effectively blocked the Chinese company from installing its equipment in major U.S. networks. The investigation comes amid a broad push by the Trump administration to aggressively pursue claims of intellectual property theft and technology transfer by Chinese companies, the Journal said.
The company had no comment on the report, the Journal said. The Justice Department also declined comment. But company founder Ren Zhengfei said at a rare news conference Tuesday that Huawei hasn’t -- and would never -- spy on behalf of the Chinese government.
Pressure on Huawei has been growing. Ren's daughter, the company's chief financial officer, was detained last month in Canada on suspicion of misleading banks about the company's relationship with Iran. Polish authorities arrested a Huawei executive last week on espionage charges.

MOBILE, Ala. (Reuters) - Airbus SE expanded its industrial presence in the United States on Wednesday, starting construction on a new assembly plant for the Canadian developed A220 jetliner, 18 months after agreeing to buy the plane in the midst of a U.S.-Ottawa trade dispute.
The European planemaker said it would invest $300 million and create 400 jobs in the plant, to be built in the port of Mobile alongside an existing assembly line for its best-selling A320 passenger jet, which already employs 700 people.
Alabama and the city of Mobile would provide a total of some $26 million in state and municipal incentives to support the development, officials said.
Speaking to an audience of Alabama politicians and aerospace workers, Chief Executive Tom Enders hailed a ""day of pride"" for Airbus at a ceremony peppered with patriotic U.S. references and highlighting other investments in helicopters and satellites.
There has been an increase in aerospace investment in the southeastern United States, where U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has a plant assembling long-haul 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina.
Airbus plans to use the Mobile site to assemble the 110-130-seat A220 for U.S. airlines, which have ordered 250 of the planes including 135 since Airbus took control last July.
The decision to produce some A220's in the United States was initially seen as a trade boost for Canada after Boeing accused its developer Bombardier Inc of dumping the foreign-made jet at low-ball prices to win a deal with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL).
Although Boeing ultimately lost its trade case, Airbus said it still made sense to serve U.S. demand from the Alabama site.
""The United States is one of the largest markets for us and this is our largest industrial base in the U.S. We have the skills and employees and it is the logical thing to do,"" Airbus Americas CEO Jeff Knittel said.
Airbus plans to build 4 A220s a month in Alabama with the first jet to be delivered in 2020. The Montreal base for the aircraft is running at some 2.75 A220 jets a month with plans to raise capacity to 10 a month by the mid-2020s.
The Alabama production line for the larger A320, which opened in 2015, produces 4.5 aircraft a month and this could rise to five a month by the end of the year, Knittel said.

Airbus first studied using the Mobile site for a proposed tanker for the U.S. Air Force, sweetening the bid with an offer to build commercial freighters. Airbus lost out to Boeing in 2011 after a long and politically charged contest.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 04:44PM ET</span>",U.S. IRS to waive 2018 penalties for under-withheld taxpayers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government tax agency said on Wednesday it would not impose penalties on many taxpayers who had too little federal income tax withheld from their pay last year, or who paid less than their estimated tax liabilities. 
In a concession that follows a sweeping U.S. tax overhaul enacted in late 2017, the Internal Revenue Service lowered its threshold for waiving the penalty to help taxpayers affected by tax law changes ushered in by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Tax penalties will be waived generally for taxpayers who have paid at least 85 percent of their total liability through withholding, quarterly estimated tax payments or a combination of the two, the IRS said. The threshold is usually 90 percent. 
The IRS released updated federal tax withholding tables early in 2018 to reflect adjustments in the tax law. But tax authorities later acknowledged that the tables did not fully factor in some changes including exemptions for dependents and reduced itemized deductions.
The new policy also comes at a time when the IRS has been hit by a partial government shutdown, now in its 26th day, with no end in sight. The agency said earlier this week it would bring more than 46,000 furloughed employees back to work without pay to handle annual tax returns, refunds and other tasks.
About one-quarter of the federal government shut down on Dec. 22 over President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Democrats oppose.
The U.S. tax filing season is set to begin on Jan. 28 and last until the April 15 filing deadline. Democrats, who criticized its withholding tables as inaccurate last year, are now raising questions whether the IRS can provide refunds on time.
""We realize there were many changes that affected people last year, and this penalty waiver will help taxpayers who inadvertently didn't have enough tax withheld,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement.

""We urge people to check their withholding again this year to make sure they are having the right amount of tax withheld for 2019,"" he said.

663,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Extends Gains as Financials Flourish on Bullish Banks,"Investing.com – The Dow closed higher for a second day in a row Wednesday, led by a surge in financials as upbeat quarterly results from Wall Street banks raised investor optimism on earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.59%. The S&P 500 gained 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.15%.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) delivered fourth quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending their shares up 7.2% and 9.6%, respectively. Goldman's gain added 116 points to the Dow's gain by itself.
Financials were also boosted by a rise in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) despite reporting earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates.
Some market participants appeared to give the company the benefit of the doubt, citing an attractive valuation.
""Currently trading at 14.3 times our 2019 earnings per share estimate and yielding 3.2%, with the dual catalysts of a growing and recurring technology servicing revenue base and the secular tailwinds associated with ETFs, we view Blackrock as undervalued versus historical levels,"" said CFRA, an independent researcher.
Financials rose 2.20% as the sector continues clawback losses of 15% over the past year.
In other earnings news, United Continental's (NASDAQ:UAL) better-than expected earnings, reported Tuesday after markets closed, lifted its shares more than 6% higher.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) also ended the day higher.
The gloomy backdrop for retailers, meanwhile, continued to hurt performance, with shares of Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) falling 4.8% after it reported soft same-store sales growth on full price merchandise, prompting a downgrade to neutral from buy Goldman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs said Nordstrom's pre-announced holiday sales confirmed a ""marked deceleration"" in the full-price business, citing weaker store traffic as a concern, as it arrived in a period in which ""the consumer is strong and where news from other mall-based retailers on traffic has been more mixed.""
The mostly bullish earnings and stable guidance reported so far, has helped the broader market extend gains, though the Fed's Beige Book showed that businesses are starting to feel the pressure of rising input costs, which could compress margin.
""Reports cited rising materials and freight prices as sources of cost increases, and a number of Districts said that higher tariffs were also a factor,"" the Beige Book showed.
Gains in the broader market were held back, however, on concerns about rising U.S.-China tensions after Bloomberg reported that federal prosecutors are investigating Huawei Technologies for allegedly stealing trade secrets.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 04:32PM ET</span>",Upbeat bank earnings send Wall Street to one-month highs,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes hit one-month highs on Wednesday as strong earnings from Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) boosted investor sentiment.
Goldman Sachs shares surged 9.5 percent, providing the greatest boost to the Dow, after the bank reported quarterly revenue and earnings that topped estimates. The shares registered their biggest daily percentage gain in nearly 10 years.
Bank of America shares jumped 7.2 percent, leading the S&P 500 higher, after the bank reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on growth in its loan book. The shares posted their biggest one-day percentage gain in 6-1/2 years. 
The two banks' results drove a 2.2 percent gain in the S&P 500 financial index (SPSY), which was by far the biggest advancer among the S&P's major sectors. The S&P banking subsector <.SPXBK> climbed 2.7 percent.
A strong start to the U.S. earnings season, along with trade optimism and hopes of a slower pace in the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes, have helped S&P 500 recoup some of its losses from a recent rout. The index is now 10.7 percent away from its Sept. 20 record close after having fallen as much as 19.8 percent below that level.
""Overall, banks need a good economy and a properly sloped yield curve, and maybe we're getting that,"" said Kevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. ""We're starting to see that percolate into bank earnings.""
With Wednesday's gains, the S&P 500 came within striking distance of its 50-day moving average, a key indicator of short-term trends, for the first time since Dec. 4. The Nasdaq crossed its 50-day moving average on Tuesday for the first time since Dec. 3.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 141.57 points, or 0.59 percent, to 24,207.16, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 5.8 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,616.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 10.86 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,034.69.
Stocks slightly pared gains in the last half-hour of trading after the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. businesses.
Among other stocks, United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) shares rose 6.4 percent after the airline posted a quarterly profit that beat expectations.
Shares of  First Data Corp  (N:FDC) soared 21.1 percent after  Fiserv Inc  (O:FISV) said it had agreed to buy the payment processor for $22 billion in the biggest-ever deal within the digital payments industry. Fiserv's shares fell 3.3 percent.
 Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) shares fell 4.8 percent after the department store forecast full-year profit at the lower end of its prior estimates.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) shares dropped 6.2 percent after the automaker forecast a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter profit and said tariffs could erode its 2019 earnings.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 19 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.48 billion shares, compared to the 8.69 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) aims to make a decision this year on the future of its CRJ regional jet as it ""aggressively"" pursues new orders to secure its industrial future, the Canadian planemaker's chief executive said on Wednesday.
The company is exploring ""all strategic options"" for the loss-making program including a potential sale, but its immediate focus is to win orders and cut costs, CEO Alain Bellemare told Reuters.
Asked whether Bombardier would reach a decision this year, he said, ""I hope so, for sure. The more certainty we can provide the better but we are getting good traction"".
Bellemare was speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony marking a new U.S. assembly line for the larger A220 jetliner development, which Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell to a venture led by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR).
Bombardier, which had struggled to keep pace with the huge cash demands of a new aircraft program, later sold its older Q400 turboprop program and announced a review of the 20-year-old CRJ series.
""I don't want to drag this on for too long but a lot of that is not in my hands; it is also in customers' hands,"" Bellemare said.
""We are trying to see how we build a backlog. For us to keep this thing going we need to have a skyline (future production profile) that makes sense. We are willing to maybe reduce our production volume but at the same time we need to have sufficient volume to feed the supply chain,"" he added.
""We are very aggressive right now. We are working aggressively with airline customers. That's our number one priority.""
Analysts say adding new orders and lowering costs are measures designed to throw the aging CRJ program a lifeline and make it more attractive to long-term investors.
The CRJ competes with Embraer (SA:EMBR3) regional jets and is helped by union ""scope clause"" rules in the United States restricting the size of jets used by regional airlines.

Bellemare played down concerns that the clauses could be renegotiated, hurting demand for the CRJ, saying they had historically been hard for airline managements to change.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",French government calls for Renault board meeting to replace Ghosn,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday the government had requested a  Renault  (PA:RENA) board meeting in coming days to replace the company's scandal-hit Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn.
The company needs a change of governance, Le Maire said in an interview with French TV station LCI, confirming an earlier Reuters report that France wanted a new Renault leadership.
""We have to move to a new phase,"" the minister said.
The government, Renault's biggest shareholder, had publicly supported the company's decision to keep Ghosn in office while he awaits trial in Japan for alleged misconduct at Nissan (T:7201), the French carmaker's alliance partner which he also chaired until his dismissal in November.
Behind the scenes, however, the state had begun seeking candidates to replace Ghosn in November and December, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. 
Renault's nominations committee is now expected to meet on Jan. 20, a source with knowledge of the matter said, followed by a full board meeting as soon as Monday under the interim chairmanship of Philippe Lagayette.
Headhunter Korn Ferry has been advising Renault management on succession matters, with Emeric Lepoutre & Partners acting for the government.
Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), is likely to replace Ghosn in his chairman role, according to sources.
The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the CEO job currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore.
Others under consideration include senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy and  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) boss Philippe Guillemot, a person involved in the discussion said.
Elior has denied Guillemot was a candidate, but acknowledged he may have been considered.
Le Maire endorsed Senard as a ""great industrialist"" when asked about his potential candidacy.
The move to replace Ghosn follows a Tokyo court decision to deny his request for release on bail, increasing the likelihood he will remain in jail for months. 
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in an interview on Monday he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.

(Reuters) - SQN Investors LP said on Wednesday Yelp Inc's shares could surge to between $55 and $65, up to 80 percent above its current price, if the customer review company appoints new board members and considers selling itself.
SQN, one of the biggest shareholders in Yelp with a more than 4 percent stake, said investors ""must seize opportunity"" to refresh board with three new directors, including stockholder representation.
The refreshed board will evaluate options such as possible sale of the company as an immediate private equity-led buyout could fetch $47 to $50 per share.
SQN said that Yelp should partner with companies like GrubHub Inc and ANGI Homeservices Inc and could alternatively seek potential bidders such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Shares of Yelp were up 3.3 percent at $36.13 in late afternoon trading.
In response to SQN's recommendation, Yelp said it was looking for additional board candidates and ""is open to hearing any ideas and investor input, including from SQN"".
In the past several quarters, Yelp has struggled to grow, with revenue growth decelerating to high-single digits. 
""We see Yelp's challenges as mainly structural – exploiting the local internet market is a difficult task. We would argue that GrubHub has been the most successful in that endeavor,"" DA Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.
Last month, SQN called for an overhaul of the company's board and appointment of new independent directors.

""We remain willing and open to meeting with SQN to hear their perspectives on the topics they have previously raised, all of which are items on which the Board has already been engaged,"" Yelp said.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) turned in a better-than-expected profit during David Solomon's first quarter at the helm, helped by dealmakers in the division the new chief executive once oversaw.
A 56 percent jump in M&A fees as well as higher equities trading revenue during a volatile quarter for stocks helped offset another decline in bond trading, a business whose structural issues have forced Goldman to rethink its overall business model.
Shares of the fifth-largest U.S. bank surged more than 8 percent in midday trading on Wednesday.
Using a plan Solomon co-developed in 2017, Goldman Sachs is trying to generate $5 billion in additional annual revenue by growing its consumer operation, wooing new institutional customers and convincing existing clients to do more business with the bank.
""We will not be complacent waiting for the market to return,"" Solomon said on a conference call with analysts, referring to bond trading.
The comments broke with a precedent set by previous CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who did not publicly speak to analysts each quarter.
Solomon also addressed Goldman's involvement in the Malaysian 1MDB scandal, apologizing for a former employee's role while defending the broader bank's innocence. [L3N1ZG46A]
Goldman reported a profit of $2.3 billion, or $6.04 per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with a loss of $2.1 billion, or $5.51 per share, in the year-ago period when the bank took a big one-time hit from the U.S. tax code overhaul. 
Analysts had expected a profit of $4.45 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts said the bank handily beat consensus expectations when taking into account one-time items. 
Goldman's total revenue was $8.1 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $7.6 billion. The biggest line-item gain was the $1.2 billion of M&A advisory fees Goldman reported.
The bank's $1.6 billion of quarterly equities trading revenue was up 17 percent, with bond trading revenue dropping 18 percent to $822 million. Goldman took in more than $6 billion in quarterly bond-trading revenue at the business's peak.
Goldman tends to be more sensitive to market fluctuations than peers that have large, stable revenue streams from other businesses. 
Even so, Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) reported similar trends this week, with their bond trading down 15 percent to 21 percent. The industry also reported declines in stock and bond underwriting revenue, which was expected.
Under Solomon's plan, Goldman is trying to look more like its rivals by growing its fledgling consumer bank, expanding further into wealth management and building a corporate cash management business.
Growing deposits from consumers and businesses will also help Goldman lessen its cost of funding. The bank has so far gathered $35 billion in deposits from its Marcus consumer business, including $7 billion from its recent expansion into the United Kingdom, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on the call.
Despite its efforts, Goldman's shares have been underperforming peers due to worries about its possible exposure to 1MDB-related costs.
""The 1MDB situation is like the real hold up for people right now,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.
The bank added $844 million to its legal and regulatory provisions last year, more than four times what it set aside in 2017, though it did not specify the purpose.
Goldman's stock has fallen 30 percent over the last 12 months, and is trading at a discount to its tangible book value.

U.S. money market funds, which are seen only a tad riskier than bank accounts, posted a $17.00 billion drop in assets to $3.012 trillion in the week ended Jan. 15, the Money Fund Report said on Wednesday.
Withdrawals from money market funds in the latest week reversed prior weeks' heavy inflows, as stock markets around the world showed some stabilization after being rattled in the last weeks of 2018 and early 2019 on worries about a global economic slowdown, analysts said. 
Taxable money market fund assets declined by $16.22 billion to $2.867 trillion, led by a $16.03 billion drop in assets among institutional government funds, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
Tax-free assets fell by $775.80 million to $145.76 billion, 
The seven-day simple yield on taxable money-market funds averaged 2.03 percent, down from 2.07 percent the week before, while the average seven-day simple yield for tax-free and municipal money-market funds slipped to 0.98 percent from 1.19 percent the previous week, iMoneyNet said.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - International companies with regional headquarters in Kenya said on Wednesday that a deadly militant attack on an upscale Nairobi hotel complex would not scare them away from a city that has long been East Africa's business hub.
At least 14 people were killed and about 700 evacuated under fire after gunmen stormed the upscale dusitD2 hotel and office complex on Tuesday. Hotel guests and workers from companies like  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) had to hole up for several hours while the attackers were hunted down and killed.
The raid echoed a 2013 assault by Islamist militants on an Israel-built shopping center in the same neighborhood that killed 67 people: Images beamed across the world during that assault dented Kenya’s image abroad and scared off tourists, damaging a vital sector of the economy. 
Among Nairobi's other potential deterrents are sporadic political violence that erupts during elections.
But companies say the latest attack won't alter their plans to work in the region's richest city.
""We are very committed to Nairobi. GE is very committed to Kenya,"" said Brenda Mbathi, executive director for government affairs in East Africa at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). 
The American conglomerate set up its regional headquarters for sub-Saharan Africa in Nairobi in 2011, and now provides medical equipment to the Kenyan government and turbines to private power plant developers. 
Convenient flights, a skilled English-speaking workforce and advanced information technology infrastructure have persuaded multinationals like GE and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc to set up regional hubs in the city.
The influx has helped shore up Kenya's long-held position as East Africa's wealthiest economy amid tough competition from other regional countries and Dubai to play a regional hub role.
The attack was claimed by Somali group al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate fighting to topple Somalia's weak U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law. 
BUFFER ZONE
Neighboring Kenya has been a periodic target for al Shabaab after sending troops into Somalia to try to create a buffer zone along the porous border.
But robust economic expansion, estimated at 6.0 percent last year, has helped boost investor sentiments, although rising government debt levels have stoked concerns. 
Snehar Shah, managing director for East Africa at British solar power firm Azuri Technologies, pointed out that Kenya was not the only country that had suffered attacks. 
""We still believe that Nairobi is a hub for the region and we are very committed to being here,"" Shah told Reuters.
""This is also happening in places like London and it didn't stop business and tourism.""
Google Africa, whose offices are near the hotel complex attacked, echoed his sentiments.
""We are here in Kenya for the long haul,"" said Dorothy Ooko, their head of communications. 
Google lost some of its partners in the attack, including American Jason Spindler, the CEO of investment firm I-Dev International, part of Google's local start-up and developer network.
At the East Africa headquarters of U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (UBER.UL), staff were co-ordinating free rides to and from selected Nairobi hospitals for blood donors. 
""Uber continues to stand in support of the Nairobi community as we recover from this devastating act,"" said their spokesman for East Africa.
1998 BOMBING
Such stoicism reflects a realization that East Africa was not really getting more dangerous, said Ed Hobey-Hamsher, senior Africa analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.
""One-off attacks will embarrass the Kenyan government but will not jeopardize its stability,"" he said.
Kenya has a record of resilience. Its economy recovered strongly from the 1998 bombing by al Qaeda’s East Africa cell of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi which killed more than 200 people.
In the important tourism sector, which has attracted a wave of foreign investments recently from global chains like Hyatt Hotels and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, executives also stood firm.
""I don't see any cancellations and no one has cut short their stay,"" said Mohamed Hersi, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation, an umbrella body of hoteliers, tour operators and airlines.
The industry was encouraged by the swift security response that killed the attackers in less than 24 hours, he said.
Earnings from tourism, one of the top sources of foreign exchange, surged 31 percent last year to 157.4 billion shillings ($1.55 billion), the tourism ministry said on January 7.
The Nairobi Securities Exchange, a gateway for foreign investors into the fast-growing economies of East Africa, said trading had carried on normally on Wednesday.
""Despite the efforts by the terrorists to instill fear and destabilize our country, Kenya is a strong and resilient country. Today's market performance was stable,"" the bourse said in a statement.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",Fiserv to buy First Data for $22 billion to boost payments business,"By Siddharth Cavale and David French
(Reuters) - U.S. financial technology provider  Fiserv Inc  (NASDAQ:FISV) said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy payment processor First Data Corp in a $22 billion all-stock deal, the biggest ever acquisition in the booming market for digital payments.
The deal illustrates how providers of commoditized banking services are seeking to diversify by developing or acquiring technology that powers transactions such as credit card purchases and payments through a mobile phone.
Fiserv, one of the biggest technology providers to banks by revenue, said in a statement the acquisition enables it to offer services to financial clients, from enrolling new customers to providing multiple ways to handle physical or digital payments.
A source familiar with the deal said Fiserv had studied several payments firms before starting talks with First Data in October.
A view that First Data was undervalued also gave Fiserv confidence to pursue the deal, the source added. 
Despite its strong market position for payments, especially in the United States, First Data has been weighed down by heavy debts from a $29 billion leveraged buyout led by private equity firm KKR & Co Inc in 2007.
First Data became publicly traded again in 2015, although its share performance has lagged since then, despite efforts by First Data Chief Executive Frank Bisignano, a former top JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) executive, to reduce leverage levels.
KKR, owner of 39 percent of First Data's common stock, will hold 16 percent of the combined company and receive a board seat. 
Fiserv said it had secured debt to refinance First Data's existing $17 billion of obligations, and planned to return to its historical leverage levels within 24 months after the deal closes.
Fiserv will offer $22.74 for each First Data share, a premium of nearly 30 percent over Tuesday's closing price.
After the deal's expected closing in the second half of 2019, Fiserv shareholders will own 57.5 percent of the combined company and First Data shareholders the rest.
First Data's shares rose 20.7 percent to $21.17, while Fiserv fell 4.2 percent to $71.87, giving it a market value of about $28.6 billion.
Fiserv CEO Jeffery Yabuki will become CEO and chairman of the combined company, while First Data's Bisignano will be chief operating officer.
JPMorgan Chase acted as financial adviser to Fiserv, and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) represented First Data. The companies' respective legal advisors were Sullivan & Cromwell and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

E-mini S&P (March)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at 2605.50, up 25.00
Fundamentals: U.S benchmarks are holding ground after extending gains on the year yesterday. Tech took the leadership role it has become accustomed to, the NQ gained 2% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted a monster 6.5% gain after announcing a subscription increase ahead of earnings after the bell today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and all notched sessions of +3.5 – 2.0%. Healthcare was also on fire, but the bigger story is the banking sector chipping-in. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was initially down more than 3% premarket after reporting earnings but gained as much as 1.5% intraday before finishing +0.7%.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is up 8.3% on the week and adding another 1.25% premarket this morning.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) slipped but this went by the wayside in anticipation of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America who reported this morning. Those two stocks have more than responded to healthy reports by gaining 2.5 and 4.5% premarket.
All things considered, this is a great response to the start of earnings season. It has also helped drowned out a Brexit debacle and the government shutdown entering its 26th day. Yesterday, U.K Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal had the worst Parliamentary reception in modern British history, and this has led to a ‘No Confidence’ vote today at 1:00 pm CT. Overall, the reaction across markets has been muted; the British Pound is in the green on the week and global equity markets are broadly higher. This is because she is expected to survive today’s test, otherwise, we imagine markets would be in a bit of disarray. Today, PM May reiterated the intent to leave the EU on March 29th and would only delay upon a credible alternative. We noted here yesterday that Germany’s Finance Minister was open to further discussions but added they are unlikely to make any major changes. Traders must keep a pulse on developments on this front and the risks associated with such.
The U.S government shutdown has slimmed the economic calendar. Retail Sales was a critical casualty this week, it was due today. The Fed releases their Beige Book at 1:00 pm CT.
Crude Oil (February)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $52.11, up $1.60
Fundamentals: Global risk-sentiment remains favorable and this brings a showdown with today’s inventory data. Yesterday, after the bell, the private API survey reported a draw of 650,000 barrels of Crude, however, a combined build for the products of 9.204 mb. Although, they reported that inventories at Cushing fell by 796,000 barrels, it will be difficult for the tape to fight another broad increase in supplies. Expectations for today’s official EIA data come in at -1.323 mb Crude, +2.769 mb Gasoline and +1.565 mb Distillates. This would still be a composite build of 3.011 mb but significantly less than what was reported by API. Considering such, something in line with these expectations that also posts a draw at Cushing should be favorable for the market.
Gold (February)
Yesterday’s close: Settled at $1,288.4, down $2.90
Fundamentals: Gold continues to hold at the $1,290 area in a very constructive manner. Despite a retreat in Treasury prices, the yen and a strengthening dollar, gold has been as resilient as ever. Typically, that trio would weigh heavily on the metal and instead, we view this resilience as a sign of things to come. U.K Prime Minister May faces a ‘No Confidence’ vote today at 1:00 pm CT and uncertainty surrounding the path of Brexit has been a tailwind for the metal despite dollar strength. Retail Sales today was the latest casualty the record-long government shutdown. The Fed does release their Beige Book this afternoon at 1:00 pm CT."
686,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>","Brexit Breaking Point, Crude Unaffected","Despite the noise from the Brexit plan vote and Chinese central bank interventions, crude is being driven by long-term supply pressure notes Phil Flynn, Senior Energy Analyst, The PRICE Futures Group.
They are calling the Brexit vote the biggest parliamentary defeat in the History of the UK and somehow the markets did not seem to care. Poor Prime Minster Theresa May went down to a stinging but expected defeat of her Brexit plan. The vote raised the anger of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker who said: “the risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening’s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European Commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared. I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible.”
He concluded with the warning: “Time is almost up.”
So now the question is whether President Donald Trump or Jean- Claude will get a wall first.
Crude oil trades dipped only modestly after a big day as the U.S. Dollar Index rallied. It came back as it awaited the report from the American Petroleum Institute. The report was bullish for crude but bearish for products, and that is one reason we are seeing prices a bit weaker to start the day. The API reported that crude supply fell by 560,000 barrels. But it was the drop in Cushing Oklahoma that was the more supportive number. The number suggests that hedges are running out and supplies must be delivered. The API reported that in the storage hub, supply fell by 796,000 barrels. Yet another big 5.99-million-barrel build in gasoline and a distillate increase of 3.214 million barrels is suggesting some short-term weakness in demand and transportation problems down in Houston.
Yet, in the big picture there are more signs of an undersupply of oil a few months down the road. OPEC cuts are starting to bite and more dovish central bankers from the United States, China, and the EU assure enough economic juice to keep oil demand growing at a better than expected pace.
Fed Hawk Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is now a dove. She said in a speech: “For now, it seems to me that we should proceed with caution and be patient as we approach our destination. A pause in the normalization process would give us time to assess if the economy is responding as expected with a slowing of growth to a pace that is sustainable over the longer run.”
China's central bank made its biggest daily net cash injection ever, pumping in a record $83 billion dollars via reverse repos. This is another sign that the Chinese will keep pumping up their economy thereby reducing the fears that China’s oil demand might slow.
European Central Bank Leader Mario Draghi also sounded a dovish tone after weaker than expected data in the EU and warned: “There is no room for complacency. A significant amount of monetary-policy stimulus is still needed to support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and headline inflation.”
All in all, this stimulus comes as producers become more cautious. Talk of reduced shale output and cuts in CapX means we are on a clear long-term path to undersupply and a return to much higher prices. In the short term, we have resistance in this area. Long term, it should be taken out. Buy breaks and use weakness to buy long-term option strategies.
Reuters is reporting that the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) plans to launch an electronic auction platform with U.S. energy firm Enterprise Products Partners LP in March to sell U.S. spot crude oil export cargoes. The United States became the world’s largest oil producer last year as shale production hit new highs, encouraging exchanges and pricing agencies to launch new mechanisms to allow companies to price and hedge U.S. oil exports. Enterprise will offer light sweet crude oil from Midland, Texas, to be loaded at the Enterprise Houston Ship Channel (EHSC) terminal in the first auction scheduled to be held in early March, CME said in a statement."
687,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>","Chinese, Shutdown chaos is weigh on GDP Outlook","China weakness, geopolitical risk & the U.S. Government shutdown are all weighing on U.S. economic growth expectations notes Bob Savage.
Markets are making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. The FX market is watching the year of the Pig approach and wonders if the present risk-on mood will see a change. The British pound (GPB/USD) and Chinese yuan (CNY/USD) are not yet flashing the yellow signals that many assume would follow the headlines – where bad news bears down on prices. In the UK, the biggest defeat in House of Commons history has become a victory for the embattled prime minister with the pound higher even as the path to Brexit becomes harder. The hope is that there is a delay and/or a referendum. 
The odds for such are prices at nearly 40%. This leads to UK May more likely to remain in office until June, with those odds over 50%. In China, the lack of progress on structural issues hangs over hopes for a bigger trade deal with the United States. The upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations distort the economy there and squeeze money.
The People’s Bank of China adds a record $83 billion via reverse repos today – trying to offset the New Year squeeze and add to liquidity even after the Required Rate of Return (RRR) cuts have put another $116 billion estimated into the system, and still this isn’t enough. Further, China is seeing the easing of credit lead to the flows into less productive price gains – witness the 9.7% year-over-year house price jump in the big cities. 
For the rest of the world, weaker Japan machinery orders, lower PPI, lower CPI in Europe and in the UK – all suggest that the disinflationary impulses from U.S.-China trade, lower oil prices, lower global trade orders – all are in the works for Q1 and leave central bankers looking a bit overdone on their quest for normalization. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi made that clear yesterday, Carney seems likely to say the same today and many of the Fed – including the hawkish Kansas City Fed President George yesterday pushed for a pause. We are in a world that is waiting for good news but can bear bad news until it overwhelms. Watch the USD/CNY as that barometer as the capital inflows that helped support it are clearly slowing and 6.71-6.73 holds.
Is the US government shutdown hurting growth expectations? 
The effect of the historic partial government shutdown on markets has been modest, but now it’s beginning to hit at economic data releases and the information used by the FOMC to make its decisions. The feedback of private and FOMC surveys continue to show some economic strength for the consumer but the manufacturing sector – as shown from the NY Empire Fed yesterday is getting worse. 
The other effect on GDP for a government shutdown is that the government spending shrinks (although it should bounce back somewhat if/when workers receive back pay). The forecasts for GDP are beginning to get marked down accordingly. The consensus on fourth quarter 2019 GDP is below 1.5%. "
688,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>","Brexit deal rejected, PM May faces Confidence Vote","Rejection of PM May’s Brexit deal is leading to a no-confidence vote, but perhaps a stronger mandate to negotiate next deal notes Fawad Razaqzada.
Theresa May’s Brexit deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last night with 230 votes and we are back to square one. A motion of no confidence in the government was then immediately tabled by the Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, which is expected to take place at 19:00 GMT tonight. If the government loses the no confidence vote then an early general election will be called. But rebel Tory members of Parliament and the Democratic Union Party are both expected to come back on side and back the government, meaning Theresa May is likely to survive. If so, she will have until Monday to come up with an alternative Brexit plan. This time, she will offer cross-party talks with senior parliamentarians to determine what to do next.
Stronger mandate to renegotiate deal?
Although the biggest parliamentary defeat in history for a UK government might give Theresa May a stronger mandate to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU— assuming she passes tonight’s confidence vote— it also raises the prospects of a no-deal Brexit. A second referendum, meanwhile, is still unlikely given that the default position of parliament is to work on a soft Brexit deal with both the current government and the main opposition Labor Party still dismissing the idea of going back to the people.
What does it all mean for the pound?
What this all means is yet more delays, further uncertainty and no progress with time fast running out. This is anything but good for business or consumer confidence. The Bank of England’s wait-and-see stance thus continues. As such, there is no fundamental reason for the pound to move meaningfully higher just yet. Expect further choppy, range-bound, price action on the cable and other GBP crosses, within an overall bearish price structure.
UK inflation eases but the markets don’t seem to care
With Brexit developments – or lack thereof – remaining firmly in focus, the pound barely reacted to the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers released this morning. Granted, the numbers were more or less in line with the expectations, which helps to explain the inaction to some degree. Still, under normal circumstances, volatility does tend to rise around the publication of inflation data. Anyway, for the records, headline CPI eased to 2.1% year-over-year in December, down from 2.3%, but in line with the expectations, while core CPI was 1.9% versus 1.8% expected. Other measures of inflation were mostly weaker than expected, including RPI, HPI and PPI output. According to the Office for National Statistics’ Mike Hardie, the ease back in inflation was partially due to a “big fall in petrol, with oil prices tumbling in recent months… [while] air fares also helped push down the rate.”
Trading the pound
The latest Brexit stalemate is further bad news for swing and long-term position traders, but good for speculators with a much shorter-term focus that trade the ranges and scalp. So, when it comes to trading the pound, it makes sense to remain nimble, take it from one level to the next and move on the next opportunity. That, or completely avoid the pound, if the current market environment is not compliant with your own ideal trading environment.
GBP/JPY retests key 140 level again ahead of confidence vote
It is interesting to watch what the GBP/JPY does around the key 140 resistance level. Yesterday’s defense of this level proved to be temporary, but the kick-back rally was impressive nonetheless. Still, the Guppy hasn’t cleared this hurdle cleanly to suggest a change in the trend. So, let’s see if rates start to breakdown again from here as the Brexit deadlock continues and time runs out.

689,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Marriott hack Highlights Demand for Cybersecurity Investing,"With another major firm announcing that they were victims of a massive hack, investing in the right cybersecurity firm is an investment priority. Jon Markman has a few ideas on that. 
The largest hotel chain in the world just disclosed a giant data breach that happened in November. Some 500 million customer accounts were impacted. Later, Marriott International (MAR) said the theft also includes 5.25 million unencrypted passport numbers.
Potential identity theft and fraud aren’t just keeping guests up at night. Company execs are also losing sleep over cybersecurity worries.
That’s a big opportunity for investors. Even as businesses shore up their digital defenses, hackers grow more sophisticated. Increasingly, they are sponsored by authoritarian states with deep pockets and nefarious longer-term objectives.
According to an Associated Press, FBI analysts believe the Chinese Ministry of State Security is behind the breach at Marriott, which counts among its brands W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, Le Méridien, Four Points and Starwood.
The passport information is especially valuable. It would allow CMSS, the Chinese version of the CIA, to compile detailed dossiers on global political and business leaders. That includes access to their health and financial records.
Combine that with credit card data gathering, and tracking when, where and with whom the target traveled is a cinch. The espionage and blackmail possibilities are endless. And in the digital era, data is everywhere.
Fancy Bear, an elite Russian hacking group, and the GRU, Moscow’s military intelligence service, combined in 2017 to infiltrate hotel Wi-Fi networks in one Middle Eastern and seven European capitals.
The thieves used stolen NSA hacking tools and malicious Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Word macros to silently collect cached usernames and passwords. The code was so sophisticated, users didn’t even have to sign in to become compromised.
The heist was possible because traditional cybersecurity involves building armies of security appliances around applications. Fancy Bear cracked that defense by getting inside the Wi-Fi application.
Zscaler (ZS) builds walls around data, not applications. The San Diego company makes cloud-based, next generation firewalls, sandboxing and vulnerability management software.
The concept is resonating because the security appliances business, currently dominated by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Siemens and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), is hopelessly broken.
Appliances are expensive. They do not scale well. The only way to add more capacity is to buy more appliances. Unfortunately, that increases bottlenecks and latency.
More importantly, appliances have proven no match for sophisticated hackers. To overcome these issues, enterprises are moving data to containers that appliances cannot see.
In 2017, Network World reported the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority moved 75% of its infrastructure to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services to avoid security appliances.
Security Stack-as-a-Service is the future of cybersecurity in the cloud. And the Zscaler Internet Access platform is the technology leader. Zscaler operates the world’s largest Security Stack-as-a-Service. It processes 35 billion requests, with 125,000 unique security updates every day. The cloud architecture means every client, from powerful workstations and laptops, to smartphones and tiny Internet of Things devices, get the same level of security.
When Zscaler finds a threat anywhere, it blocks it everywhere. In the process, customers get better performance and lower costs than security appliances.
The list of converts is long. Even legacy security appliance companies Siemens and General Electric have come around. They are now working with Zscaler to help enterprise customers transform the way they approach cybersecurity.
Zscaler had revenues of $190 million in fiscal 2018, a 51% increase over 2017. Gross income ballooned 55% to $152 million.
Corporate hacks, like the Marriott debacle, represent a big opportunity for cybersecurity firms. Zscaler software gives enterprises the ability to build walls around data, even when networked applications inside delis, taxicabs and hotel rooms have been compromised.
After reaching $47.50 in August, Zscaler shares have fallen back to $41. At 520x forward earnings, shares are expensive. However, this is a high-growth business at the center of digital security.
The prospects are bright. Longer-term investors with some appetite for risk can buy the stock on pullbacks.

690,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: BofA, Goldman Soar, Keeping Financials in Favor","Investing.com – Bank of America and Goldman Sachs rallied on Wednesday, boosting financials, as both Wall Street banks delivered blowout earnings.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results as earnings of $0.70 a share on revenue of $22.74 billion topped estimates for $0.63 a share on revenue of $22.36 billion. Its shares rose more than 7%.
The bank's earnings growth was bolstered by share buybacks and revenue was driven higher by strong consumer banking revenue.
The fixed-income business, however, took some of the gloss off the upbeat quarterly report as revenue fell 15% to $1.45 billion, below expected sales of $1.62 billion, following the market rout in December.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also delivered a beat on the both the top and bottom lines owing to strength in its investment banking and lending divisions, sending its shares 5% higher.
The bank reported earnings of $6.04 a share on revenue of $8.08 billion, handily beating estimates for $4.42 a share on revenue of $7.59 billion.
Goldman’s revenue beat was underpinned by its investing and lending division, which saw revenue swell to $1.91 billion, easily beating expectations for $1.35 billion.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, shrugged off a dour fourth-quarter report, which missed both earnings and revenue estimates as the wild swings in markets dented its asset base. Its shares gained more than 4%.
BlackRock's total assets under management fell to $5.98 trillion, down from $6.44 trillion at the end of the third quarter.
""We had about a 5% decay in our asset base, not because of outflow, but because the market fell,” CEO Larry FinkFink said.
The bullish start to the new year, however, bolstered BlackRock's asset base as Fink told CNBC that the company's assets under management had jumped back above $6 trillion.
The banking sector is up more 9% for the month as it attempts to claw back losses of 20% over the past year."

693,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:19PM ET</span>",Exclusive: ADM CEO says wrong time for 'monster' acquisitions,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Caroline Stauffer
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) has looked at buying rivals including Bunge Ltd. and dozens of other companies but decided the time is not right for ""monster"" acquisitions, the company's chief executive told Reuters. 
ADM's overture to Bunge last year, reported by Reuters and other media, fueled Wall Street speculation of further consolidation among the world's major trading houses that sell, store and ship crops.
""I cannot run ADM and say Bunge is out there, oh, I never made an analysis of Bunge. Of course we do,"" CEO and Chairman Juan Luciano said in a rare interview to discuss M&A strategy. He explained ADM has also analyzed other companies in the past including Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], the other members of the so-called ABCD group of grain traders.
Luciano declined to comment on whether ADM had formally made a bid for New York-based Bunge. ADM is pursuing growth in its nutrition business through smaller acquisitions and potential joint ventures in agricultural processing and other areas, he said. 
""We feel we don't need that monster transformational transaction,"" Luciano said at ADM'S Chicago headquarters. High valuations and M&A competition are also deterrents from large acquisitions, Luciano said. 
""When credit becomes tighter, we might flex our balance sheet a little bit more, when there’s a little bit less competition,"" he said.
Acquiring Bunge would be ""a nice optimization,"" Luciano said. ""But I have a lot of the things that Bunge has,"" so there is ""not a lot of urgency to me."" 
Analysts have said ADM's conservative trading strategy and diversification into flavors and nutrition helped it weather a deep slump in commodity prices better than some rivals during a global soy and corn surplus and the U.S.-China trade war. 
Still, it is the only major trading company without crushing capacity in Luciano's native Argentina, the world's top exporter of soy meal and oil made by processing soybeans. That has increased investor expectations of ADM striking a deal with Bunge or acquiring an Argentine crushing company such as Molinos Agro.
""At the right time, we will go into Argentina,"" Luciano said. He said crushing plants in Argentina were running at around 65 percent capacity and would only fall further if ADM built a new plant, limiting profit margins and further flooding the marketplace.
ADM announced on Friday the acquisition of flavors and fragrances firm Florida Chemical Company (FCC), a division of Flotek Industries, for $175 million. 
    Luciano said ADM evaluates more than 50 companies each year, and added he was open to more joint ventures with competitors, like the one ADM did with privately held Cargill in Egypt. ADM does not have any JVs with Bunge, which was approached by commodity trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc in 2017.
""We don’t have joint ventures with Bunge, candidly, because they were in turmoil during this time,"" he said.
Bunge was particularly hard hit by a global grains glut and currency issues in South America that crimped its profits before the U.S.-China trade war upended global commodities markets. Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero declined to comment, saying only “we are business as usual at Bunge.”
    ADM does not have any joint ventures with Louis Dreyfus Co. either. Louis Dreyfus did not respond to a request for comment. 
TRADE WAR
Luciano said he meets regularly with U.S. and Chinese officials, and believes the countries will resolve their trade war this year, though he worried about long-term tensions.
""I think the longer it lasts, the more it complicates our lives,"" he said, explaining Canadian or Russian soymeal could become alternatives to the United States.
In an example of shifting trade flows, he said ADM had sold U.S. soybeans to Argentina after prices for U.S. beans plummeted when China virtually stopped buying them. Argentina, the world's No. 3 soybean grower after Brazil, was the world's top importer of U.S. soybeans last year.
As part of its corporate strategy in recent years, ADM has sold assets like Brazilian sugar and Bolivian oilseed ventures. ADM is ""90-something percent"" done with its strategic review, he said.
The company's two U.S. dry ethanol mills have been for sale since 2016. Luciano said offers ADM had received were too low. It is holding on to its so-called wet mills, which produce more products than dry mills.

""We are a nutrition company, not a fuel company so ethanol is not our main thrust,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock indexes rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 supported by gains in U.S. bank stocks after strong earnings, while the pound edged up ahead of a no-confidence vote in British Prime Minister Theresa May's government.
Investors saw potential for legislative deadlock forcing London to delay its departure from the European Union following the parliamentary defeat of May's Brexit deal late Tuesday. The no confidence vote is expected at 1900 GMT.
May is expected to survive the vote, sponsored by the main opposition Labour Party. Expectations of a softer Brexit - perhaps incorporating the Labour Party's idea of membership of a permanent customs union - gave support to the pound. 
Sterling  was last trading at $1.2868, up 0.08 percent on the day.
Stocks had mostly priced in the Brexit vote's defeat and were trading higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.52 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.28 percent.
On Wall Street, strong earnings from Bank of America (N:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) as well as a multibillion-dollar deal in the fintech sector kept stocks in positive territory.
""The fact that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citi laid the groundwork for bank earnings not being as bad as markets thought made it easier for Goldman and Bank of America,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 149.65 points, or 0.62 percent, to 24,215.24, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 10.4 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,620.7 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 33.52 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,057.35.
The dollar rose against the euro as the euro zone single currency was pushed lower by worries about the zone's economy, with the euro (EUR=) down 0.11 percent to $1.1402.
Earlier this week, data showed Germany barely escaped a recession in the second half of 2018 and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned on Tuesday the euro zone economy was weaker than anticipated.
In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus German peers in early trade.
U.S. Treasury yields rose as stronger-than-forecast results from two major banks lifted Wall Street, reducing safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.7272 percent, from 2.708 percent late on Tuesday.
Oil prices eased after climbing about 3 percent in the previous session, with worries about the global economy and forecasts of swelling U.S. production hurting sentiment.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were last down 19 cents or 0.31 percent at $60.45 a barrel.
U.S. crude (CLc1) was last down 35 cents, or 0.67 percent, at $51.76 per barrel.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",Investors end 13 straight weeks of U.S. fund withdrawals,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sweetened on financial markets in early January and ended a 13-week retreat from U.S.-based funds, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) said on Wednesday.
U.S.-based stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds attracted a net $11.3 billion during the week ended Jan. 9, while bonds gathered $6.3 billion and commodities took in $711 million, according to the trade group.
Investors fretting over slowing global economic growth and restrictive U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy drained funds in the closing days of 2018. But they have responded positively in the new year as Fed officials have repeatedly suggested that a pause in rate hikes could be appropriate.
Investors pulled $98 billion from U.S.-based stock funds and $77 billion from bonds in December, a calendar-month record, preliminary Lipper estimates show.

January is typically a stronger month than December for fund sales as people reinvest end-of-year capital gains distributions and annual contribution caps reset on U.S. retirement accounts.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>","Ford sees weaker-than-expected fourth quarter, uncertainty in 2019","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) forecast a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter profit and provided a cloudier 2019 outlook due to tariff costs and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union, sending shares down more than 3.5 percent on Wednesday.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker, which is restructuring its operations globally, disappointed analysts by not providing a detailed financial forecast for this year, simply saying earnings and revenue could improve. It said, however, that tariffs could erode 2019 earnings by about $700 million.
""Investor patience is likely to be further tested today as Ford has basically once again said 'your guess' to the financial community with respect to specific financial guidance"" for 2019, Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note. 
This is in contrast to Ford's larger U.S. rival, General Motors Co (N:GM), which last week forecast higher 2019 profit that far surpassed analyst estimates. 
Shares of Ford sank 3.7 percent to $8.51 in midday trading. 
A volatile U.S. trade policy environment and uncertainty around Brexit could impact its performance in 2019, said Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks. 
Ford is the top selling automotive brand in Britain, and a no-deal British exit from the European Union, while unlikely, would be ""catastrophic,"" he said. 
""Until we see how some of these things begin to play out ... we want to be a little prudent in terms of how specific we are,"" Shanks said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference in Detroit. ""But do we think we should improve the business this year? Absolutely.""
TARIFF IMPACT
Ford also expects tariffs imposed by the United States and China, and the impact of higher costs for steel and aluminum, to hurt profits by about $700 million this year, Shanks said.
Tariffs and high commodity costs also hurt its 2018 earnings. 
Nevertheless, Shanks said Ford sees the potential for higher operating earnings, revenue and adjusted operating cash flow in 2019.
Among positive factors will be new product rollouts like the Ford Ranger pickup truck and Explorer sport utility vehicle, its restructuring initiatives, a recovery in China, and the redesign of its money-losing European operations. Ford does not expect a U.S. recession this year.
The company is moving away from sedans and investing more heavily in higher-profit pickup trucks, commercial vans and sport utility vehicles. Ford will invest 90 percent of its capital in trucks and SUVs from 2019 to 2023.
The absence of details provided on its expected profit could point to Ford having less visibility on the market and the challenges it faces, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said. 
""The lack of a formal range is likely to lead to more dispersion of estimates and expectations, making it more challenging to 'hit' investor expectations,"" he said in a research note. ""That could add difficulty to Ford's effort to build market confidence in their turnaround plan."" 
2018 PROFIT 
Ford said it expects 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.30 a share on revenue of $160.3 billion. That's down from its October forecast for operating earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.50, and 3 cents lower than analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
For the fourth quarter, Ford expects adjusted earnings of 30 cents a share, below the 32 cents expected by analysts.
The automaker maintained its quarterly dividend payout at 15 cents a share.
On Tuesday, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said they would join forces on commercial vans and pickups and were exploring joint development of electric and self-driving technology in a bid to save the automakers billions of dollars.
Ford, which is cutting jobs globally, remains committed to its money-losing operations in Europe and South America, president of global markets, Jim Farley, said. Losses in China, where Ford has struggled, will narrow this year, he added.
Last week, Ford said it would cut thousands of jobs and look at plant closures in Europe, as part of its plan to return to a 6 percent operating margin in the region.
In South America, Farley said Ford will improve its manufacturing operations through the VW alliance, but did not provide details.

Nordstrom dipped 7.6% in midday trading as two Wall Street analysts downgraded the company’s stock due to weak trends in its department store business.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded Nordstrom to neutral from buy, while Telsey Advisory Group downgraded it to market perform from outperform, CNBC reported.
The disappointing holiday numbers come on the heels of weakness in other retailers for Christmas, most notably Macy's.
Nordstrom said after the bell Tuesday it now expects its diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to fall on the low end of a previously estimated range of $3.27 to $3.37. Excluding one-time items EPS is expected to be at the low end of $3.55 to $3.65 per share, versus expectations of around $3.60 per share.
Sales for its stores were up 1.3% compared to a year ago, with full-price same-store sales up just 0.3%, the company said.
Online sales rose 18% during the holiday season and accounted for 36% of total sales.
Other retailers were also down, with Macy’s off 2.8% and Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) down 1.2%.  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) slipped 1.7%, while Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) decreased 0.8%. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index inched up 0.07%."

The median pay for Citi's women employees globally was just 71 percent of the median for men, while that for minorities in the United States was 93 percent of the median for non-minorities, the company said, citing an internal analysis.
The third largest U.S. bank also said it would hire more women globally and black employees in the United States to senior roles.
By the end of 2021, it wants at least 40 percent of roles at assistant vice president level through to managing director level to be held by women, and 8 percent of such roles in the United States to be held by black employees.
Currently, more than half of Citi employees globally are women and over 45 percent of its U.S. workforce are minorities, the company said.
""We know we need a comprehensive approach to our diversity initiatives to make the progress we want to see,"" Sara Wechter, head of human resources at Citi, wrote in a blog post http://citi.us/2De3pG8.
Citi, along with other Wall Street banks and financial companies, has been under pressure to disclose how much less it pays women than men.

A 15-year study by the Washington-based Institute for Women's Policy Research found last year that American women earn an average of 39 percent less than men but that this figure rises when taking account of time off for family or childcare.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Executives at the major U.S. automakers are pressing the Trump administration and California to agree on standards for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions through 2025, as risks increase that a deadline for setting national standards will pass without a deal.
Automakers are already entering the time frame when decisions should be made about what engines and fuel-saving technology, such as hybrids or fully electric cars, will be in use in 2021 and beyond, executives said.
In August, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2025 and stripping California of the ability to impose stricter rules. The administration may also eliminate compliance credits that automakers get for making electric vehicles.
Trump’s proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade.
A group of about 20 U.S. states, led by California, has challenged the administration proposal as unlawful and promised to sue if federal regulators move forward with the freeze.
The administration is supposed to finalize the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials question if it will meet that deadline in the wake of the partial government shutdown.
Most automakers oppose freezing the requirements, but also want relief from Obama-era standards that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles.
""Pick the middle. Pick 2.5 percent and get on with life,"" Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) North America subsidiary, told Reuters at the Detroit auto show this week.
Lentz told Reuters last month he was concerned that automakers are stuck between California and the White House. 
""I kind of feel like this is the OK Corral and we're the settlers walking across the middle,"" Lentz said. 
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which floated a compromise proposal last year to other automakers, is still pushing for a deal, Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters. 
""We’ve been very clear and very open that we want one national standard, we want California at the table,"" Ford said. ""We’re not asking for a rollback, but we’ve got to get everybody at the table, especially California.""
Detroit automakers have the most at stake. General Motors Co (N:GM), Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) generate the bulk of their global profits from sales of fuel-thirsty large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States.
Big trucks are front and center at the Detroit auto show, where Fiat Chrysler's Ram brand is displaying a gleaming Ram ""Power Wagon"" heavy duty truck on a pedestal at its show exhibit, and GM's GMC brand is featuring its newly redesigned Sierra Denali luxury pickup line.
Fiat Chrysler, Ford and GM have all discontinued or planned to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and SUVs. 
But Asian automakers that have more efficient fleets are also seeking a middle ground.
Henio Arcangeli, a senior vice president at the U.S. unit of Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), said without a national deal ""the consumer's going to lose.""

Mitch Bainwol, who heads the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major automakers, said a deal makes the most sense but ""time is running out. It has always been true that the biggest impediment to a deal is politics ... A successful negotiation is a win for everyone – more carbon reduction for California, a stronger and pro-job economic context for the administration and common sense certainty for our industry.""

743,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 10:37AM ET</span>",BofA's loan growth drives better-than-expected profit,"By Imani Moise and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp’s (N:BAC) quarterly profit topped analyst estimates on Wednesday as a growing loan book helped it ride out year-end market turbulence, sending the lender's shares up more then 5 percent. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, the Charlotte-based bank has slashed costs while tightening risk controls, boosting overall profitability while weighing on some businesses like investment banking. Over the last decade the bank cut $30 billion in annualized costs, Moynihan said on a call with analysts. 
The second-biggest U.S. bank benefited from 4 percent growth in consumer loans and 2 percent growth in loans to businesses in the fourth quarter, allowing it to capture more revenue from higher U.S. interest rates. Revenue rose in three of the lender's four main businesses. 
Global markets, which includes trading, had a revenue fall that mirrored declines at rivals as market volatility resulted in wider credit spreads and pushed some fixed-income clients to the sidelines. 
Bank of America, with its large deposit pool and rate-sensitive mortgage securities, relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits. 
Its total net interest income, the difference between what a lender earns on loans and pays on deposits, rose 7.3 percent to $12.3 billion. Average deposits rose nearly 2 percent to $1.34 trillion from the preceding quarter.
The results were buoyed by four Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018 and a U.S. strong job market that kept bad loans in check and borrowing healthy. The bank predicted economic growth would slow in 2019 but remain strong. 
Fee income in the investment bank fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees.
Earlier in the week JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) missed profit estimates as its fixed-income trading revenue slumped.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) likewise reported declines in bond trading, citing the market downturn in December.
BofA's adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. The fixed-income weakness was cushioned by an 11 percent rise in equity trading revenue driven by client financing and derivatives. 
Asked why Bank of America did not suffer the same kind of drop in overall trading revenue as JPMorgan and Citi, who reported 11 percent declines each, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told reporters the results reflected the bank's conservative approach.
""We have always said that we are going to run this business in a way that when things are great we may not make as much as some competitors who are swinging for the fences,"" he said. 
While the Fed's forecasts indicate two more rate increases this year, traders are betting the U.S. central bank will not deliver any rate hikes this year and begin cutting rates next year.
But Bank of America executives said there are still indicators pointing to continued economic expansion.
""We still have low inflation, rising wages, low unemployment. And, despite the increase in rates, interest rates remain at all-time lows,"" Moynihan said.
In a conference call with analysts, Donofrio said, ""We don't see anything suggesting a broad-based decline in overall credit quality,"" despite the fact that the bank moved a few loans to non-performing status after borrowers were downgraded for credit quality.
Non-interest expenses fell 1 percent to $13.13 billion as Moynihan works to streamline the lender's sprawling operations. Two years ago he pledged to cut expenses to $53 billion by the end of 2018 and stick to that level until 2020.
Revenue, net of interest expense, rose 11 percent to $22.7 billion.
Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $7.04 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.08 billion, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a nearly $3 billion charge related to changes in U.S. tax law.
Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 08:53AM ET</span>",GM's Washington charm offensive sidelined by Wall Street's push for profit,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) code named its November announcement to cut nearly 15,000 jobs in North America and restructure itself ""Turbo,"" suggesting a leaner approach for the largest U.S. automaker would ""accelerate its transformation.""
Wall Street investors cheered the ambition to get smaller and boost profits. But in Washington, the move remains a public relations crisis that threatens to derail a methodical effort by Chief Executive Mary Barra to keep GM in good graces with the White House and other politicians. 
President Donald Trump called Barra's decision ""nasty"" and said GM had ""better"" find a product to build at a plant in Ohio, a pivotal state for Trump's 2020 re-election effort. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from southeast Michigan and former GM employee, said at the time that GM had become ""the most thoroughly disliked company in Washington.""
At the Detroit auto show this week where GM is faces off with politicians from the states most impacted by its job cuts, Dingell told Reuters that ""GM is going to work hard to improve relationships.""
Despite the angst in Washington, Barra and her deputies are showing no signs of shifting gears. 
""We’re not here to make everybody angry,” GM President Mark Reuss told Reuters this week at the auto show. He said GM’s restructuring is driven by many factors - including the need to offset tariff costs and finance new electric vehicles and battery technology. That requires GM to stop ""investing money in things that don’t make money.""
It is a message Barra herself hit hard on Friday during a presentation to investors in New York, where she promised stronger profits and outlined plans for its Cadillac brand to challenge Tesla Inc. (O:TSLA)
""We have demonstrated time and again that we are willing to make tough and strategic decisions to not only meet our commitments but to secure the company's future,"" Barra said.
Barra's charm offensive had proven successful for most of President Donald Trump's first two years in office. Atop Barra's list of accomplishments: shielding GM's profitable Mexican truck production and its $5 billion investment in its Mexican operations announced in 2014 to double capacity in Mexico from punitive trade measures from the Trump administration.
But the new conflict with Washington comes at a critical time for GM, which wants to sell many more electric vehicles and has been lobbying Congress to expand the $7,500 tax credits. It still needs help from regulators to get self-driving cars without steering wheels on U.S. roads. 
And GM stands to benefit from the Trump administration's plan to weaken fuel efficiency standards 
“We've done this to help you, and I think his disappointment is it seems like they kind of turned their back on him,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters in November, referring to Trump's reaction.
Kyle Martin, research analyst with Westwood Management in Dallas, which owns GM shares, said GM needs the cash to develop to electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle technology. 
""That money has to come from somewhere,"" he said.
WORKING WASHINGTON 
Trump's election win brought a dire warning from GM executives in a presentation in late 2017 and early 2018 to the company's board: an end to the North American Free Trade Agreement could cost the automaker billions of dollars in tariffs on GM's Mexican vehicles. They concluded that the costs would still be less than the billions of dollars and years it would take to shift production to the United States, people briefed on the matter said.
GM argued that while it was building autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles in the United States, it needed to keep generating profits on Mexican-built trucks to fund those operations, people briefed on the talks said.
So Barra made engaging with the White House after Trump's election a key focus, three people briefed on the matter said.
She went to dinner at the house of Trump's daughter Ivanka, and spoke on several occasions with Trump himself. Barra hired a former senior Trump aide who handled trade policy issues, Everett Eissenstat, to run GM's DC office in August.
And she has had numerous talks with U.S. officials, including conversations with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, about the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada - including a key call in August to address concerns from GM that the new trade deal could have disadvantaged its Mexican operations.
Barra is now counting on those relationships to help her steer through 2019, and mend fences in Washington. 
She invited Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to Michigan to attend a board meeting in June 2017 and take a ride in an self-driving car in Michigan, according to previously unreported government records reviewed by Reuters. Barra also had a previously unreported lunch in April 2017 with Chao at the White House with other officials. 
She spent two days last month on Capitol Hill meeting with angry lawmakers and explaining the cuts. In a brief interview with Reuters in December, Barra said she understands ""that there's a lot of emotion and concerns"" but emphasized that the actions were about safeguarding the company's future.
She has her work cut out for her. 
Representative Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat who took office this month, noted the Detroit-Hamtramck plant - one of the facilities losing production - is on a site that GM won approval in the early 1980s to dislocate more than 4,200 people as the state tore down about 1,500 homes and 140 businesses.

""We as a society made a huge sacrifice for GM so they could have a new plant. And 30 years later they are just going to throw it away?"" Levin said. ""We're not going to stop and just say, 'Oh this is a cost of doing business.'""

753,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>","U.S. start-up CommonGrounds raises $100 million, unveils 'hackable' shared office","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - CommonGrounds, a California start-up trying to carve out a niche in the crowded flexible workspace sector with movable office walls, has raised $100 million from three investors, including the Emirati developer of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest skyscraper.
CommonGrounds plans to build 2 million square feet of flexible office space in two years with the Series A funding, one of the largest capital-raising rounds for a commercial real estate venture at such a stage, the San Diego-based firm said.
A build-out of about 50 sites would vault CommonGrounds, which has three locations in California and one in Denver, into a select grouping of U.S. coworking firms. The company declined to say what its valuation was after the fundraising.
Still, it would lag WeWork with its more than $10 billion in backing from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
WeWork raised just $17 million in its Series A funding in early 2012 and did not top $100 million in a single round until late 2013, according to website Crunchbase.
Workspaces with movable office walls have been the Holy Grail in office construction. They boost the flexibility that shared work space operators tout, allowing shorter-term leases, immediate occupancy and minimal planning by management.
However, these systems have not been cost effective and have been plagued by poor quality, lousy acoustics and difficulty in wiring the walls with electricity, said Dan Doyon of Workplace Hospitality Management, a San Francisco coworking consultancy.
""If you can get the price right and solve all the fundamental issues, it obviously makes a ton of sense,"" he said.
CommonGrounds recently reconfigured about 11,000 square foot of workspace used by 130 people in 14 days for $40,000 using a system designed and manufactured by Tecno Spa of Milan, Italy, said Chief Executive Jacob Bates of CommonGrounds.
""Without this building technology it would have taken a minimum 90 days and hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" he told Reuters, highlighting the ""hackable"" environment of its workspace, a phrase it plans to trademark.
CommonGrounds has entered an exclusive contract for the flexible space industry with Tecno Spa, he said.
Investors in the fundraising were Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar Properties (DU:EMAR) in the United Arab Emirates; Bob Davidson, an early developer of educational software and Pacifica Enterprises Inc, which also provided the seed money.
Landlords have sought to partner with coworking firms as it can be 50 percent more profitable than leasing directly to a company, Green Street Advisors said.
U.S. flexible workspace has grown 23 percent annually since 2010, JLL research shows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, reported lower-than-expected quarterly profits on Wednesday, as price cuts and market turmoil overshadowed strong sales of relatively low-cost funds.
Sinking markets in late 2018 led investors to pull cash from the company's typically higher fee actively managed funds even as they delivered record cash to the company's relatively low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Overall, the company sold $43.6 billion in stock, bond and other long-term investment funds, more than the $10.6 billion sold the quarter prior.
But market declines and the company's own price cuts took a bite out of the fees the company earns as a percentage of assets under management. Fees the company collects for hitting certain performance targets and lending out shares to people betting against stocks were also lower than the year prior. Assets under management were just under $6 trillion, down from $6.44 trillion in the preceding quarter.
Net income attributable to BlackRock fell to $927 million, or $5.78 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.30 billion, or $14.01 per share, a year earlier, when it took a one-time gain due to U.S. corporate tax cuts.
Analysts on average expected BlackRock to report $6.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding the restructuring charges and other items, the company earned $6.08 per share, compared with $6.19 per share, a year ago.
BlackRock cut expenses, but not as fast as its revenues fell. The company last week announced cutting about 500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce and booked a $60 million restructuring charge.
Investors now face the prospect that what they saw as one of the few big growth stocks in the asset management business could report lower earnings per share this year.
BlackRock's stock is down nearly a third from an all-time high near $600 per share last year, declining more than 21 percent in 2018. Shares traded around $400 this week and were down 2 percent in light pre-market trading on Wednesday.

""We continue to build and evolve our business in order to stay ahead of clients' needs and industry disruption,"" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in the earnings release.

The firm reported earnings per share of $6.04 on revenue of $8.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $4.42 on revenue of $7.59 billion. That compared to EPS of $5.68 on revenue of $10.93 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported EPS of $6.28 on revenue of $8.65 billion in the previous quarter.
The company's investment banking division reported net revenue of $7.86 billion, thanks to a strong performance in underwriting and the biggest jump in financial advisory revenue since 2007. It also became the first Wall Street bank so far to show growth in trading revenues in the fourth quarter, as a 17% rise in equities trading revenue offset losses from bond trading. 
""We are pleased with our performance for the year, achieving stronger top and bottom line results despite a challenging backdrop for our market-making businesses in the second half,"" Chairman and CEO David Solomon said in a statement.
Goldman Sachs shares gained 3.52% to trade at $186.25 in pre-market trade following the report.
Bank of America earnings, which were announced earlier Wednesday, also beat analysts' expectations, with fourth-quarter EPS of $0.70 on revenue of $22.74 billion. Investing.com analysts expected EPS of $0.63 on revenue of $22.36 billion.
By contrast, JPMorgan had fallen short of forecasts in its fourth quarter, published on Tuesday. It had EPS of $1.98 on revenue of $26.8 billion, compared to forecasts of EPS of $2.20 on revenue of $26.9 billion.

The world's biggest hotel chain said the new brand, Marriott Bonvoy, will replace the existing loyalty programs – Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest - integrating the three brands into one name, with the launch on Feb. 13.
The company, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, disclosed earlier this month that fewer than 383 million customer records were stolen in a cyber attack on its Starwood Hotels reservation system.

Marriott has phased out the Starwood reservations database after it acquired the hotel chain for $13.6 billion in September 2016. The hack began in 2014, a year before Marriott offered to buy Starwood.

757,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",AUD/JPY- The FX-Stock Market Correlation Play,"Divergence between the S&P 500 and AUD/JPY can be a sign that one (or both) of the markets is vulnerable to a reversal. Matt Weller shows you how to exploit it.
One of the first things that new traders to the FX markets learn is that many currencies are correlated with other markets. For instance, the close relationship between crude oil and the Canadian dollar or certain metals and the Australian dollar are intuitive given the importance of exporting those commodities for the Canadian and Australian economies.
One strong, but less obvious, correlation is the tight connection between AUD/JPY and global stock markets. In this case, the factor linking the two seemingly-disparate markets is investors’ risk appetite. When market participants are feeling optimistic about global economic growth, they tend to buy stocks at the expense of more conservative investments such as bonds.
A similar dynamic takes place in the FX market, where upbeat traders will buy higher-yielding currencies with underlying economies leveraged to global economic growth (e.g. the Australian and New Zealand dollars) and sell lower-yielding currencies with relatively stable economies (e.g. the Japanese yen and Swiss franc). This is known as the “carry trade” and is a mainstay of FX traders and global macro strategists.
Conversely, when traders are apprehensive about the potential for global economic growth, they tend to unwind those trades by selling the higher-yielding currencies and buying perceived safe havens. This is the essence of the so-called “carry trade,” a major short- and long-term driver of FX movements.
This strong correlation offers traders several actionable insights. Most straightforwardly, if a trader feels strongly that the broad stock market is due to fall or rise, he/she could use AUD/JPY to express that view in a highly liquid, 24-hour market that offers the potential for leverage. Alternatively, traders can watch for divergences between the S&P 500 and AUD/JPY as a sign that one (or both) of the markets is vulnerable to a reversal.
We saw that exact scenario in Q3 2018, when the S&P 500 rallied to new highs, while AUD/JPY continued to languish. The divergence indicated that stock traders should be more skeptical toward the rally in the S&P 500, and sure enough, the index unwound months’ worth of a gains in a couple of weeks in October. Such divergences can emerge over longer time horizons given the upward tendency of stock investments; they can still provide valuable signals to short-term and swing traders.

758,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",FAANG Stocks Pair Trading,"Paul Cretien illustrates how to execute pairs trades in FAANG stocks.
FAANG is an acronym for the market's five most popular and best-performing technology sector stocks, according to Investopedia. It includes: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG).
The original acronym was FANG, then Apple was added to the group. They are viewed somewhat separately for the rest of the tech sector due to their relative youth and disruptive nature. The group itself provides numerous pairs trading opportunities that should yield profitable trades in 2019. Each stock’s individual performance for 2018 is shown on the chart below.
As you can see, there is a general correlation among the stocks though their performance varies widely. The best pair trading opportunity throughout 2018 and heading into 2019 combined Amazon with Netflix, as their movement was highly correlated, but with enough difference in relative price volatility to create profitable trades.
Volatility differences provide the means for success in pairs trading, as the more stable member of the pair provides a landing place for the volatile member following each spike or dip in its price. For example, from July 8 through Aug. 20, Netflix declined while Amazon increased at a slow, steady pace. Netflix grew at a much sharper pace in the first half of the year until its June peak, which provides a reversion to the mean trade with Amazon. We would look for similar profitable price changes between Netflix and Amazon in 2019.
Other pairs that may be spotted on “FAANG Stocks in 2018” include Apple and Amazon, Facebook and Google, Google and Apple, Apple and Amazon, Apple and Netflix and Amazon and Netflix. Of these pairs, the only one whose two members are too closely paired to be traded is Facebook and Google. For the others, an example trade is shown for each pair, with the more stable member listed first and bought. The more volatile stock is listed second and is sold at the beginning of the trade. The position is exited on the second date.
Of course, the example trades were made easier by selecting dates on the chart. In the real world, it will be up to the trader to follow the progress of the five FAANG stocks to see good pairs trading opportunities. The process is one of looking for a volatile stock that is currently highly-priced relative to a less volatile stock, where both members of the pair have been observed over a period of time long enough for the trader to be acquainted with their typical price movements (or by using the lazy way with trades based on a long-term chart).
Notice that volatility is relative and a stock that is considered the more volatile member of one pair may be considered the stable member when paired with a second stock or at a different date.
Well-considered pairs trades should result in profitable opportunities with only low to moderate risk."
759,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Miller Industries MLR,"For his model portfolio, John Reese, editor of Validea, selects stocks based on the long-standing strategies of some of the market's most legendary investors. For his more aggressive idea for 2019, he looks to an low-tech transportation sector play.
Miller Industries (MLR) is a small cap-stock (about $300 million in market capitalization) that makes tow-trucks and much of the ancillary equipment necessary to get a car out of a ditch. If you’ve ever had a flat tire and called the auto club, then you’ve seen their products.
Miller Industries scores high on my model based on the investment approach of the quintessential quant, James O’Shaughnessy. In simplest terms, O’Shaughnessy’s model is a marriage of a growth strategy and a value methodology. 
In his 1996 book What Works On Wall Street, he termed this marriage the “United Cornerstone”. The United Cornerstone approach seeks to produce the highest rate of return possible for the lowest amount of risk.
It seeks to identify stocks with three important characteristics: persistent earnings growth; a low Price-to-Sale Ratio (or PSR); and, high relative strength. Miller Industries passes on each screen.
The firm’s long-term earnings growth rate stands at an impressive 21.7% and its PSR is a miniscule 0.40. Recently, Miller Industries has produced solid outperformance relative to the broader market and passes on one of the most important points O’Shaughnessy discusses in his book.
He looks for high relative strength because “winners keep winning and losers keep losing.” As of this writing, Miller Industries relative strength stands at a firm 74.
In its most recent annual report Miller Industries discussed having a strong backlog of demand. At the end of 2018 the company completed the expansion of its factories in Tennessee to address that backlog, which suggests to me that their history of persistent earnings growth may well continue throughout 2019.

760,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Twilio TWLO,"Even with a macroeconomic outlook that seems less certain than the past few years, I'm still particularly bullish on the enterprise software services sector that specifically focuses on helping small- to medium-sized businesses as a whole, suggests Matthew Timpane, senior market strategist for Schaeffer's Investment Research.
While I love many high-growth names such as Okta (OKTA), MongoDB (MDB), and Zendesk (ZEN), I'm particularly bullish on a mid-growth name that has a great technical, fundamental, and sentiment setup — Twilio (TWLO), which I believe could prosper in 2019 as it diversifies its customer base away from Uber, which was once 25% of its revenue.
In terms of innovation, Twilio has been busy. In 2018, the company launched general availability of Twilio Flex Roadmap, and pushed Twilio Pay, Autopilot, and Super-Sim out to public beta. Plus, the firm made strategic acquisitions of Ytica and SendGrid.
TWLO is estimated to grow revenues by 28% in 2019, with a robust 54% earnings per share (EPS) growth. While they are no longer considered ""high-growth,"" per se, this EPS increase will be driven by a greater reduction in expense growth. 
In a previous enterprise value (EV)/sales multiple contraction during 2014, mid-growth companies contracted 28% on average, while mid-growth multiples contracted by 31% in October 2018 alone. By comparison, both high-growth and slow-growth contracted by less than their respective 2014 levels.
Twilio's EV/sales multiple contracted to 8.38 during the October volatility, and is expected to grow to 10.07 over the next 12 months. That's still far below 14.85 over the last 12 months, which provides a better valuation for investors even at a higher stock price.
From a technical perspective, Twilio shares have rallied more than 250% year-to-date in 2018, as of this writing. However, I anticipate we could still easily see 50% to 100% share price growth next year as the company continues to expand.
TWLO is trading slightly below $90, which is six times its June 2016 initial public offering price (IPO) of $15. The shares are in an ascending triangle pattern with resistance around $97, and major support at $65.
Currently, the equity's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 50, which could be an area for TWLO to find a near-term bottom, as we so often see in strong, market-leading stocks. Despite the impressive price performance and high-level growth potential for TWLO, there's a significant amount of skepticism priced into the shares.
More than 14% of the equity's float is sold short, and that short-to-float ratio has increased over the past two reporting periods, even as the share price has appreciated amid broader-market turmoil. Likewise, the Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.31 arrives in the 98th annual percentile, indicating short-term traders have rarely been more heavily tilted toward puts over calls on TWLO.
While I expect TWLO to continue to be volatile in 2019, especially with the potential macro conditions that have investors spooked, I expect that dips can be bought until the stock violates a larger trend, like breaking major support at that $65 level.

Gold and the associated juniors have seen share prices decimated. I believe one of the few bright spots in 2018 — Great Bear Resources (Toronto: GBR) (OTC: GTBDF) — will also shine in 2019.
Great Bear Resources is a ""Discovery Group"" company (John Robins group) advancing one of the most exciting recent discoveries in the junior space, the Dixie project in Red Lake, Ontario.
Shares in the company caught fire after drill hole DHZ-004 retuned 44.47 g/t gold over 7.00 meters on August 22, 2018. That hole has led many to speculate that the Dixie project could be a company maker. The results led to a $10 million financing, of which nearly $6 million was taken down by Rob McEwen.
Great Bear has commenced a 30,000-meter drill program that will consist of approximately 150 drill holes and will continue through 2019.
The program will continue to drill test the Dixie Limb Zone (“DLZ”), including its various sub-zones such as the Hinge Zone and South Limb Zones. Step-out drilling will also test additional targets along the 10-kilometer strike length of the DLZ.
Share structure is solid with approximately 35 million shares outstanding and 46 million fully diluted. Expect some great results, expect plenty of news flow and in a rising gold market expect Great Bear to shine bright.

Here's his top pick in the cannabis sector.
Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) dedicated to the cannabis industry — which is the fastest-growing industry in the U.S.
The stocks in the cannabis industry are notoriously volatile, in part because they’re often low-priced and thinly traded, but IIPR is far less volatile, while still holding the promise of great growth.

All properties are currently leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 14.7 years.
Dividends are paid quarterly, and currently yield 2.8%. Analysts are projecting earnings of $0.76 per share in 2018 and then $1.97 per share in 2019. And the stock is currently on a normal correction, having pulled back 24% from its November high.

763,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Ultimate Software ULTI,"Ultimate Software (ULTI) — our top pick for aggressive growth — his is a pure play on the outsourcing of traditional corporate culture as redundant functions converge in the computing cloud, suggests Hilary Kramer, a leading growth stock expert and editor of GameChangers.
We’re looking at human resources as a service here. ULTI manages the entire employee relationship from recruiting through orientation all the way to retirement.
The “land and expand” expansion model should be familiar from what we know works in the cloud: start with a basic or even free service level to open an account, then sell additional functionality once customers embrace the platform.
Land the enterprise, then expand. ULTI starts with the basic accounting-driven package, giving customers a state-of-the-art payroll and benefits program.
From there, what’s truly extraordinary is the analytics tools that ultimately add up to staffing-oriented artificial intelligence. An enterprise running the full suite can track all human resources to plan ahead, reduce waste and even make long-range hiring decisions on the go.
The basic program competes with existing payroll solutions in terms of price. The advanced features are sold on a monthly per-employee subscription basis, so when you’re looking at truly large organizations the recurring revenue adds up fast.
Applebee’s is a representative customer operating at this level: 10,000 employees, complex just-in-time staffing and payroll needs, rapid growth through acquisitions. The system scales with the customer. They’re overjoyed.
ULTI is also growing fast through acquisitions of its own as it consolidates scattered standalone applications into a single platform. The goal is to offer customers everything adjacent to the traditional human resources function, starving competitors and providing ammunition for the “expand” side of the sales conversation.
Sum up all the parts and ULTI is growing extremely fast. Revenue doubled between 2013 and 2017 and is still ramping up around 20% a year for the foreseeable future. Here at a $1 billion run rate, the company is in the sweet spot of scale, with earnings gains generally tracking at or above revenue.
As long as management resists the urge to roll up competitors in 2019, we could see every $1 added to the top line turn into $0.25 in profit. I’m tentatively looking for $10 EPS here by 2021, at which point the current valuation will be a little modest relative to growth. This will be a $300 stock unless a bigger rival takes it out first.

764,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Banco Santander SAN,"My recommendation is a diversified global bank that just happens to be based in Spain, Carl Delfeld, a long-standing global investing expert who has just taken over as editor of Cabot Emerging Markets Investor.
Spain has had its banking issues with a property bubble akin to our own debacle but now that the the cleanup process is done, banks will be in better shape to provide loans and help stimulate the economy. 
This is why forward-looking markets are driving European stocks upward outperforming U.S. stocks. Another reason that Europe may very well outperform America is that the European Central Bank (ECB) has signaled that it will keep rates steady for at least 12 months. 
A conservative way to play these trends is through a proxy for an economic recovery, Europe’s largest bank,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN).
Over the last decade, this Spanish bank has struggled a bit even as it has expanded its capital base and is a global bank in growth markets similar to HSBC.
It sure seems to me quite a bargain. The stock is down 33% in the last year and is trading at only 65% of book value.
Since 2010, it has averaged a price to book value ratio of 2.4 over the past decade. The stock could more than double from here to around $8 as it returns to its historical average.

775,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",So Bad It’s Good: Markets See Silver Lining in Brexit Rejection,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story. 
Prime Minister Theresa May’s record defeat in Parliament over her Brexit divorce deal provoked a curious response from markets: Optimism.
The pound edged up on Wednesday and gilts -- a traditional safe-haven investment -- sold off even though the margin of the Prime Minister’s loss was way above the threshold many analysts feared would trigger a panic. The prospect of a no-confidence vote in May later this evening has also failed to disrupt assets amid a general assumption she will prevail.
The one soft spot was the FTSE 100 Index of shares -- which tends to fall when the currency performs well.
The key to the robust showing from U.K. assets appears to be in the scale of May’s defeat. The deadlock in Parliament is clearer than ever, and a belief is growing among many financial professionals that there’s an increasing chance of a so-called soft-Brexit or even no Brexit at all. Those are outcomes many investors would cheer.
“The chances of a no-deal Brexit are so slim now it’s not even really worth considering anymore,” said Greg Gibbs, founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital. “It looks increasingly that the resolution will be an even softer version than May’s proposal and/or a new referendum.”
That’s a view shared by a host of analysts polled by Bloomberg, who talked up the pound’s prospects in the wake of the vote. Banks including  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA are among those who expect May to survive the no-confidence vote called by the opposition.
Looking deeper into the underbelly of markets offers further evidence of a pickup in confidence among traders. The cost of insuring U.K. banks’ subordinated debt fell, while volatility on pound options has slumped.
Mayank Mishra, a global macro and FX currency strategist with Standard Chartered in Singapore, reckons the pound will be broadly supported as the market assigns a high chance the government will survive the confidence vote -- and a low prospect of a disorderly Brexit.
There’s another factor in the remarkable resilience of markets to the vote. A lot of bad news has already been priced into U.K. assets, so the bar for a nasty shock is high.
“Going into the vote there was a heavy consensus that the government would suffer an even heavier defeat,” said Christopher Jeffery at Legal & General Investment Management. Hence the “market reaction has been relatively muted,” he said.
Of course, not everyone sees the glass as half full. One undeniable outcome of the defeat of May’s deal, regardless of the confidence vote later, is further delay to the Brexit process and yet more uncertainty for traders. Dean Turner of UBS Global Wealth Management is among those recommending caution.
“U.K. assets will continue to be vulnerable to the political volatility and we don’t expect this will subside until a concrete conclusion emerges,” the economist said. “We do not advocate investors take directional views on sterling, gilts or U.K. stocks while this clarity void remains so large.”
Fidelity International Leigh Himsworth is similarly wary. He’s reminding investors that a no-deal Brexit remains the default option, and that the mechanics of any other possibilities are difficult. He recommends investing in liquid assets and hedging against the various outcomes.
The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.2858 as of 10:45 a.m. in London. The FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.4 percent, and the yield on 10-year gilts rose eight basis points to 1.334 percent.
May lost the vote on approving her Brexit deal by 432 to 202.
“This outcome is so dire for Brexit that the chances of a softer Brexit or even a second referendum may have risen,” said Stephen Jen, chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital, who estimates the currency’s fair value is between $1.50 and $1.55. The pound is “so weak and so cheap -- it is so undervalued,” he said.

The ruling opens the way for the world's largest delivery company to sue EU regulators for damages. UPS has said it is seeking 1.74 billion euros ($1.99 billion).
The EU veto paved the way for U.S. rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) to acquire TNT for 4.4 billion euros in 2016 in a deal approved by the Commission.
The Commission had rejected UPS's planned 5.2 billion euro acquisition of TNT saying UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers.
The court said the Commission had infringed UPS's rights of defense by using a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in its exchange of views and arguments with UPS.

Wednesday's ruling follows that of the General Court of the European Union, the EU's second highest court, in 2017. The Commission had appealed against that ruling.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",German carmakers warn hard Brexit would be 'fatal',"By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers on Wednesday warned of fatal consequences if Britain left the European Union without a divorce deal, predicting job losses in Britain and Europe and urging lawmakers to redouble efforts to ensure tariff-free trade can continue. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the EU suffered an overwhelming defeat in parliament on Tuesday, leaving the country's future in limbo and manufacturers bracing for their ""worst-case scenario"", a no-deal Brexit. 
Britain would suffer most if it lost free trade with European markets since 80 percent of vehicles assembled in the country are exported, mostly to the European Union. But for Germany the stakes are also high. 
In 2016, Britain was the largest single export market for German manufacturers, who sold 800,000 new cars there, or 20 percent of their overall global exports. Fewer cars are exported to China and U.S. because German carmakers have factories there.
""The consequences of a 'no deal’ would be fatal,"" German auto industry association VDA said after the vote. 
""Without an orderly and practical solution for business, jobs in the car industry, particularly on the British side, are on the line."" 
BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler, parent company of Mercedes-Benz, urged British politicians to create clarity over Brexit and ensure tariff-free trade can continue. 
""Uncertainty is not good for business... we must therefore continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent,"" BMW Group said.
""We strongly urge all relevant stakeholders to do everything possible in order to establish much needed certainty for our business and to maintain the truly frictionless trade on which our international production network is based,"" BMW said.
BMW, which builds 60 percent of its Mini vehicles at a plant in Oxford, southern England, relies heavily on components imported from BMW's German plants. It has beefed up its logistics to include air freight options. 
Tariffs are a problem for low-margin high volume automakers like Toyota, which has a factory in Derby, and Nissan with operations in Sunderland but also for Volkswagen which has no British factory and relies on imports to serve U.K. customers. 
""We took note of the results of the vote in Britain's parliament with regret,"" Volkswagen said. 
""It represents a further phase of uncertainty and hampers our ability to plan ahead. We and the entire industry need clarity about the nature of relations between Britain and the European Union. Every further delay in the Brexit decision-making process puts investment and jobs at risk,"" VW said.

Daimler said it aimed to ensure goods can continue to enter and exit the U.K. in a timely manner after Brexit.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shares lagged Europe on Wednesday after Prime Minister Theresa May's resounding defeat in a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, but in the face of unrelenting political uncertainty investors shifted their focus to results and M&A news.
A defeat had largely been priced in already, though the magnitude of the loss - a margin of 230 - came as a surprise.
Analysts and investors interpreted the outcome as a positive for the market, making a ""softer, later"" Brexit more likely, but uncertainty ahead of a no confidence vote in May's government on Wednesday evening kept trading muted.
""There's still quite a lot of uncertainty...a hard exit is a lower probability risk than it was but I don't think we can completely discount it,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office for UBS Global Wealth Management.
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.6 percent by 0930 GMT while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) held flat and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.2 percent.
The top British index was dragged down by multinational exporter stocks like  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and  Diageo  (L:DGE), which make the lion's share of their earnings in foreign currencies and are bruised by sterling rising.
Bank shares (SX7P) were the biggest boost to European indexes, up 0.9 percent as investors bet that a disruptive no-deal Brexit was less likely after the parliamentary vote.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), AXA (PA:AXAF) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) were the top three boosts to Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX), but the gains remained unconvincing with the endgame to Brexit still clear as mud.
""Unfortunately, everything remains possible: new elections, an extension of the deadline for Article 50, or even a second referendum,"" said Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at DWS.
Italian banks rallied, led by Unicredit (MI:CRDI), having slumped in the previous session on fears the European Central Bank may require full coverage of non-performing loans by 2026.
They helped Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) rise 0.5 percent, outperforming peers, after Unicredit said it considers its non-performing exposure (NPE) coverage ""fully adequate"".
The Brexit vote defeat drove UK domestic stocks up as investors grew more optimistic about the prospects for sectors seen as highly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit.
UK housebuilders  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW),  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV), and Berkeley Group (L:BKGH) were among the top European gainers, up 2.1 to 3 percent.
""If you look at domestic UK stocks, some of their valuations have been pushed back to blood-on-the-street type valuations,"" said Dominic Wallington, head of European equity at RBC Global Asset Management.
""There's real insurance in some of these valuations, that I think is remarkable.""
Overall Britain's FTSE 100 is trading at a much lower valuation than peers.
Elsewhere in Europe results and dealmaking news drove moves with stocks shrugging off the night's political developments.
Danish freight company DSV (CO:DSV) climbed 4 percent after it made a bid for Swiss logistics company Panalpina (S:PWTN) valuing the company at $4.1 billion.
Panalpina shares soared 27.7 percent after the bid which, at 170 Swiss francs per share, represents a 24 percent premium to the stock's closing price on Tuesday.
""We can see the strategic logic for DSV, as the deal would give them a large opportunity to scale their process and IT capabilities. But a deal of this magnitude will not be without risk,"" wrote Bernstein transport analyst Daniel Roeska.
 Pearson  (L:PSON) shares tumbled 5.3 percent, the biggest European fallers, after the British education publisher said it expects one-off restructuring costs to rise to around 330 million pounds, ahead of its original 300 million pound plan.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",British banks soldier on through enduring Brexit impasse,"LONDON (Reuters) - British banks swerved heavy share price losses in early trading on Wednesday, hours after a parliamentary vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal returned the most blistering defeat for a UK government in almost a century.
State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) enjoyed rises of 1.7 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, while  Barclays  (L:BARC) and HSBC (L:HSBA) saw stocks up by 0.7 percent each by 0909 GMT.
Analysts said risks of further deadlock were already priced into bank shares during the lengthy hiatus since the originally planned vote which the prime minister suspended in December.
The modest rises suggest momentum is building behind a 'Plan B' compromise, according to some investors including David Roberts, co-manager on the Liontrust Strategic Bond fund.
""Global investors now believe the chances of a 'hard' economically damaging Brexit have receded ... There is still a long way to go, but hopes of a mutually beneficial solution are growing,"" he said.
Opponents to May's deal have honed in on several elements, including the Irish ""backstop"" and fears of a so-called ""divorce bill"" that could run to 39 billion pounds ($50.2 billion).
While bank shareholders shrugged off the latest drama at Westminster, Lloyds separately announced a commitment to lend 18 billion pounds to established UK firms and start-ups during 2019 in its latest effort to shore up business sentiment.
""During these uncertain times, it is important that our customers have financial support and expert guidance to navigate the challenges they may face,"" Chief Executive Antonio Horta Osorio said in a statement.
""Whatever the future brings, we will continue to support UK businesses as part of our commitment to help Britain prosper.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's blue chip stocks were lower in early deals as the stronger pound pushed multinationals lower after Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the European Union suffered an overwhelming defeat and weak results from  Pearson  weighed.
The top share index (FTSE) was down 0.1 percent at 0848 GMT, lagging European peers as the sterling hit its highest since November, a day after British lawmakers overwhelmingly defeated May's Brexit divorce deal.
The prime minister's historic loss was seen as reducing the chance of a hard Brexit even as uncertainty ahead of a no confidence vote in May's government on Wednesday evening kept trading muted.
Consumer staples which earn their revenue abroad in foreign currency accounted for the biggest drop, with oil and gas (FTNMX0530) down 0.5 percent. Blue-chip stocks generate 70 percent of their income overseas. 
The domestically focused midcaps (FTMC), which make half of their income at home, were up 0.4 percent. Ireland's top share index (ISEQ), one of the barometers for Brexit sentiment, was up 0.5 percent. 
A hard exit is ""a lower probability risk than it was, but I don't think we can completely discount it. The market isn't completely discounting it,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office of UBS Global Wealth Management.
Housebuilders, seen to be most at risk from a weaker UK economy amid Brexit uncertainty, led the gainers after  Bovis Homes  (L:BVS) forecast better-than-expected full year profits.
 Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW), Barratt (L:BDEV) and Berkeley Group (L:BKGH) were all up between 2.2 and 2.5 percent. Midcap Bovis was up 3.6 percent.
""The potential for a softer Brexit outcome may neutralize any negative impact of higher uncertainty and the vote of no confidence,"" said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg.
In corporate moves, Pearson (L:PSON) topped the fallers after its full-year outlook. The company's forecast for full-year profits was in line with expectations, but pointed to weaker-than-expected revenues.
Liberum analysts said the guidance was possible only due to a massive savings drive.

Investors shunned  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) after it announced its chairman was retiring after more than 30 years at the firm. He is considered an architect of the company's push to become a global consumer health products company.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways has offered to pick up shares of debt-laden Jet Airways Ltd (NS:JET) at a 49 percent discount and to immediately release $35 million to bail out the troubled carrier if certain conditions are met, CNBC-TV18 reported.
Shares of Jet Airways, in which Etihad already has a 24 percent stake, fell as much as 7.5 percent to 271.75 rupees ($3.83) in their biggest intraday drop since early December, after CNBC-TV18 reported that Etihad had offered to pay 150 rupees for each share of the Indian airline.
The report cited as its source a letter from Etihad's CEO Tony Douglas to the  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), Jet's biggest lender, about a restructuring plan for the Indian carrier.
While Jet controls over a sixth of its home market, its margins, like that of other local players, have been eroded by high fuel taxes, a weak rupee and intense price competition, leaving it with about $1.14 billion in net debt as at the end of September and a pile of dues to pilots, lessors and vendors.
In fact, some lessors are even exploring the possibility of taking back aircraft, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
Jet will not be able to continue funding operations beyond the next week, the CNBC-TV18 report cited Douglas as saying in his letter. The Abu Dhabi carrier is willing to inject $35 million at once if some conditions are met, the letter adds.
The letter also warns of the imminent risk of lessors grounding aircraft, the report said.
Jet and Etihad representatives are due to meet in Mumbai with lenders, led by SBI, later in the day to discuss the proposal that involves Etihad increasing its stake, a source with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.
Jet's CEO, Vinay Dube, declined to take questions from reporters on the sidelines of an aviation conference in Mumbai, while an Etihad spokesman declined to comment.
ETIHAD'S CONDITIONS
According to CNBC-TV18, Etihad wants Jet's founder and Chairman, 69-year-old Naresh Goyal, to step down from the board and his stake to be slashed to 22 percent from 51 percent.
Goyal's penchant for control has emerged as a major obstacle as the 25-year-old airline tries to negotiate a rescue deal, Reuters reported last month, citing people who have worked with him.
Etihad is also seeking an exemption from the market regulator on preference pricing and open offer guidelines to invest more for the bailout, the report added.
Under India's capital markets regulations, Etihad is required to make an open offer to shareholders for a majority of the shares once its stake goes past 25 percent, unless it obtains a rare exemption from the market regulator.
India Ministry of Civil Aviation Secretary R N Choubey on Wednesday told reporters that the ministry had not received an official request from Jet and Etihad for an exemption.
Rival airline SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) in 2015 reportedly received a waiver from the regulator that allowed promoter Ajay Singh to rescue its finances without making an open offer.
In Jet's case, there is hope that any regulatory issue could be resolved and a rescue package be finalised within the next month, a source familiar with the matter said.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>",Nissan plans to file for damages against Ghosn: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd plans to file a civil suit against ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn to claim damages resulting from the alleged misuse of company funds, a person with knowledge of the issue said, adding to the high-profile executive's legal headaches.
Ghosn, who remains chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), has already been charged with three counts of financial misconduct and has been held at a detention centre in Tokyo for nearly two months.
On Tuesday, a Tokyo court denied his request for release on bail, raising the possibility that he may remain in custody for months before his trial begins.
Ghosn denies the charges against him, which include understating his salary for a total of eight years and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books.
""The broader investigation (into Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct) continues to expand, so we will file a suit after that issue has been sorted out,"" said the person familiar with the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
A civil suit could seek losses related to the alleged use of company funds to pay for the executive's residences, donations to universities, and payments to a Saudi businessman who sources previously said helped Ghosn out of financial difficulties.
Nissan declined to comment on the issue.
Ghosn regularly spent more than 100 days a year flying between Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama and cities including Paris, and had residences in Tokyo, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam and Beirut.
Nissan had been providing those residences to the executive, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, but people inside the company with knowledge of the issue said the company was only aware that it had been paying rent for Ghosn's apartment in Tokyo.
Reuters last month reported that payments for some of Ghosn's residences were portioned out and processed through a Nissan unit in the Netherlands called Zi-A Capital BV and its subsidiaries, which initially had been set up to invest in technology start-ups.
Nissan has confirmed that payments related to residences and other expenses such as a yacht club membership and donations to universities in Lebanon, Ghosn's ancestral homeland, had violated company procedures and its code of conduct, according to another person with knowledge of the issue.
It is also considering filing for damages related to 7 million euros ($7.98 million) in compensation paid last year to Ghosn from a Dutch unit set up by Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, that person said condition of anonymity, adding that Nissan's internal investigation has confirmed that those payments were made without the knowledge of the unit's board.
Ghosn's arrest sent shockwaves through the auto industry and rocked Nissan's alliance with Mitsubishi and Renault.
Having been credited for masterminding Nissan's financial turnaround two decades ago, the executive has since been removed from chairmanship positions at both Nissan and Mitsubishi.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Buoyed by concluding a big pay raise for steel workers last month, a United Steelworkers union top negotiator squares off on Wednesday against oil companies seeking to win a 24 percent wage hike for 30,000 refinery and chemical employees.
The stakes are high for the union and oil industry, which scored big profits last year from refining and chemicals. The talks are the first since 2015 when a stalemate led to rolling strikes that sent more than 7,000 workers off their jobs at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants.
The union's co-negotiator, USW International Vice President Tom Conway, is a 6-foot-tall former Bethlehem Steel millwright with a reputation as a bulldog, according to associates. He faces negotiators from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's U.S. arm, which has represented the oil industry in talks since 1997.
Conway led USW negotiations last year with U.S. Steel Corp that got hourly employees a 14 percent raise over four years.
The USW is seeking a three-year agreement with the oil industry that would replace the pact that expires on Feb. 1. The union's proposals include an 8 percent annual wage increase for each year of the contract. Union members with four years' experience earn about $40 an hour.
The contract covers 30,000 workers at plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC),  BP  (LON:BP) Plc,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp and Delek US Holdings Inc.
Refiners enter talks enjoying high profits from near-full plant utilization rates and record product exports that have lifted margins.
""We look forward to a productive set of talks with the USW and will bargain in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement,"" said Shell spokesman Ray Fisher.
Fisher declined to discuss the terms that the company would offer.
In addition to higher pay, the union is seeking improved job security, health and safety conditions including the number of consecutive days that employees must work, officials have said.
Conway, son of a union member and a U.S. Air Force veteran, declined to be interviewed. But in remarks at a union convention in 2017, he described his negotiating philosophy as a battle with corporations to get the benefits workers deserve.
""Collective bargaining makes them sit and share with us what we rightfully have a right to demand,"" he said at the Las Vegas meeting. ""Be ready for it, because the fights will come whether we want them or not. But when the fights do come, we can win those fights.""
Conway helped lead workers through the 2015 strike, triggered when oil-company negotiators failed to ask for an extension of talks after the prior contract expired, said former USW International Vice President Gary Beevers.
""He is an excellent negotiator and an asset to the team,"" Beevers said of Conway. Conway is part of a two-man team with USW National Oil Bargaining Chairman Kim Nibarger.
Failure to reach a deal could have widely felt impact. During the 2015 strike, the 12 refineries cut production by as much as 50 percent, reducing gasoline supply during the spring build-up during the summer driving season.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Ford and IBM among quartet in Congo cobalt blockchain project,"By Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford (N:F), technology giant  IBM  (N:IBM), South Korean cathode maker LG Chem (KS:051910) and China's Huayou Cobalt (SS:603799) have joined forces in the first blockchain project to monitor cobalt supplies from Democratic Republic of Congo.
The pilot, overseen by responsible-sourcing group RCS Global, aims to help manufacturers ensure that cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries has not been mined by children or used to fuel conflict.
Companies are under pressure from consumers and investors to prove that minerals are sourced without human rights abuses, but tracking raw materials throughout their journey is challenging. 
The project announced on Wednesday has been quietly under way since December. Starting with industrially mined cobalt in Congo, it is monitoring supplies all the way to lithium-ion batteries for Ford vehicles.
Supplies of cobalt, expected to be needed in huge quantities for electric vehicles and electronic devices, are concentrated in Congo, a sprawling, volatile nation that has been racked by civil war and political tension. 
The outcome of elections in December, which had been intended to be Congo's first democratic transfer of power in six decades, is contested. [nL8N1ZB393]
RCS says the IBM blockchain platform could be used to include other minerals and to allow artisanal miners, which analysts say are the biggest issue with regard to ethical sourcing, to join a blockchain-based network of validated participants.
Blockchain, famed as the technology behind cryptocurrency bitcoin, works by providing a shared record of data held by a network of individual computers rather than a single party. 
For the pilot project, which should be completed around the middle of the year, cobalt from Huayou's industrial mine will be placed in secure bags, entered into a blockchain and traced from the mine and smelter to LG Chem’s cathode and battery plant in South Korea and then on to a Ford plant in the United States. 
Because minerals are often combined with metals from various sources when they are smelted, they are particularly difficult to track.
The RCS project seeks to enforce best practice by using guidelines drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
IBM said it was exploring the potential of chemical analysis using artificial intelligence to pinpoint the origin of cobalt and ensure so-called clean cobalt was not smelted with minerals sourced less responsibly.
""There is no fool-proof method, but you have to keep the ball moving forward, to keep raising the level of accuracy,"" Manish Chawla, general manager of IBM's mining and industrial sector business, told Reuters.
""Blockchain has been proven to be a very effective technology in raising the bar.""
IBM has already worked with retailers including Walmart (N:WMT) and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) to trace food through supply chains. [nL4N1WK2YO] 

In the mining sector, meanwhile, Anglo American's (L:AAL) De Beers has begun using blockchain to track diamonds. [nL8N1WE4YQ]

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded near flat, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.1% by 9:33 PM ET (02:33 GMT).
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 560 billion yuan ($82.64 billion) through reverse repo operations on Tuesday, noting in a statement on its website that the injection was meant to maintain ""reasonably ample"" liquidity in the banking system.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 traded 0.1% higher.
In the U.K., the House of Commons voted 432 versus 202 against Prime Minister May’s Brexit Deal. Following the defeat, May now faces a confidence vote in Parliament later today.
“It is clear that the House does not support this deal,” May told the Commons.
“But tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support -- nothing about how -- or even if -- it intends to honor the decision the British people took in a referendum Parliament decided to hold,” she added.
The U.K. is due to leave the EU in 10 weeks. If nothing is approved by March 29, Britain would make a “no-deal” departure from the bloc, which could pose dire economic risks.
Despite the news, the British pound turned higher earlier in the day due to “strong cross-party support to prevent a no deal from occurring on 29 March,” CNBC reported citing a morning note released by ANZ Research.
The gains in the pound are ""limited by the prevailing uncertainty,” ANZ added.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed higher after China vowed tax cut on a larger scale to help support its slowing economy.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the government would help the country to meet its economic goals for 2019, while the National Development and Reform Commission said it would aim to achieve “a good start” in the first quarter.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 09:25PM ET</span>",Sears chairman's takeover proposal faces moment of truth,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Negotiations between Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert and the bankrupt U.S. department store operator approached a resolution late on Tuesday as the billionaire hedge fund manager faced the choice of improving his $5 billion offer for the company or ending his takeover plans, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
After two days of haggling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain set a Wednesday deadline to complete the bankruptcy auction for the 126-year-old retailer, the people said. Sears was weighing Lampert's offer against the sum it would recoup by winding down its business and selling its assets off in pieces.
Liquidating Sears would end the department store in its current form, meaning layoffs for as many as 68,000 people and the closure of about 500 stores.
Last week Lampert, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, made an improved $5 billion offer for Sears after the company turned away his earlier $4.4 billion bid. 
But the same issues that dogged his earlier offer were proving to be hurdles for his $5 billion proposal.
Sears believes the bid falls short of covering the bills the retailer has racked up since filing for bankruptcy protection in October, the people said. A bedrock principle of bankruptcy cases is that those expenses, known as administrative claims, must be fully repaid.
Sears is also pushing Lampert to offer more money in exchange for a legal release that would shield him from future litigation over transactions he did with the company in the past, the people added. Lampert has said the deals were proper.
Lampert's $5 billion offer had taken on another $600 million-plus in liabilities, and marked $35 million for a so-called release from litigation.
Sears declined to comment.
The bankruptcy auction for Sears began on Monday morning in Manhattan at the offices of law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, which is representing the retailer. On Tuesday, representatives for Sears and Lampert briefed Drain on the status of the auction, the people said. 
Drain pressed both Lampert and the company to continue negotiating and to end their discussions one way or the other before Tuesday comes to a close, the people said. 

Sears last week made liquidation preparations before reaching a last-minute deal with Lampert that resulted in his latest bid, leading to the auction that commenced on Monday.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Global automobile and auto parts makers which want to capitalize on electric and autonomous vehicles need to cut back investments and forge more partnerships instead, the chief executive of global parts supplier Magna International said Tuesday.
Over the next decade, vehicle and parts suppliers plan to spend $300 billion to bring electric cars to the mass market, Magna CEO Don Walker said, a huge jump from last year's industry estimate of $90 billion for the period.
""We have to reduce the amount of money everybody's pouring in, because the end consumer basically wants cheap transportation,"" he said in a speech at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit.
""Ultimately, we need to be more efficient with the capital we deploy in the industry.""
The comments came as Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday they would join forces on commercial vans and pickups and were exploring joint development of electric and self-driving technology, actions meant to save the automakers billions of dollars. [nL1N1ZF0E5] 
Big oil, telecommunications and technology companies are also making large bets on electric vehicles, investing in areas such as battery startups and charging stations. [nL1N1ZB0MY]
However, payback will not come quickly, Walker said.
The path to electric and autonomous vehicle adoption is being shaped by hard-to-predict factors, such as evolving battery chemistry, vehicle cost and performance, infrastructure and government regulation, he said.
Aurora, Ontario-based Magna, the world's third-biggest parts supplier, estimates that by 2025, all-electric vehicles will make up just 4 to 6 percent of market share, Walker said. 
Vehicles with internal combustion engines will represent 30 percent to 37 percent, while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are seen at 6 to 9 percent.
In 2030, the autonomous vehicle market is estimated at $80 billion to $95 billion in annual sales, Walker said, with just 7 percent market share seen in fully autonomous vehicles without steering wheels or pedals. Some 70 percent are expected to have either no or partial automation and 23 percent with extensive automation.
""This is a very expensive endeavor (with) lots of people working on it,"" Walker said of autonomous vehicles. ""I think we need to have more cooperation.""
Magna partnered with Lyft last March to supply the ride-hailing service with high-tech kits to turn vehicles into self-driving cars.

Last summer, it set up two joint ventures with Beijing Electric Vehicle Co, China's largest electric car maker, to engineer and build EVs in China.

(Reuters) - Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone will be leaving  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) less than a year after taking the job, the company said on Tuesday, the latest in a string of executive departures from Snap over the past year.
Shares of Snap dropped 8 percent to $6.02 in after market trading.
Stone's departure is not related to any disagreements with the company, which owns popular photo messaging app Snapchat, Snap said in a filing https:// Snap has faced high-profile troubles recently as it continues to grapple with a widely-panned redesign of the Snapchat app, which was attributed to a decline in Snapchat users over the past two quarters.  It has also struggled with high turnover in its top ranks. Former Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan and Vice President of content Nick Bell left the company in September and November, respectively.  Snap also said in the filing it expects to report fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization near the top end of its guidance.  The company previously said it expected fourth quarter revenue between $355 million to $380 million.  Stone will remain at Snap to help with the transition and the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Feb. 5, said Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel in a memo to employees on Tuesday, seen by Reuters.  
""Tim has made a big impact in his short time on our team and we are very grateful for all of his hard work,"" Spiegel said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government is moving to dismiss Renault's (PA:RENA) scandal-hit Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and has requested a board meeting to consider candidates to replace him, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
France, Renault's biggest shareholder, had until now supported the company's decision to keep Ghosn in office while he awaits trial in Japan for alleged misconduct at Nissan (T:7201), the French carmaker's alliance partner he also chaired until his dismissal in November. 
But the government, which commands a 15 percent  Renault  stake and two board seats, has asked the company to convene its nominations committee followed by a full board meeting on Jan. 20 to begin the process of appointing one or more successors to Ghosn, according to three people briefed on the process.
A spokesman for Renault and a French finance ministry official both said they had no knowledge of plans for a weekend board meeting.
Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift firing by Nissan have deepened tensions with Renault, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker.
The French move to replace Ghosn follows a decision by the Tokyo District Court earlier on Tuesday to deny the ousted chairman's request for release on bail.
Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), is likely to replace Ghosn as Renault chairman, according to two sources.
The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the Renault CEO role currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore.
Bollore is among contenders for the permanent CEO appointment. Others under consideration include senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy,  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) boss Philippe Guillemot and one other potential candidate, a source involved in the discussions said.
""Philippe Guillemot denies being a candidate for Ghosn's succession,"" said a spokesman for food services group Elior. ""It's possible that people considered him, but no more than that.""
Senard could alternatively be appointed chairman and CEO, taking over both of Ghosn's current roles, the source said. ""All these options are on the table.""
Leroy declined to comment, and attempts by Reuters to reach Senard at Michelin were unsuccessful. Headhunting firms Korn Ferry and Emeric Lepoutre & Partners, which are involved in the executive search, could not be reached after hours.
French officials had said Ghosn should be kept in office unless it became clear he would remain ""incapacitated"" for much longer, also hinting that Tuesday's court decision would be an ""important development"".
Two senior French finance ministry officials were traveling to Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Nissan stakeholders aimed at stabilizing the alliance with Renault, daily Le Figaro reported.

Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in a Monday interview he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) is raising monthly fees for its U.S. subscribers by between 13 percent and 18 percent, the video streaming pioneer's first price increase since 2017 as it spends heavily on original content and international expansion.
Prices for its popular standard plan, which allows streaming on two devices at the same time, will rise to $12.99 per month from $10.99, the company said in a statement.
Netflix shares rose 6.5 percent to close at $354.64, adding to their 30 percent rise so far this year.
The company's top-tier plan, which allows streaming on four screens in high definition, will increase to $15.99 from $13.99 per month, while the fee for its basic plan will rise to $8.99 from $7.99.
In comparison, AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Now streaming service charges $14.99 per month, while Hulu's no-advertisements plan is priced at $11.99 per month.
""It highlights that Netflix has pricing power and even after the increase it remains a very cheap entertainment alternative,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said.
Netflix has been spending billions to bolster its original content, which boasts award-winning shows such as ""The Crown,"" ""Black Mirror"" and ""Wild Wild Country"" to fend off intensifying competition from players such as Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime Video service and Hulu. The company reported it had 137 million customers at the end of September.
The price hikes are expected to fetch Netflix hundreds of millions of dollars, ahead of the launch of streaming services from AT&T and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
While aggressive spending - a planned $8 billion in 2018 - has led to a surge in subscriber growth, its debt doubled to $6.50 billion in 2017 from $3.36 billion in 2016.
The company is expected to have a debt level of $8.33 billion in 2018, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co, which owns 15,019 shares of Netflix.
Netflix is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after market close on Thursday.

""With Netflix frequently tapping the debt markets on several recent occasions, the price hike could help ease concerns with a growing deficit on free cash flow to fund a likely continued escalation in Netflix's content spending, which likely topped $13 billion in 2018,"" CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Medici Living Group said on Tuesday the family office of German real estate investor Ralph Winter has agreed to invest $300 million over three years to develop 1,300 U.S. units of Medici's Quarters brand of shared housing for young professionals.
The initiative, which Medici Living said will make Quarters one of the top U.S. shared-living operators, is the largest single investment in U.S. ""co-living,"" the Berlin-based company said in a statement.
Co-living has gained acceptance as young people who have been priced out of housing markets in major cities drive demand for tiny apartments that are grouped around shared dining areas, lounges, workspaces, laundry rooms and gyms.
Brokerage Cushman & Wakefield identified co-living, along with coworking and ""co-everything"", as its top trend to watch in commercial real estate in 2019, after U.S. recession indicators.
Corestate Capital Holding SA (DE:CCAG), a company Winter founded, agreed in December to invest 1 billion euro ($1.14 billion) to add 6,000 rooms over the next three to five years to Medici Living's European portfolio.
Quarters already operates two sites in New York and one in Chicago. With the money from Winter's 5W family office investment vehicle, Medici Living will soon announce deals in three other U.S. cities, German entrepreneur Gunther Schmidt, who founded Medici Living in 2012, told Reuters.
He did not name the cities but said Medici Living plans to expand to Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego on the West Coast; Washington, Philadelphia and Boston on the East Coast, and Austin, Texas and Denver.
Quarters previously signed 10-year leases with two five-year options but now will offer developers a way to exit their projects as many of the buyers of those assets are not familiar with shared housing, he said. 
""As co-living is rather new, for them it's an unknown to take us in as a tenant,"" said Schmidt, who co-founded feedback management company eKomi a decade ago when he was 24. 
""We broadened the pool of developers who can work with us because they're not limited by who needs an exit,"" he said.
Sites typically will have 100 to 300 rooms, while New York will be larger at 500 rooms or more, he said.

The New York City government launched ShareNYC in November, which aims to expand affordable housing and set the standard for shared living.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter profit that easily beat Wall Street forecasts, sending shares higher, as the No. 3 U.S. carrier scheduled more flights out of its hubs and won back customers after a series of public relations disasters.
Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) jumped 6 percent to $86.11 in extended trading, lifting the airline sector and investor confidence after the carrier reported a 5 percent rise in revenue per mile flown, a closely watched industry measurement.
That growth was at the top end of United's forecast and outpaced growth reported by rival Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) earlier on Tuesday.
Airline shares had fallen this month after both Delta and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) lowered estimates for fourth-quarter unit revenue, raising concerns about the industry's ability to raise fares in an uncertain global economy.
Chicago-based United attributed its revenue growth to a strategy launched last January to expand its domestic network by adding flights and more options for connections through its seven main hubs, with a particular focus on Chicago, Denver and Houston.
Adjusted earnings per share rose to $2.41 from $1.99 a year earlier, topping analysts' average forecast by 37 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For 2019, United said it expects adjusted earnings of $10.00 to $12.00 per share.
United posted fourth-quarter net income of $462 million, or $1.70 per share, compared with a profit of $579 million, or $1.98 per share, a year ago. 
The airline said it planned to boost its flight network by another 4 percent to 6 percent next year, and said it had placed orders for four Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-300ER aircraft and 24 737 MAX planes.
However, the ability of airlines to introduce new aircraft into their fleets is being hampered by a partial U.S. government shutdown, which is delaying federal certification for new airplanes to fly commercially.
Delta on Tuesday warned of a decline in revenue growth per available seat mile in the current quarter in part due to business lost to the shutdown. 
United said it expected first-quarter unit revenue growth to be between flat and up 3 percent. It did not comment on the impact of the shutdown. 

In addition to capacity adds, United reinforced customer service over the past year in an effort to rebuild an image scarred by incidents of passenger abuse and dead pets.

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. BofA and Goldman on Tap to Report
Financial sector earnings continue tomorrow before the bell, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) highlighting the reports.
For BofA, analysts are looking for a profit of 63 cents per share on revenue of about $22.4 billion.
On average, analysts expect that Goldman Sachs earned $4.42 per share on revenue of about $7.6 billion.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) managed to close higher today despite missing on the top and bottom lines as the financial sector closed higher.
2. Another Drawdown in Crude Stockpiles Seen
Crude oil bounced higher today and could be in for more gains if there’s another decline in U.S. oil inventory data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration is expected to announce tomorrow a sixth-straight weekly decline in oil inventories for the week ended Jan. 11. Analysts forecast a drop of 1.3 million barrels.
In its Short-Term Energy Outlook released on Tuesday, the EIA forecast Brent will average $61 per barrel in 2019 and $65 in 2020, versus the 2018 average of $71.
The EIA expected WTI to average $8 per barrel below Brent in the first quarter. It saw the discount narrowing to $4 by the fourth quarter through 2020.
3. Beige Book Arrives
With trillions on its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve doesn’t have to worry about a lack of funds due to the partial federal government shutdown.
The Fed will release its Beige Book assessment of economic conditions at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT).
The information will be useful for Fed Heads who parse every page. But it would take a major surprise to shake the current thinking that the Fed will remain mostly on hold this year after all the recent information from the Fed minutes and public remarks by Chairman Jay Powell.
The chances that the FOMC will keep rates steady through October increased today, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. That’s likely due to an unexpected drop in the December core producer price index, which eased inflation expectations."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as technology and internet stocks gained on Netflix Inc's (O:NFLX) plans to raise fees for U.S. subscribers and hopes of more stimulus for China's slowing economy fostered a risk-on mood among investors.
Netflix shares jumped 6.5 percent after the video streaming company said it was raising prices for its U.S. subscribers. Other internet stocks, including shares of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), also rose following the announcement.
The S&P 500 communication services index (SPLRCL), which includes Netflix and Alphabet, climbed 1.7 percent. S&P 500 technology stocks (SPLRCT) advanced 1.5 percent.
Stocks also found support from hints by Chinese officials at more stimulus in the near term, easing concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
""We've had good news today overall,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""China is helping to defuse the daily emotional roller-coaster that is tariffs, and that Netflix thinks it can raise its subscription prices is also really good.""
Wall Street's major indexes briefly pared some gains after the British parliament defeated Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit divorce deal by a wide margin. The rejection of the deal could lead to a disorderly exit from the European Union or even to a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave the EU.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq still closed near the session's highs, however. 
""No one was expecting anything great from the Brexit outcome,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""The market was able to shrug this off.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 155.75 points, or 0.65 percent, to 24,065.59, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 27.69 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,610.3 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 117.92 points, or 1.71 percent, to 7,023.83.
Earlier in the day, gains were capped by disappointing earnings reports from big U.S. banks.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, missed quarterly profit estimates due to a slump in bond trading revenue, while  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said its loan book shrank and quarterly revenue fell in all of its major businesses.
JPMorgan shares erased the early losses and ended 0.7 percent higher. Wells Fargo shares pared losses to end 1.5 percent lower.
Health insurer UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH) jumped 3.6 percent and was the top gainer on the Dow after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit. UnitedHealth shares helped boost the S&P 500 healthcare index 1.7 percent.
Analysts expect S&P 500 profits to have grown 14 percent in the fourth quarter, much lower than the 20.1 percent growth forecast in October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 17 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.96 billion shares, compared to the 8.79 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

823,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:38PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Logs Triple-Digit Gains as Tech Triggers Rally,"Investing.com – Wall Street closed higher Tuesday as tech rallied on a surge in Netflix and a rebound in JPMorgan underpinned financials.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%. The S&P 500 added 1.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.71%.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) rebounded from weakness early Tuesday following its fourth-quarter report, which missed consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines as weaker fixed income revenue hurt performance.
The bank's shares closed about 0.7% higher, rebounding from a more-than-2% intraday drop, with some suggesting the weaker fixed income revenue was largely expected following the market rout in December.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), however, struggled to claw back losses as mixed fourth-quarter earnings weighed. CEO Tim Sloan said he expected the Federal Reserve to maintain the asset cap at the bank – imposed in February as punishment for customer violations – through 2019, longer than initially had been expected. Shares were 1.6% lower.
Financials ended the day 0.8% higher.
Beyond earnings, tech drove the broader market higher, led by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) after the streaming giant hiked up subscription prices for U.S. customers to $13 from $11 a month for its benchmark service.
""We believe this action [by Netflix] has a high probability of success, further fueling the Netflix flywheel,"" RBC said.
Among other FANG stocks, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also ended the day better-than-2% higher.
Sentiment on stocks had been supported by a bullish handover from Asia overnight after China signaled more stimulus measures in the near term to support economic growth. The promise of fresh stimulus arrived just a day after an unexpected slip in China exports fueled worries over slowing global growth.
China's stimulus pledge helped ease worries that slowing growth in China, the world's second largest oil consumer, would dent global crude demand, pushing oil prices 3.2% higher, supporting a modest rise in energy names.
On the geopolitical front, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal was voted down by a hefty margin, but this was largely expected, drawing a muted reaction in US stocks.
In economic news, a pair of reports showing weaker New York manufacturing growth and a fall in wholesale inflation last month, strengthened investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will rein in rate hikes this year.
In other corporate earnings news, United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) shares surged in after-hours trading after it topped fourth quarter earnings and touted an upbeat outlook for 2019. Passenger revenue per available seat mile – a key measure of performance for airlines – also topped expectations, rising 5.8%.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Delaware judge orders Papa John's to turn over documents to founder,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge said on Tuesday Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) must turn over internal documents to the company's founder who has been seeking to reassert control over the pizza delivery chain after he resigned as chairman in July.
John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company, has been seeking the documents to try to show the company was mismanaged and to determine if he was improperly pushed out.
The founder of the third-largest pizza delivery chain resigned in July following a Forbes story that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. 
Schnatter said the comment was mischaracterized and since then he has battled the company in court.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware's Court of Chancery ordered the company's directors to turn over documents and communications, including text messages on personal devices, related to Schnatter's firing. The order covered some messages between directors and their lawyers.
Both sides said in statements they were pleased with the ruling. The company noted the judge narrowed the scope of the document requests, while Schnatter called it a vindication of his right to the information.
The ruling comes as Papa John's is working to identify potential buyers for the company, which has drawn the interest of private equity investors.
Bouchard rejected the company's argument that Schnatter did not deserve the documents because it claimed he was seeking them for his personal gain, not for the benefit of shareholders.
The judge said Schnatter's testimony during a one-day trial led credence to his concern that he was forced out before the board investigated the Forbes story. The judge also noted he had a right to investigate why the company would quickly abandon him as the long-standing face of the company, which raised questions about management and oversight.
Schnatter also sued the board in August for breaching its fiduciary duties and causing what he said was ""irreparable harm"" to the company.

In November, the company reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly comparable sales in North America, helped by new advertising aimed at moving past its split with Schnatter.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former senior managing director of a firm that advises companies on shareholder votes was convicted on Tuesday of participating in a scheme to bribe a proxy adviser's employee with sports and concert tickets to learn how its investor clients were voting. 
A federal jury in Boston found Donna Ackerly, who worked at proxy solicitation firm Georgeson LLC, guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud charges related to her role in a scheme to bribe an Institutional Shareholder Services employee in exchange for confidential voting information.
She was among five ex-employees of Computershare Ltd's (AX:CPU) Georgeson unit to face charges in a case that prosecutors say shows how a black market for secret corporate information exists for purposes other than insider trading.
An earlier trial of Ackerly and three other ex-Georgeson employees ended in a mistrial in March. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in August barred a retrial of the other three. Prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Ackerly, 61, is scheduled to be sentenced in April.
Michael Kendall, Ackerly's lawyer, said she would appeal. In his closing argument on Monday, he argued prosecutors lacked evidence showing she knowingly participated in a bribery scheme.
Proxy solicitation firms like Georgeson help publicly traded companies on matters that require shareholder approval by trying to gather information about institutional investors' holdings and how they are voting.
Such information can help proxy solicitors give companies insight into whether shareholder proposals will likely pass or fail and shape strategies to affect the outcome.
Prosecutors said that from 2007 to 2012, Georgeson employees sought an illegal edge by bribing ISS employee Brian Bennett with $14,000 worth of tickets to events like a Boston Red Sox baseball game and concerts featuring U2 and Jay-Z.
Bennett in exchange told Georgeson employee Michael Sedlak secret details about how ISS's clients were voting, which Sedlak relayed to Ackerly and three other Georgeson employees, Charles Garske, Richard Gottcent and Keith Haynes, prosecutors said.
That information concerned votes on matters involving companies including Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Archer Daniels Midland (N:ADM), prosecutors said.
They said Ackerly and Garske also arranged to have the bribes billed to clients using invoices that included false descriptions, such as ""courier services.""
Bennett and Haynes have pleaded guilty. Prosecutors are appealing Stearns's decision to dismiss charges against Sedlak, Garske and Gottcent after the first trial.

Georgeson agreed to pay $4.5 million in 2017 and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve related charges.

The recommendation comes after British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit divorce deal by a crushing margin, triggering political chaos that could lead to a disorderly exit from the EU or even to a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave.
Market volatility will not subside until a concrete conclusion to the process emerges, said Dean Turner, UK economist at the division of the bank following the vote.
""We do not advocate investors take directional views on sterling, gilts or UK stocks while this clarity void remains so large,"" he said.

""Within existing portfolios, investors would be wise to limit any UK exposure at benchmark levels.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sterling rebounded from the day's lows on Tuesday after British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May's deal on withdrawing from the European Union, and major world stock markets climbed on hopes of more stimulus for China's economy.
Sterling rallied more than a cent to stand above $1.28 after the vote. It  was last trading at $1.2871, up 0.06 percent on the day.
May's crushing loss, the first British parliamentary defeat of a treaty since 1864, marks the collapse of her two-year strategy of forging an amicable divorce maintaining close ties to the EU after the March 29 exit.
""After the big defeat, which was even larger than what the market had expected, we might getting closer to a no-Brexit scenario. The pound has retraced some of its losses after that vote which was not unexpected. It may also simply be short-covering,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global income group at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance in Boston.
""There is still a massive amount of uncertainty for U.K. assets,"" he said.
On Wall Street, stocks rose further after initially paring gains on the Brexit vote. 
Helping stock sentiment, U.S. President Trump talked up chances of a China trade deal and Chinese officials hinted at more stimulus for their slowing economy.
Data on Monday showed China's exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply.
""Any move to stabilize the global economy by the Chinese should be viewed positively by the U.S. as well,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.

(Reuters) - U.S. discount retailer Payless ShoeSource Inc has hired an adviser to help evaluate strategic alternatives, including a sale or restructuring, less than 18 months after it emerged from bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The action underscores the efforts Payless is making to avoid a second bankruptcy, as the popularity of online shopping on websites such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) continues to challenge the viability of many brick-and-mortar retailers.
Payless has hired investment bank PJ Solomon, the sources said. The chain, a fixture in malls and strip malls known for its shoes costing less than $30, is also considering shuttering at least one-third of its approximately 3,000 stores, one of the sources added. 
The retailer may also consider filing for bankruptcy, the sources said, cautioning that no decisions on the company's future have been made. Payless exited bankruptcy in 2017 with about $400 million in loans, after slashing its debt pile from over $800 million, according to court papers. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives for Payless and PJ Solomon did not respond to a request for comment.
Payless is not the first retailer to face bankruptcy for the second time in almost as many years. Reuters reported late last year that kids clothing store Gymboree Group Inc was also considering filing bankruptcy again, one year after exiting court protection from creditors.
Payless bucked a trend because it managed to successfully emerge from its 2017 bankruptcy, while many others had to liquidate. As part of the bankruptcy, a group of creditors, including hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC, took over ownership, according to bankruptcy court records. 
The chain exited bankruptcy with a plan to focus mainly on bricks-and-mortar sales, with an emphasis on Latin America and Asia, Reuters reported at the time. 

It aimed to open four mega stores in the United States and invest $234 million over five years in systems improving its management of inventory, Reuters reported.

FAMBRAS Halal estimates sales of Brazilian halal food, including chicken, beef, honey and cheese, rose to almost $5 billion in the period despite the industry's multiple woes, it said in a statement.
""We failed to grow more as we had a very complicated year,"" Ali Hussein El Zoghbi, vice-president at the certification company, said in the statement. 
Zoghbi cited the truckers' strike last May that disrupted supplies and exports as well as a sprawling investigation into collusion to avoid safety checks in the food sector, which damaged the reputations of several major meat packers and led to trade bans.
""These elements hampered chicken and beef production, the major items responsible for the sector's high revenue,"" he said. 
Brazil is by far the world's largest exporter of halal meat, which complies with Muslim dietary rules. 
But a tentative proposal by Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro to relocate the country's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem could jeopardize that position.
Rubens Hannun, president of the Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce, said relocating the embassy could create ""noise"" in Brazil's commercial relationship with Arab nations and open the door for the competition.
According to the chamber, Brazil's total exports to a grouping of 22 Arab countries, which excludes non-Arab Muslim countries such as Iran, to swell to $20 billion by 2022, up from $13.5 billion in 2017.

Nearly all of the company's $18 billion in debt was trading down, while the share price has fallen 21.7 percent. In a form filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, PG&E announced its intention to not make the payment.

PG&E, which owns the biggest U.S. power utility by customers, said on Monday it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 as soon as this month as it faces a potential $30 billion in liabilities linked to California's catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Its shares and bonds have been falling since.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government, dealing with fuel shortages stemming from a crackdown on theft, is expected to postpone a new rule requiring pumping stations to sell cleaner diesel, according to sources with knowledge of the decision and documents from the regulator. 
This marks the first delay of a 2016 regulation that had been expected to go into effect at the end of 2018.
It has lost traction mainly due to lack of infrastructure, but also because of fears that it would exacerbate fuel shortages that emerged following President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's orders to shut key fuel pipelines to combat rampant theft, according to two of the sources. 
Lopez Obrador's crackdown has led to long lines at stations as deliveries are largely being made by truck rather than through pipelines. Fuel theft is endemic in Mexico, but businesses and consumers are growing concerned that the move is starting to harm the economy.
Mexico's new rule will require ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD, to be sold in the coming months. But at least two of state-run Pemex's refineries have not been updated to produce diesel with less sulfur content, so the country is expected to rely almost completely on imports from the United States.
Mexico last year used 390,000 barrels per day (bpd) of diesel, 28 percent of total fuel consumption, mostly imported from the United States, according to the Energy ministry.
Mexico's Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) on Dec. 28 suspended implementation of the ULSD rule to allow six more months to ensure adequate supply of ULSD in portions of nine states in the country's western and central regions, where diesel consumption is heavy. 
The rest of the country will be required to start ULSD sales by March 31 after producers, transporters and distributors start switching to the new fuel in the coming weeks, according to the resolution. 
But the rule has not yet been made official, creating doubts on the date it will take effect. A source at the regulator said plans call for it to be published in the coming days.
The CRE document said ""the Tula and Salamanca refineries do not have capacity for producing ULSD, and infrastructure for transportation and storage is limited."" 
Mexico currently allows up to 500 parts per million of sulfur in motor diesel. The new rule would cut that to 15 parts per million, similar to standards in the United States, which reduces overall carbon emissions. 
Shippers worldwide are gearing up for similar changes to begin in 2020 that would limit the kind of fuel tankers can operate on to low-sulfur fuels.
Mexico's refineries have suffered from underinvestment and poor maintenance in recent years. Pemex's diesel production has dropped to 118,000 bpd in 2018 from 313,400 bpd in 2013, according to company data. 
Traders that were preparing for growing ULSD imports from the United States, the continent's largest producer of distillates, are now waiting for the document to be released to better plan purchase volumes, two sources said.
No ULSD imports entered through Mexico's major oil ports in early January, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Last year through October, the United States sent about 294,000 bpd of low-sulfur distillate fuels to Mexico, according to U.S. Energy Department data. 
""Pemex does not have capacity to produce the ULSD the country would demand, and it also lacks capacity to import all the volume that will be consumed once the new rule starts,"" one of the traders said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top-performing U.S. growth fund managers of the last year are taking the recent slide in the U.S. stock market to add to their bets in companies they expect will continue to expand regardless of the direction of the overall economy. 
Among their top bets: life science companies like Biogen Inc (O:BIIB), laboratory supply company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (N:TMO), and Canadian cannabis company  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY). 
The bullishness comes at a time when U.S. stock investors must weigh a strong domestic economy against the threats to growth posed by rising interest rates and a global economic slowdown exacerbated by higher trade tariffs between the United States and China, the world's largest economies. 
The S&P 500 tumbled in the fourth quarter, edging close to the 20 percent decline from its high that would signify a bear market. Since hitting a low on Christmas Eve, the broad market is up nearly 11 percent. 
""In a nutshell, we think very little has changed,"" said Tom Slater, a portfolio manager of the $11.2 million Baillie Gifford U.S. Equity Growth fund, which has beaten the benchmark S&P 500 by 13.3 percentage points over the last 12 months. ""There's a lot of doom and gloom in financial markets but we see fairly little evidence that doom and gloom is merited.""
As a result, Slater is sticking with companies like food delivery service GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB) and e-commerce platform company Shopify Inc (TO:SHOP) that are innovating new business models or opening up old industries through innovation. 
""We're not massively interested in investing in technology but in new business models,"" Slater said.
Anthony Zackery, a portfolio manager of the $127.6 million Virtus Zevenbergen Innovative Growth fund, said that his fund is eschewing some of the larger tech giants like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) that have led the broad market higher over the last few years and instead has been adding to its stake in tech companies such as identity management software company  Okta Inc  (O:OKTA). Shares of the company are already up 12.7 percent since the start of January, adding to an approximately 160 percent rally over the last 12 months. 
""We believe that the stock could double over the next three to four years if they continue executing,"" Zackery said. 
Along with Okta, Zackery is also bullish on Canadian cannabis company Tilray Inc, whose shares he bought during its initial public offering, because of its business lines focused on both the recreational and medical marijuana market. 
""We believe that we are in the early innings of the end of global prohibition (of marijuana),"" he said. 
Christopher Smith, portfolio manager of the $249 million Artisan Thematic Investor fund, said that he is focusing on life science companies because their products are not subject to tariffs at a time of increasing spending on healthcare in emerging markets like China. 
""It's somewhat immune to the uncertainty,"" he said. 
He has been adding to his position in companies such as Thermo Fisher, Danaher Corp (N:DHR), and PerkinElmer Inc (N:PKI) because they operate in segments with high barriers to entry and have the ability to raise prices. At the same time, he is avoiding all of the so-called FANG stocks - a moniker given to the group of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - that led the market early last year. 
""They just became over-owned and they're resetting now,"" he said. Instead, he is focusing on companies that ""have the ability to monetize data"" such as IHS  Markit Ltd  (O:INFO), Fidelity National Information Services Inc (N:FIS), and Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), he said.
Michael Lippert, portfolio manager of the $372.3 million Baron Opportunity fund, said that the recent rally in the S&P 500 can be pinned on the fact that ""the market got the call wrong on the Fed,"" and recalibrated after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that the central bank could be ""patient"" dialed back market expectations for rate hikes this year.
The deep declines in December allowed him to add companies to his portfolio such as life sciences software company Veeva Systems Inc (N:VEEV) that had long been on his watch list, he said. He began buying shares in the company when it traded around $84 a share in late December. It now trades at slightly over $100 a share, giving him a 19 percent gain in slightly more than two weeks. 

""I wish I hadn't been cute and bought more,"" he said.

In the recent equity sell-off, U.S. Treasuries are back with a vengeance, and bringing with them the decisive return of a relationship investors have counted on for decades: When stocks go down, bonds tend to go up and vice-versa.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). says it’s once again a good idea to have Treasuries in a portfolio, while the likes of HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management also tout fixed-income as a shelter from stormy stocks, whose volatility last month jumped to a 10-month high.
The inverse correlation between stocks and bonds has underpinned the favorite and most simple diversification strategy of fund managers across the globe -- until last year when both markets fell together in 2018, a two-decade rarity.
“We think the negative correlation is here for now,” said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, which oversees about $500 billion in assets. “While the relationship can change on any given day or over any given week, until we get closer to the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle, we think the relationship is one that will continue to play out.”
Different Sell-Off
Tighter monetary policy, U.S. government borrowing in over-drive and inflationary fears lifted yields last year, raising the specter of a regime shift unkind to the traditional equity-bond dynamic.
Treasuries are proving their muster once more as fundamentals crater, with the latest rout in stocks driven by fears of a global slowdown that’s prompted traders to scale back expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes, a buy signal for Treasuries.
That’s a far cry from sell-offs in the second half of last year, where interest-rate fears weighed on both stocks and bonds, according to Willem Sels, chief market strategist at HSBC Private Bank.
“The return of negative correlations is good news, as diversification was hard to achieve in 2018,” said Sels, who’s gravitating toward havens and hedges. He’s overweight gold, likes quality stocks and is sticking to shorter-term bonds that are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.
Responding to Fears
Thushka Maharaj, a global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says the late-cycle dynamic -- monetary tightening in response to inflationary pressures -- tends to challenge the vanilla bond-equity link. But it ultimately proves self-stabilizing thanks to policy redress.
Indeed, following the December plunge in U.S. stocks, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said central-bank policy is flexible and officials are “listening carefully” to financial markets.
“In the current inflation-targeting regime where central banks are credible, we find it hard to see prolonged periods where inflationary concerns make returns in both stocks and bonds negative at the same time,” Maharaj said by email. “A key view we hold is that bonds act as a diversifier in the event of negative growth shocks and the negative stock-bond correlations will reassert in growth slowdown scares or recession fears.""
Foolproof No More
In a low-return world, there are plenty of reasons to fret the fortunes of traditional 60/40 portfolios -- but the prospect of bonds losing their hedging firepower could prove the last straw.
With stocks forecast to post paltry gains and bonds expected to generate not much more than their coupons this year, Christophe Donay at Banque Pictet & Cie SA has turned to other hunting grounds -- namely real-estate and private equity.
“This is the first time in my career that I have seen such a breakdown of correlations between bonds and stocks,” said Donay, the head of asset allocation and macroeconomic research at Pictet, whose career has spanned three decades. “We decided to diversify to illiquid assets because of the poor returns in bonds and stocks.”
So-called “endowment style” investing -- designating one-third each to stocks and bonds, and another third to illiquid assets -- is supplanting 60/40 in many of his funds, he said.
Wells Fargo’s Jacobsen remains a believer in diversification. A balanced portfolio may have lost money last year, but less than if investors had put everything into equities.
After suffering its worst year in a decade, DFA’s Global Allocation 60/40 Portfolio is bouncing back and reversed course in late December.
“Diversification just changes the trade-offs investors face,” Jacobsen said. “In hindsight, those trade-offs could be like trading a slap in the face for a punch in the gut.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Three former  Barclays  (L:BARC) bankers cheated the global financial system to gain an unfair edge over counterparties in a five-year plot to rig Euribor interest rates, a London prosecutor alleged on Tuesday.
James Waddington, a lawyer for the UK Serious Fraud Office, said the defendants were part of an elite, well-paid group that fixed the odds in a zero-sum game as he opened the prosecution's case in a criminal trial expected to last at least two months.
Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old Briton, Carlo Palombo, a 39-year-old Anglo-Italian, and 41-year-old Sisse Bohart, a Dane, deny wrongdoing. 
In London's sixth rate-rigging trial, the three defendants are accused of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of global financial contracts and loans, between 2005 and 2009.
Waddington said that two other bankers, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef and Christian Bittar, a one-time  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) trader, already stood convicted.
""The issue is whether one or more of these defendants ... was also a party to that conspiracy,"" he told the 12-person jury at London's Southwark Crown Court.
Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over differing periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.
Waddington alleged that the three defendants tilted the odds in their favor for profit, tweaked rates to gain a dishonest trading advantage and thought they would not be caught out.
Some of the world's most powerful financial institutions have paid around $9 billion to settle allegations that bankers submitted rates that flattered their own trading books.
Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 following allegations of rate-rigging. 

The British bank paid a $453 million penalty, sparking a backlash that forced out former chief executive Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) Chief Executive Mike Manley told Reuters on Tuesday he is open to partnerships to develop a new midsize pickup truck the automaker could sell in Latin America and other markets outside the United States to compete with models such as Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Thailand-built Ranger.
""A gaping hole in our portfolio is a metric ton pickup"" that would be a lower-cost, lower-priced vehicle aimed at work and commercial uses in markets outside the United States, Manley said in an interview at the Detroit auto show.
""Do you fill that individually or fill that in partnership? We are looking at what can we do individually, and if we partner with someone what would that look like?""
Rivals Ford and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) on Tuesday said they plan to jointly develop replacements for their respective midsize trucks as part of a new commercial vehicle alliance. VW and Ford compete with Fiat Chrysler for pickup sales in a variety of markets, including the United States and Brazil.
FCA last year outlined plans to launch such a pickup - smaller than its current Ram 1500 model - by 2022. Manley drew a distinction between the Jeep Gladiator midsize pickup that Fiat Chrysler unveiled in Los Angeles last November, and the ""metric ton"" pickup sold in developing markets. The Gladiator is a ""lifestyle truck,"" he said, that is not designed to compete at the lower price levels typical of work-oriented pickups. 
""The Gladiator is perfect for the U.S. market,"" Manley said. ""But because of its content it's not perfect for Thailand.""

Ford builds a version of its Ranger truck in Thailand, but heavily modified that vehicle to adapt it to the U.S. market. Rivals such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) also sell different versions of midsize pickups in the United States than they offer in less wealthy markets.

857,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 01:18PM ET</span>","As loans and revenue shrink, Wells Fargo leans on cost cuts","By Imani Moise and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's loan book shrank and revenue fell across all its major businesses last quarter, as the fourth-largest U.S. lender continued to work through the consequences of wayward sales practices at its consumer bank.
Wells Fargo has struggled to regain its footing since sales abuses came to light in that business more than two years ago, when the bank said employees had opened millions of fake accounts in customers' names without their permission.
Management has since centralized risk controls, overhauled employee compensation and pushed a renewed focus on customer wellness to address underlying problems.
Some of those changes are hurting revenue, executives acknowledged on Tuesday when discussing fourth-quarter results. For instance, the bank now sends customers real-time low balance alerts to protect them from overdraft fees.
Wells Fargo is also experiencing cyclical pressure in mortgage lending, which was once its main money-maker, and has intentionally pulled back from some areas, like auto lending, where executives felt profit potential was limited.
Combined with legal and regulatory penalties for its sales abuses, which also involved overcharging hundreds of thousands of customers on auto loans, mortgages and account features they did not request, the bank has struggled to get its profit engine humming again.
In lieu of revenue growth, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has laid out an aggressive cost-cutting plan to buoy profits.
The bank's shares were down 1.9 percent to $47.52 in midday trading.
ASSET CAP
Sloan said on Tuesday he expects the Federal Reserve to maintain an asset cap on the bank through the remainder of the year.
The Fed imposed that penalty in February as punishment for the sales abuses, saying it would only be lifted once the bank proved it had fixed what was wrong.
Wells Fargo executives initially said the cap would not hinder the bank's business growth, and as recently as July predicted it would be lifted by mid-2019.
But progress has been slower than expected, Sloan said on a call with analysts, who peppered him with questions about the profit impact of the asset cap.
""It is hard not to feel like the regulatory penalty box is endless,"" said Brian Foran, an analyst with Autonomous Research.
The bank has already paid billions in combined fines and settlements with regulators and private litigants over its sales abuses, and remains on a tight leash with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as it continues remediation efforts.
Wells Fargo also faces probes from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During the fourth quarter, the bank's loan book shrank 1 percent and deposits fell 3 percent. Consumer loans posted the biggest decline, hurt primarily by more people paying off their mortgages than taking out new ones. Mortgage banking revenue fell by half.
Wells Fargo's overall quarterly profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, was down 1 percent from the $5.74 billion, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. 
Those results reflected special items including some $432 million in operating losses from legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation, and a $614 million gain on the sale of troubled mortgage loans that predate the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Revenue fell 5 percent to $20.98 billion, below Wall Street's $21.73 billion estimate.
Wells Fargo met Sloan's expense target last year when excluding big one-time items like legal costs, regulatory penalties and customer remediation expenses.
The bank is now aiming to slash expenses to a range of $52 billion to $53 billion this year, and $50 billion to $51 billion by 2020. Wells Fargo is on track to hit those goals through efficiency programs that will reduce overall headcount by 5 percent to 10 percent, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said.

Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and a slump in bond trading revenue.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) generated $1.98 a share in profit on revenue of $26.8 billion, missing expectations for $2.20 a share in profit on revenue of $26.9 billion. Its shares recovered from a 2% drop earlier to trade more than 1% higher.
The first profit miss for the bank in nearly four years was attributed to weaker-than-expected revenue from bond trading and rising costs from loan-loss reserves weighed down performance.
Still, the results did little to deter investors, some of whom had already priced in the bad news following the market rout in December, according to Briefing.com.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reporting earnings that beat expectations, but revenue fell short as the scandal-hit bank grappled with sanctions imposed last year and mounting legal costs to resolve complaints over alleged customer violations. Its shares fell 1%.
Wells Fargo generated $1.21 a share in profit, beating expectations of $1.19, but revenue of $21 billion fell short of estimates for $21.75 billion.
Growth in its primary consumer checking accounts, which CEO Tim Sloan cited as a key measure for consumers' attitude towards the bank, slowed in the fourth quarter to 1.2%, from 1.7% in the third quarter.
The duo of reports arrived a day of ahead of reports from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
The weakness in fixed-income trading revenue is expected feature more prominently in Bank of American's report as the Wall Street bank boasts a large exposure to fixed income trading, though some said this could be offset by growth in its mortgage and credit segments.

China faces growth issues as the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) easing is not enough to support the economy and the government’s fiscal plans aren’t enough to help either. Though the rally back in risk today extends Beijing the courtesy of a bounce but with plenty of confusing signals.
ECB Draghi faces the grim reality that negative rates and rolling over the bonds bought is insufficient to support the flagging economy and fight disinflation from lower oil prices. German GDP for 2018 was sharply lower than the previous five years even with better trade and a weaker euro to support it. If the problems in Europe’s strongest economy continue in 2019 its going to be harder for ECB action given the Draghi exit and plans for normalization.
The pound GBP/USD seems stuck in a bigger 1.26-1.31 range for the short-term and that maybe the foreshadowing for equities as the bounce up over the last two weeks seems not enough to break out for a larger rally. 
Is the China effort to spur growth sufficient?
Beijing intends to improve credit availability for smaller companies, accelerate infrastructure investment and cut taxes. Under the plan, Beijing will cut value-added tax rates for some companies, including in manufacturing, and hand tax rebates to others. China also plans to step up fiscal expenditure this year, in what looks like a Keynesian push to help companies. Xu Hongcai, Assistant Minister of Finance, told reporters in Beijing that the government was determined to ease the burden on small enterprises and the manufacturing industry, adding: “The focus is on enhancement and efficiency.”
China’s central bank has promised to make monetary policy more forward-looking, flexible and targeted.
The issue for China is not about stimulus but about debt (see chart below). It is true that China’s external debt, public and private, is still very low by world standards, reaching only 13% of GDP. But debt issued overseas has grown significantly since the slowdown of China’s credit boom. As central authorities have attempted to regulate credit, enterprises have borrowed abroad. The movement in debt in China has been led by companies that can sell the assets to cover loans but only when the markets are bid. This is the key for financial stability and for confidence to hold. There is a socialization of debt in Asia that isn’t well understood in the West where failure isn’t a cause for family shame but an incentive for better ideas. The risk/reward for 2019 rests on the believability of the China stimulus."

Oil prices are weighing signs of slowing growth in Germany versus the impact of more stimulus in China, against a backdrop of the United States finally not allowing waivers to buyers of Iranian oil and signs that U.S. oil supplies will fall.
Yesterday, the market questioned whether China was doing enough to stimulate its economy after bad trade data. Today they decided they were not doing enough. After lowering the reserve requirement for Chinese banks last week and move to tax cuts instead of infrastructure spending for the sake of infrastructure spending, China announced tax cuts that seem to put global markets and oil back into a risk on mood.
The Guardian reported that China’s finance ministry has pledged to slash taxes, to reduce the burden on small firms, as part of a new stimulus drive. Under the plan, Beijing will cut value-added tax rates for some companies, including in manufacturing, and hand tax rebates to others. China also plans to step up fiscal expenditures this year, in what looks like a Keynesian push to help companies. Xu Thongchai, Assistant Minister of Finance, told reporters in Beijing that the government was determined to ease the burden on small enterprises and the manufacturing industry, adding: The focus is on enhancement and efficiency. Then in a coordinated move to reassure markets, China’s central bank has promised to make monetary policy more forward-looking, flexible and targeted.
The reason for China’s slowing, of course, is in large part due to the trade war. President Trump, on Monday, said that China is feeling the pain from U.S. tariffs, boding well for a trade deal, but talks so far between the two nations haven’t yielded concrete results, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Yet for oil we know that there is trade progress as China has restarted imports of U.S. oil supply. Reuters reports that “Three cargoes of U.S. crude are heading to China from the U.S. Gulf Coast, trade sources said on Monday, the first departures since late September and a 90-day pause in the two countries’ trade war that began last month.”
U.S. says no to waivers for buyers of Iranian oil
Bloomberg News reports that the United States plans to grant no new waivers to buyers of Iranian oil as it intensifies efforts to eliminate the Middle Eastern producer’s exports of crude, a senior official said. U.S. sanctions have so far cut Iran’s exports to about 1 million barrels a day from a level of 2.7 million before Washington announced sanctions on the country. Of the eight buyers that secured initial U.S. waivers to buy oil from Iran, only five are still doing so, Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, said in an interview. “We are not looking to grant any new waivers -- that’s been our policy from the beginning,” Hook said. “We’ve been able to achieve a lot of economic pressure on Iran; 80% of their revenues come from oil exports. We want to deny the Iranian regime the revenue that it uses to destabilize the Middle East.”
Yet is that a problem if the global economy falters and oil demand dips? Despite all this bullish news, worries about the strength of the global economy linger. The trade war slowed Germany’s gross domestic product (GDP) to 1.5% in 2018, compared with 2.2% in 2017, the slowest in five years. Domestically the economy seemed strong, but trade weighed on the data.
The Wall Street Journal also reported that the Mexican government said Monday it is importing more gasoline to stem a growing fuel shortage that has angered motorists in much of the country. The fuel crisis was sparked by the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, shutting down several pipelines in a bid to contain rampant fuel theft, which it estimates cost state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) $3 billion last year. Criminal gangs often tap into the pipelines to steal the fuel. The government is trying to make up for the closed pipelines by having gasoline distributed by truck. But the system has created disruption across much of the country, causing long lines for fuel in many cities and hurting commerce, business leaders say. The distribution bottleneck left Mexico’s limited gasoline storage facilities full and delayed seaborne vessels waiting to unload fuel at Mexican ports.
The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Mexican gasoline imports from the United States were down sharply in the six weeks since Obrador took office on Dec. 1. I bet that will change. U.S. exports should grow even as bottlenecks slow things down. Domestic demand in the United States is solid and cheap U.S. oil prices continue to make U.S. oil attractive to foreign buyers. While crude oil may experience some volatility in the short term, we feel that in the big picture the lows are in. Hedgers of gas and diesel should use price breaks to lock things in.
Natural gas is pulling back after yesterday’s incredible run. It may have been too much too soon as the predictions of much colder weather still must develop. If the cold hits, you have not seen anything yet. If it does not, then get ready for a crash.

Aussie (ADH)
Session close: Settled at .7206, up 8 ticks
Fundamentals: Given the China Trade Balance headlines, this was a good session for the Aussie. The currency is up 2.2% in January and the Chinese yuan has gained 1.6% against the Aussie over the same period; this is not a coincidence. The Australian data has not particularly been something to write home about over this time with the trade balance coming in soft and Building Approvals the appearance of a horror flick (-9.1% versus -0.3% expected) last week. However, retail sales did beat. While we do believe that risk-sentiment in equity markets have reached a near-term exhaustion, the Chinese yuan has more to gain. This should be favorable for the Aussie, but traders should trek cautiously in the near-term after such a run.
Canadian dollar (CDH)
Session close: Settled at .75485, up 1.5 ticks
Fundamentals: Overall risk-sentiment on the heels of Chinese data and a weaker energy complex weighed on the loonie today. The currency has had a heck of a recovery through the first two weeks of the year and taking a breather for 48 trading hours is almost expected. Traders should tread cautiously. With nothing from Canada on the calendar tomorrow, U.S data and Fed speak will be the focal point."
864,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>","Crude COT Signal Closed Out a Winner, Cattle was Over Done","Due to the government shutdown, the CFTC did not produce a new COT report for the week so Andy Waldock, founder of Commodity & Derivative Advisors, takes a look at last week’s signals.
Due to the partial government shutdown, the Commitments of Traders (COT) report was not released. Since we have no new data with which to work, we’ll detail last week’s calls and the interplay between the daily and weekly COT signals.
We set up our daily and weekly COT signal charts with the same indicators and parameter values. The primary difference between the two is the absolute risk, in dollar terms. Both methods use the most recent extreme price as the stop-loss point. The monetary difference boils down to the bigger range of the weekly bars. Finally, as with any trading method, waiting for confirmation may increase the odds of success, but it comes at the expense of more substantial initial risk. This makes the daily signals, while not quite as accurate across the spectrum, more accessible to the retail trader due to the smaller risk per trade.
From here, we trade the daily and weekly data the same as any other multi-timeframe analysis. Therefore, when we get the daily and weekly to line up with each other, we may feel more certain about a given market’s turn while maintaining a reasonable risk profile.
Last week, we looked at the crude oil (CLV) and live cattle LCV) . We'll start with crude oil, which published a daily COT buy signal for Dec. 27. The weekly signal didn’t fire until trading began Sunday Jan. 6. Both the daily and weekly COT signals’ long recommendations came with the same protective sell stop to be placed at the swing low of $42.36 in the February contract. The swing low created an initial risk in the daily signals from $46.58 down to $42.36.
Meanwhile, the weekly signal would’ve entered on the open Jan. 11 at $48.30. Based on the generally expected holding period of the daily signal, we would have taken profits just as the weekly signal kicked in. The recent action in the crude oil market would constitute a winning trade for this mean reversion methodology.
Finally, last week’s live cattle recommendation took the loss on the daily and weekly trades last Friday when the February contract breached the previous week’s high at $124.95. The weekly entry was $121.80 on last Monday’s open while the daily COT signal entered at $123.65 on Jan. 3. The mid-week decline provided a brief opportunity to take profits at the daily level before the reversal higher.
As with any method, a large portion of its success comes down to managing risk. The inaugural week closed in the black with one loss and one win. We’ll return to making new predictions, prefaced by “Overbought/Oversold” and triggered by, “Reversal (+/-)” once we have new data.
Chart explainer: Table shows net commercial position, recent movement, positive/negative momentum and whether the data shows a market is overbought, oversold or anticipates a reversal."

Airbnb's expected listing in 2019 would be among a string of public debuts by highly valued Silicon Valley companies, including ride-hailing company  Uber Technologies Inc  (UBER.UL), rival Lyft Inc and workplace messaging firm Slack.
Uber and Lyft remain unprofitable. 
San Francisco, California-based Airbnb, valued by private investors at $31 billion, has in recent months turned to new services and offerings to fuel growth by adding luxury vacation homes and hotels to its platform.
Without revealing other numbers such as revenue and profit, the company said it was profitable before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). 
Airbnb also said it expects over 500 million guest arrivals at its listings by the end of the first quarter of 2019, since it was founded in 2008.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's power system operator has requested that 662 transformers made by  General Electric  Co (N:GE) be removed from the country's grid after a number of explosions involving the devices, according to document seen by Reuters. 
The document, which was prepared by Brazil's grid operator ONS and submitted to the Ministry of Mines and Energy in early December, says 53 GE transformers have exploded in the past six years, suggesting that the incidents may be associated with the product or its materials. They are all the same transformer model. 
There is no evidence that anyone was injured in those explosions.
ONS confirmed in a statement that it had made the request to change some GE transformers after finding they ""present a failure rate that is superior to what is expected for that equipment."" It did not specify the number of transformers or incidents that led to the request.
GE said it was aware of the incidents but that it had not seen the ONS report.""Currently, there is no evidence that the cause could be related to the design, the materials or the product's manufacturing,"" GE said in a statement, after Reuters provided it with excerpts of the report. The company said the transformers were used around the world. 
GE pointed to the concentration of incidents in ""one part of Brazil's electric network."" 
The problem has been on ONS's radar since 2014 and it concluded that similar incidents had not been recorded with other transformer manufacturers or different GE models, according to the document, which Reuters obtained through Brazil's access to public information law. 
A source at a local utility, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said that the position of his employer and its peers is that ""there is a systemic problem with the manufacturer, and not with the operators."" 
The source said the company had taken measures to avoid potential harm from the explosions. 
ONS's recommendation comes as GE tries to restructure its struggling power division amid falling revenues and it follows reports of problems with other products, including gas turbines in several countries.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Jana liquidates two hedge funds, to focus only on activism","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC, founded by Barry Rosenstein, is shutting down two stock-picking hedge funds following losses and will focus instead on its main strategy of investing in a handful of companies and pushing management to improve their performance. 
The New York-based firm, which managed $11 billion at its peak in 2015, will liquidate its Jana Partners and Jana Nirvana funds, the firm told its investors in a letter seen by Reuters.
Instead it will focus solely on its Jana Strategic Investment (JSI) fund, which manages $1.5 billion, and will also launch its Jana Impact Capital fund later this year, which will focus more on social activism. 
""We will transform into a firm solely dedicated to our core competency of shareholder engagement,"" Rosenstein and his team said in the letter. 
Investors in the funds that are being liquidated will be offered the chance to switch into the firm's activist funds. 
""This is where we have delivered our best returns for investors, developed a real competitive advantage, made our mark on numerous industries, and where we see our future and the richest opportunity set,"" the letter said.
Since its founding in 2001, Jana Partners has cemented its reputation as one of the industry's so-called ""celebrity activists"" along with firms run by Carl Icahn, Daniel Loeb, William Ackman and Jeffrey Smith who are able to move stock prices by simply buying stock in a corporation. 
It won board seats at Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) and ConAgra Brands Inc and criticized Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for the way it did business, helping push the grocer to sell itself to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Jana also persuaded chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc to cut costs and overhaul its compensation structure and last year it helped guide Pinnacle Foods towards a sale to ConAgra, walking away with an estimated $144 million profit.
Jana also managed two regular hedge funds that bet a company's stock would rise or fall without Rosenstein and his team actively engaging with management. Internally they were called the ""broader passive investment strategy.""
While those funds wowed investors with double-digit, market beating returns at the start of their life in 2001, recent returns have been disappointing. Last year Jana Partners fell roughly 8 percent while the market was off about 4.4 percent. And the fund has lagged the broader stock market every year since 2013.
INDUSTRY-WIDE LOSSES 
Jana's decision to streamline its operations comes as hedge fund investors are losing patience with years of lackluster industry returns. Last year was especially bad, with the average stock-oriented hedge fund falling 7 percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
Investors have told fund managers they want unique strategies that cannot be copied instead of standard long-short equity stock funds. In total, investors pulled $10 billion out of the roughly $3 trillion hedge fund industry in the first 10 months of 2018, data from eVestment show.
As Jana's regular hedge funds have languished, its activist strategy, which was launched in October 2010, has been quietly beating rivals, boasting an average return of 15 percent a year ahead of the S&P 500's comparable 11 percent return. 
Among activists, some of which make vocal demands, Jana has a reputation for working collaboratively and often behind the scenes. It has run only one proxy contest.
David DiDomenico, who co-manages Jana's ""passive investment strategy"" with Rosenstein, will stay at the firm and Rosenstein will continue to co-manage the JSI fund with Scott Ostfeld.
Last year, Jana announced plans to launch a second activist portfolio, the Jana Impact Capital fund, which will be managed by Charles Penner and Daniel Hanson. Jana last year partnered with the California State Teachers Retirement System, or Calstrs, in pushing iPhone-maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop new tools to help parents limit children's time on mobile devices.
Rosenstein traces his investing roots to private equity and he founded the firm in 2001 with an eye to push for better capital allocation and operational improvements in the public markets. 

The JSI fund looks more like a private equity vehicle than a hedge fund, where investors lock money up for at least three years and send money when the firm is ready to make an investment. It also allows investors to size up their bets alongside the firm, giving Jana more firepower for its investments.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:39PM ET</span>",JPMorgan misses fourth-quarter profit estimates as bond trading slumps,"By Elizabeth Dilts and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as a slump in bond trading revenue overpowered strong consumer loan growth and record revenues.
It was the first time JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has underperformed earnings-per-share expectations in 16 quarters, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) equity analyst Jason Goldberg.
JPMorgan was the second large U.S. bank to point the finger at choppy markets in December for its bond revenue losses.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) on Monday posted a sharp drop in fixed income revenue, blaming widening credit spreads, or the premium investors demand for holding corporate bonds over safer U.S. Treasury securities.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which report earnings later this week, are likely to say they experienced the same effects in their large fixed-income trading businesses.
Well Fargo & Co (N:WFC), which relies less on trading, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue missed expectations as revenue across all its banking units declined, especially at community banking.
Despite an 18 percent drop in JPMorgan's quarterly fixed-income revenue, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said one down quarter does not make a trend.
""The outlook for growth in the economy is still strong,"" she said on an analyst call. ""The consumer is still strong and healthy. We are expecting to see maybe slower but still global growth going forward.""
Its shares were up 1.3 percent to $102.30 on Tuesday. 
(GRAPHICS: JPMorgan Corporate & Investment Bank Revenue breakdown - https://tmsnrt.rs/2T1tf65)
The bank increased its provision for credit losses by $240 million from a year earlier, with roughly two-thirds for commercial and industrial loans.
Lake said the rise in provisions were ""driven by literally a handful of names across a handful of sectors.""
'MORE PARANOID THAN YOU ARE'
Asked about any broader concerns over clients' credit-worthiness, Lake said, ""There's nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we're looking. We're more paranoid than you are.""
JPMorgan's equities trading revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier, helped by strength in prime brokerage, which serves hedge fund clients. 
Investment banking revenue rose 3 percent on higher advisory fees, even as underwriting fees declined.
Revenue in asset and wealth management fell 5 percent as market declines translated into lower asset levels and management and performance fees. 
Trading desks at banks have been shaken by global growth concerns and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. Bank stocks underperformed the S&P 500 index (SPX) in 2018 by 13 percent.
On a conference call with reporters, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the partial U.S. government shutdown will hurt the U.S. economy if it persists.
""We don't know exactly what it is going to do, but it is not a positive,"" he said. 
JPMorgan said expenses rose 6 percent, outpacing revenue growth as it invested in technology, marketing and real estate.
Net income increased 67 percent to $7.07 billion, or $1.98 per share, from a year ago, when it took a one-time charge due to the U.S. tax overhaul. But it missed analysts' average estimate of $2.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net interest income was up 9 percent to $14.5 billion on higher interest rates in 2018.
The bank's average core loan book grew 6 percent from the year-earlier quarter.

Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $26.80 billion, shy of the average analyst expectation of $26.83 billion.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>",Lighthizer saw no progress on U.S.-China key trade issues: Senator Grassley,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not see any progress made on structural issues during trade talks with China last week, Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday.
Grassley, who held a meeting with Lighthizer on Friday, said the top trade negotiator commented very positively on China's soybean purchases, which resumed in modest amounts last month after Washington and Beijing agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.
""But he (Lighthizer) said that there hasn't been any progress made on structural changes that need to be made,"" Grassley said in his weekly conference call with reporters, adding that those issues would include intellectual property, stealing trade secrets and putting pressure on corporations to share information.
The meeting came after mid-level U.S. and Chinese officials met in Beijing to discuss China's offers to address U.S. complaints about intellectual property theft and increase purchases of U.S. goods and services. The two sides are trying to reach a deal that avoids a scheduled March 2 escalation of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
Grassley said Chinese officials were due to visit Washington for further trade talks in a couple of weeks. ""From my point of view ... the economy of China is suffering ... there is a chance for progress,"" he said. 
A USTR spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment on Grassley's remarks to reporters. The news briefly tempered U.S. stock market sentiment.
U.S. officials expect China's top trade negotiator may visit Washington this month, signaling that higher-level discussions are likely to follow last week's talks with mid-level officials in Beijing. 
Halfway through a 90-day truce in the U.S.-China trade war agreed to on Dec. 1 when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina, there have been few details provided of any progress made.
But China has purchased around 5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans from the 2018 harvest so far. China in 2017 had booked more than 23 million tonnes of U.S. soy, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
China last week during the talks also approved five genetically modified U.S. crops for import, a move that could boost U.S. grain sales to China. 
Trump has vowed to increase tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on March 2 unless China takes steps to protect U.S. intellectual property, end policies that force American companies to turn over technology to a Chinese partner, allow more market access for U.S. businesses and reduce other non-tariff barriers to American products. 
The timeline is seen as ambitious, but the resumption of face-to-face negotiations has bolstered hopes of a deal.

China has repeatedly played down complaints about intellectual property abuses, and has rejected accusations that foreign companies face forced technology transfers.

The private equity firm would pay between $21 and $22 per share in a deal that would likely be announced this week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The deal would represent a premium of 10 percent or more as the shares were recently trading just above $19, according to the report. 
Arconic shares rose almost 4 percent, while Apollo shares were up 2 percent on Tuesday.
Reuters had reported in October that Apollo Global was in advanced negotiations to acquire Arconic.
Elliott Management Corp, the activist hedge fund that sits on Arconic board, is working to address potential liabilities weighing on the sale process for the U.S. aluminum products maker, Reuters had reported in November.

Arconic declined to comment, while Apollo Global did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) on Tuesday posted a slight beat in fourth-quarter profit but forecast a decline in revenue growth in the first quarter, hit by a partial government shutdown and worries about whether airlines can raise fares in an uncertain global economy.
Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline, warned that revenue per mile flown would be hurt in the current quarter by the timing of Easter, increasing foreign exchange headwinds, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which entered its 25th day on Tuesday.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are enduring long airport lines as an increasing number of security screeners are not showing up for work during the shutdown, and airlines face delays in federal certification for new routes and aircraft.
Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said the partial shutdown will cost $25 million per month in reduced government travel.
JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker calculated that Delta generates about $475 million in annual revenue through negotiated government fares. The company's first-quarter target for unit revenue, a closely watched metric of revenues per mile flown, could be at risk if the shutdown drags on past January, Baker added.
Baker's estimate does not include the impact of the shutdown on leisure travel by affected government employees. Delta operates around 86 daily flights from Washington-area airports.
Delta said unit revenue will range between flat to 2 percent higher in the first quarter, compared with 3.2 percent growth in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.
Analysts warned that overall corporate travel will be impacted by the shutdown and replaced with lower-yielding leisure travel.
Delta forecast first-quarter earnings between 70 cents and 90 cents per share, below analysts' estimate of 94 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Both Delta and larger rival American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) lowered estimates earlier this month for fourth-quarter revenue per available seat, raising concerns that an economic deceleration was hurting business travel. The forecasts sent their shares sharply lower.
On an adjusted basis, the airline earned $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter, above the $1.27 per share expected by analysts.
Total operating revenue rose 5 percent to $10.74 billion, in line with the Wall Street estimate.

Shares rose 0.1 percent to $47.80.

(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) said on Tuesday Walmart Inc (N:WMT) is leaving its network for commercial and Medicaid prescription drug plans after the two companies failed to agree on pricing.
CVS said the dispute would not impact Walmart's presence in its Medicare Part D pharmacy network, which according to Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee was a bright spot as it represented a larger chunk of CVS' scripts.
""At a time when everyone is working hard to find ways to reduce healthcare costs, Walmart's requested rates would ultimately result in higher costs for our clients and consumers,"" Derica Rice, president of CVS Caremark, said in a statement.
However, CVS said Walmart's Sam's Club division would remain within its pharmacy networks.
Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said the retailer was continuing discussions with CVS Caremark, the company's pharmacy benefits unit.
""We are committed to providing value to our customers across our business, including our pharmacy, but we do not want to give that value to the middleman,"" the retailer said in emailed statement.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been in the crosshairs of the U.S. administration, which in July proposed a rule that would scale back protections that allow rebates between drug manufacturers, insurers and PBMs. 
Since then, details of the rule have not been released.
Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the separation indicates continuing consolidation across the complex sector and a greater push toward narrow networks.
""As the dust settles, we expect further tension among the various players and large integrated players to continue to exert economic pressure on competitors,"" Muken wrote in a client note.
Currently, less than 5 percent of affected CVS Caremark members use Walmart exclusively to fill their prescriptions, CVS said.
The drug store retailer, which completed its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) last year, said it has requested Walmart to remain in its networks through April 30 and did not expect the split to impact its 2019 financial results. 

Shares of CVS Health fell nearly 2 percent to $63.95, while those of Walmart rose 1 percent to $95.96.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus launched a platform on Tuesday allowing traders to buy shares, gold, foreign exchange and other traditional assets with cryptocurrencies, which it says is the world's first regulated tokenized securities exchange.
Belarus has developed a flourishing IT industry and launched a series of business-friendly reforms after a 2015-2016 recession. It passed a law in December 2017 on cryptocurrencies, aiming for them to become a way for companies in the country to attract funding from foreign investors. 
The government has not commented on the new platform but its launch was covered by the state news agency BelTa on Tuesday.
The platform allows traders to buy tokens using cryptocurrencies through a website or app. The tokens track the value of assets such as shares both in Belarus and abroad. The government allowed such transactions to be tax-free until 2023. 
The project was launched by two IT-focused investment companies, VP Capital and Larnabel Ventures. 
""This is the first platform in the world where cryptoinvestors will be able to diversify their investments into real assets,"" VP Capital's owner Viktor Prokopenya told Reuters. 
The platform issued 150 types of tokens corresponding to traditional financial instruments on Tuesday, and expects to increase that to 10,000. Among other things, the platform offers the sale of shares in companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL), gold, oil and metals. 
Within the first two hours, it received 2,000 applications for registration. According to Prokopenya, a trader must undergo a verification procedure to guard against money laundering.
Virtual currencies are volatile and fell sharply year amid increased regulatory scrutiny and amid some instances of hacks and thefts at crypto exchanges. 
""The standards that have been developed in Belarus are correct, they correspond to accepted international practices,"" Prokopenya said. 
""We believe that this project will allow Belarusian companies to attract additional funding both domestically and externally,"" he added. ""Because at the moment the stock market of Belarus is far from the state in which it should be.""
The former Soviet republic, squeezed between Russia and the European Union, is still dominated by the state, weighed down by bureaucracy and inefficient state-owned enterprises, and sustained by Russian money and subsidies.
But despite President Alexander Lukashenko once referring to the internet as ""garbage"", the authorities have offered benefits to the IT industry such as tax breaks. 

The sector has grown by around 20 percent annually. IT exports grew 40 percent in the first nine months of 2018, having crossed $1 billion for the first time in 2017.

The state's biggest private utility's shares have lost 75 percent of their stock value since the start of January, when the company first began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for the fires.
Shares lost 52 percent of their value on Monday after the company said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 protection, and they were down another 28 percent in morning trade in New York.
California politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state's largest private utility to fail.
Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&E stay solvent, but no decisions had been made.
PG&E said on Tuesday that Rothschild Inc banker Roger Kimmel had resigned from the company's board, adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations.
Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while PG&E declined to comment.
PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires.
Its chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires.
The doctrine, known as ""inverse condemnation,"" exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved.
That legal rule could keep PG&E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter.
Still, analysts from Chicago-based brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value.
""The most likely near-term scenario is a fourth-quarter 2018 accounting charge that cuts PG&E's book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure,"" they said.
""Our new fair value estimate for PG&E is $11 per share after considering possible bankruptcy scenarios.""

It was trading at around $6 half an hour after opening on Wall Street.

Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGN), which bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion last year, faces thousands of U.S. lawsuits by people who say its Roundup and Ranger Pro products caused their cancer.
A court in Lyon in southeast France ruled that the approval granted by French environment agency ANSES in 2017 for Roundup Pro 360 had failed to take into account potential health risks.
Bayer has cited regulatory rulings as well as scientific studies that found glyphosate to be safe and the firm is appealing a first U.S. court ruling that awarded $78 million in damages to a school groundskeeper from California.
Glyphosate, which is off-patent and marketed worldwide by dozens of other chemical groups including Syngenta and DowDuPont's Corteva Agriscience, is due to be phased out in France within three years under a pledge by President Emmanuel Macron, who stopped short of an outright ban.
The French court said ANSES had not respected a precautionary principle in French law, notably by not conducting a specific evaluation of health risks for Roundup Pro 360. 
""Despite the European Union's approval of the active substance (glyphosate), the court considered that scientific studies and animal experiments showed Roundup Pro 360, a preparation whose toxicity is greater than that of glyphosate, is a potentially carcinogenic product for humans, suspected of being toxic for human reproduction and for aquatic organisms,"" the court said in a summary of its ruling.
Neither ANSES nor Bayer had immediate comment on the ruling.
""This is a great first, which must be repeated,"" Corinne Lepage, a former French environment minister and member of environment association CRIIGEN that brought the court case, said of the ruling on Twitter.

The association had also contested the process by which the EU renewed the general license for glyphosate, seeking a referral to the European Court of Justice, but the French administrative court said such action was not necessary.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",EU Commission pushes back plan to end veto on digital tax to 2025,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Tuesday pushed back plans to end individual member states' veto power on the introduction of a proposed tax on digital revenues by five years to 2025.
In a non-binding proposal on wider tax reform, the commission recommended EU states end the practice that requires the backing of all 28 members to approve EU tax rules, contrary to other fields where decisions are made by a majority.
The EU executive proposed that in some sectors, such as environment levies, EU states should agree quickly on whether to end the veto. However, for the digital tax, whose progress is blocked by some EU states, the decision to end the veto could be taken by the end of 2025, it said, pushing back the deadline from 2020, as indicated in an initial draft seen by Reuters. 
In another crucial step back from initial plans, on Tuesday the EU Executive led by former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, decided to dismiss a legal procedure that could make tax reforms easier to agree, prompting lawmakers to dub the move as a ""smokescreen"".
The digital tax was proposed last March by the European Union's executive arm. It would impose a 3 percent tax on online revenues of big digital companies, which are accused of paying too little by routing their EU profits to states with lower taxes, like Luxembourg and Ireland.
However, the plan is deadlocked after EU finance ministers failed to agree on the tax in December, despite a last-minute Franco-German plan to salvage the proposal by narrowing its focus to companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB). 
COST OF VETO POWER
The veto power has blocked many key tax reforms, including on energy issues, where the EU still allows subsidies to diesel despite its environmental policy deterring its use, an EU official said.
The fight against tax evasion has also been hampered by the vetoes, the commission said, citing the 25-year resistance by a group of small states, spearheaded by Luxembourg, to introduce common savings tax rules in the EU.
The cost of the vetoes on tax reforms overall are in the hundreds of billions of euros a year, the EU document said.
Ironically, the decision to end veto powers will have to be agreed unanimously by all EU states, as the commission refused on Tuesday to recommend the use of a long-neglected treaty article that would drop the unanimity rule when competition in the EU market is distorted, as in the case of digital taxation.
Invoking this rule would allow decisions on tax reforms to be made by a majority of states.
A commission official said article 116 was not recommended because it could be used only for targeted measures and could face legal challenges. 
""The European Commission is putting up a smokescreen,"" said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold who sits in the EU parliament's committee on tax evasion.
""The plan to overcome unanimity blockades with a unanimous decision is absurd and obviously ineffective,"" he added.
His fellow Green party member, Bas Eickhout, called the move an ""empty gesture."" 
The commission in its document estimated that failure to agree a reform of the corporate tax base, which was first proposed in 2011, has hampered EU growth, with losses worth 180 billion euros ($207 billion) in 2017 alone. 
The lack of agreement on an EU financial transactions tax, first rolled out in 2011, has also cut the bloc's tax revenues by 57 billion euros a year, the document said.

Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were less confident, forecasting an adjusted loss of $0.09 a share in Q1 and $0.32 a share for fiscal year 2019. 
Blue Apron has had a rough go of things since announcing plans to go public in June 2017.

Then, less than a month later, Amazon rolled out its meal-kit business. 
And in August of last year, Blue Apron announced it was having trouble keeping customers. The meal-kit maker said its total number of customers plunged by 24% in the second quarter versus the prior year and that revenue per customer dipped by $1 to $250.

The New York-based hedge fund is asking shareholders to replace four directors, including the company's chief executive who has a seat on the board, and is arguing that the company's deal with another shareholder hurts all investors.
Over the weekend Ashland agreed with Neuberger Berman, which owns 2.8 percent of the company, to add two new directors and have one current director step down.
""Ashland has gone to great lengths to not constructively engage with the Shareholder Nominees,"" Cruiser's founder Keith Rosenbloom said on Tuesday.

Cyber Monday — the Monday after the Thanksgiving holiday — was the biggest U.S. online shopping day ever, with $7.9 billion spent.
Top-selling items online were L.O.L. Surprise & Fingerlings toys;  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (O:TTWO)'s video game Red Dead Redemption 2; Nintendo (T:7974)'s Switch console; streaming devices; and Dell (N:DELL) and Apple (O:AAPL) laptops, Adobe said.
Consumers spent an average 40 percent more per day during the three weeks after Cyber Monday than in the first three weeks of the season, Adobe said. Sales continued to grow until Dec. 17.
While the online sales figures showed how low U.S. unemployment rates and rising wages boosted consumer confidence during the holiday season, department stores continue to struggle.
Further, consumer confidence in 2019 is seen as likely to be strained by rising U.S. interest rates, the ongoing trade dispute with China, market volatility due to concerns over global growth and political deadlock in Washington.
Macy's Inc (N:M) shares plunged 18 percent on Thursday after the department store chain slashed its full-year profit and sales forecast on the back of an anemic holiday season. 
Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) reported similarly muted comparable sales growth for the holidays, sending its shares down as much as 9 percent on Thursday. Shares of  Target  Corp (N:TGT) were down nearly 4 percent even after the retailer posted relatively strong holiday sales growth of nearly 6 percent on Thursday.

Overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season rose 5.1 percent to over $850 billion, hitting a six-year high, as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard (NYSE:MA) report in late December.

917,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>","Now Is the Time to Turn to Hedge Funds, Nordea Chairman Says","(Bloomberg) -- Bjorn Wahlroos, the chairman of the biggest Nordic bank, says now is the time for investors to turn to external managers such as hedge funds to navigate their way through more “complex” strategies.
Doing so will help them cope with the high levels of uncertainty ahead as equities run out of steam, Wahlroos, who heads the board of Nordea Bank Abp, wrote in a column that was posted on the website of a unit of another firm he chairs, Sampo Oyj.
“Active asset management, trading, hedge funds and other alternative strategies seem attractive in the current environment,” Wahlroos said. He cautioned against reading too much into stock-market gains so far this year, which he characterized as a “dead-cat bounce.”
“I wouldn’t start increasing the weight of equities yet,” Wahlroos said. He also urged investors to be discriminating in their choice of external manager, given the huge swings in performance, and said steady returns amid last year’s volatility are a clue investors should utilize.
As an industry, hedge funds lost 4 percent in 2018, marking their biggest decline since 2011. Many lost more than the broader market as political risk, rising concerns on economic growth, prospects of a trade war and the combative stance of President Donald Trump posed a challenge.
“The darkening economic mood has made investors very cautious in the stock markets after a long rally,” he said. “But I don’t believe in any catastrophic slump.”

918,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 09:18AM ET</span>","VW, Ford team up on trucks, eye deals on EVs, self-driving cars","By Ben Klayman and Jan Schwartz
DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday they will join forces on commercial vans and pickups and are exploring shared development of electric and self-driving technology, actions meant to save the automakers billions of dollars.
Ford and VW announced their partnership against the backdrop of the Detroit auto show. The tie-up, which starts with sales of vans and medium-sized pickups in 2022, will not involve a merger or equity stakes, the companies said.
The expanding alliance, which will be governed by a joint committee that includes the CEOs of both companies, highlights the growing pressure on global automakers to manage the costs of developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as technology to meet tougher emissions standards for millions of internal combustion vehicles they will sell in coming years.
Ford will provide more details on how the alliance affects Ford's regional operations in coming weeks, but does not expect any job cuts in Ford plants as a result of the alliance, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said. 
Ford will engineer and build medium-sized pickups for both companies, Volkswagen said. Ford will also engineer and build larger commercial vans for European customers, while Volkswagen will develop and build a city van. Vans could be built in Ford's plant in Turkey, VW said.
The companies estimate the commercial van and pickup cooperation will yield improved annual pretax operating results starting in 2023.
Ford and VW have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, VW Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said. 
VW shares were up 0.6 percent in Frankfurt. Ford gained 0.7 percent to $9.05 in pre-market U.S. trading.
U.S. AND CHINA SLOWDOWNS
Europe's biggest automaker and the No. 2 U.S. automaker have been exploring closer cooperation as trade frictions force carmakers to rethink where they build vehicles for Europe, the United States and China. Slowdowns in the world's largest auto markets - China and the United States - have ratcheted up the pressure to cut costs. 
The tie-up with Volkswagen is a big bet for Ford's Hackett since he took over in May 2017 from the ousted Mark Fields with the mandate to speed up decision-making and cut costs. Some analysts and investors have been frustrated by Ford's laggard stock price and a perceived lack of details from Hackett about the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker's $11 billion restructuring.
Last week, Ford said it would cut thousands of jobs, discontinue building money-losing vehicles and look at closing plants as part of a turnaround effort for its unprofitable European business.
Last month, Volkswagen announced another 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of cost cuts as part of its effort to improve profit margins and fund its shift to electric cars and automated driving.
On Monday, Volkswagen said it would invest $800 million to build an electric vehicle plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to congratulate the city and state in a post on Twitter the following day.

But the White House has been pushing to end subsidies on electric vehicles that would help the plant and the alliance.

The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the Qualcomm suit as groundless in an initial verbal decision, saying the patent in question was not violated by the installation of its chips in Apple's smartphones.
""We are happy with the decision and thank the court for their time and diligence,"" Apple said in a statement. 
""We regret Qualcomm's use of the court to divert attention from their illegal behavior that is the subject of multiple lawsuits and proceedings around the world.""
Qualcomm, waging a worldwide patent battle with Apple, said it would appeal after winning a separate case before a court in Munich in December that enabled it to enforce a ban on the sale of older iPhones in Germany.
""Apple has a history of infringing our patents,"" said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's executive vice president and general counsel. 
""While we disagree with the Mannheim court's decision and will appeal, we will continue to enforce our (intellectual property) rights against Apple worldwide.""
Apple declined to comment on the Mannheim decision. It referred to a statement issued in response to the Dec. 20 ruling in Munich, against which it is appealing.
Apple said at the time that, while a decision on the Munich appeal is outstanding, it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany, although its newer models would remain on sale.
All of its models remain available through carriers and resellers. Gravis, the leading Apple reseller in Germany, said on Tuesday it continued to stock the full range of iPhones.
Apart from the German order, Qualcomm has also secured a ban on the sale of some iPhones in China. Apple, which is also contesting that ruling, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system following the order.
Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces a U.S. antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission which accuses it of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology in a trial that could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.
If the government prevails in the trial that began on Jan. 4, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to device makers like Apple.

Apple is closely watching the FTC case, as it has its own pending lawsuit making similar claims against Qualcomm.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil's Odebrecht offers debt-for-equity swap for Atvos unit - sources,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Corruption-ensnared Odebrecht SA has proposed that creditors take over its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, in exchange for reducing Odebrecht's huge debt load, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. 
The move is the latest sign of the radical way in which Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht, best known for its engineering and construction operations, is remaking itself to renegotiate 70 billion reais in consolidated debt.
Accused of bribing politicians and executives to get contracts throughout Latin America, Odebrecht made a deal two years ago with U.S, Brazilian and Swiss authorities, paying a record $3.5 billion in fines to settle charges.
Atvos has about 12 billion reais ($3.25 billion) in debt with various lenders, including state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), Caixa Economica Federal and development bank BNDES, as well as private Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11). 
A debt-for-equity swap would give Atvos more time to recover without selling plants, a potential alternative to paying off debt. Both sources, who requested anonymity because the talks are private, said this week that a sale of Atvos' assets would not be enough to pay off all outstanding debt.
The sources added that a final decision has not yet been made regarding a swap and that an agreement to transfer Atvos ownership may not be reached.
Atvos is Brazil's second largest ethanol company after Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) and energy firm Cosan (SA:RLOG3).
Atvos' net debt is equivalent to about 10 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. By comparison, debt for the sector's best-run companies is double EBITDA or less.
In preliminary discussions with creditors, Odebrecht said it wanted lenders to swap most of their debt in Atvos for control of the company, but family-owned company Odebrecht wants to keep a minority stake. The sizes of the stakes have yet to be determined, the sources added. 
The largest chunk of Atvos debt is held by state-controlled banks, mainly Banco do Brasil and BNDES, one source said. Banco do Brasil, Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter. Odebrecht, Itau and BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The ethanol company has crushing capacity of 37 million tonnes of sugar cane per year, but has been operating at a much lower level due to financial problems. In the 2017/2018 crop, Atvos processed 25.8 million tonnes, according its annual report.
Odebrecht hired consultancy Canaplan to assess how much debt Atvos' cash flow could handle, and the firm will present a report to lenders about a new business plan.
In November, the corruption-ensnared conglomerate hired advisers to restructure a portion of its bank and bond debt.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 08:14AM ET</span>",PG&E restructuring highlights arcane California legal rule,"By Jessica DiNapoli, Mike Spector and Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - PG&E Corp's chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep the utility owner perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires even beyond the more than $30 billion the company expects to face from recent blazes.
The doctrine, known as ""inverse condemnation,"" exposes California utilities to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. 
That legal rule could keep PG&E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter. 
PG&E on Monday said it was preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this month amid pressure from potentially staggering liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The most recent blaze engulfed the California mountain community of Paradise, destroying homes and killing at least 86 people in the most destructive wildfire in state history. 
Once PG&E files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, creditors can no longer call loans or demand interest payments, lawsuits are paused, and other claimants have to get in line and be subject to the reorganization plan that the company develops.
This could allow PG&E to settle disputes more effectively, and negotiate down its legal bill from the wildfires. PG&E is hoping it can exit bankruptcy in as little as two years, according to its advisers. It envisions no negative impact on its customers. 
However, exiting bankruptcy could take longer if there are more wildfires while PG&E is in bankruptcy, a real threat given that climate change has turned the blazes into an annual occurrence.
A bankruptcy judge could even refuse to approve PG&E's reorganization and exit from court proceedings if the judge finds that inverse condemnation calls into question its future as a viable company, according to U.S. law. 
""Inverse condemnation is a state law but a bankruptcy judge is god,"" said Robert McCullough, principal at energy consulting firm McCullough Research in Portland, Oregon, noting that PG&E faces widespread lawsuits. ""He's going to have to figure out, once he releases the company from bankruptcy, if it's actually a viable entity.""
Private companies generally are not subject to this law, though it varies state by state, McCullough said. California's laws are more extreme than most, he said.
In a regulatory filing on Monday, PG&E questioned whether it could continue to operate as a so-called investor-owned utility while being exposed to that risk. PG&E's exposure to inverse condemnation represents a key issue the utility owner hopes to address should it seek bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
PG&E challenged inverse condemnation in California's Supreme Court unsuccessfully late last year. In a legal filing, the company noted that regulators decide how much private utilities such as PG&E can charge customers, limiting their ability to mitigate pain from crushing liabilities. 
PG&E also highlighted in the legal argument a decision by regulators to deny another private utility's request to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in uninsured costs resulting from settling claims related to wildfires. 
That status quo will cause private utilities to ""face increasing difficulty in obtaining capital from investors, threatening financial harm to the utilities and potentially rendering them economically unsustainable,"" the company said in the petition to California's highest court. 
Absent a court intervention, it would be up to California's state politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom, to come up with a legislative fix to inverse condemnation.
""Bankruptcy is PG&E’s response to the risk of (inverse condemnation),"" said Severin Borenstein, the faculty director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. 
""That leads to the larger question of whether or not this bankruptcy leads to...how we have utilities in California, and if we move from private firms to government owned,"" he said. 
LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANKRUPTCY
PG&E's subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, filed for bankruptcy in 2001, offering hints on how much investors and creditors could recover this time. The subsidiary could not pay its bills during a California energy crisis caused by market manipulation that left consumers dealing with blackouts. 
In PG&E's 2001 bankruptcy, creditors were repaid in full, according to company statements, an unusual scenario most companies in financial distress do not achieve. 
What is more, PG&E shares continued trading between 2001 and 2004, while the subsidiary was in bankruptcy, and never dropped below $6 per share, according to Refinitiv data. PG&E shares ended trading on Monday at $8.38. Most companies lose all equity value as they face bankruptcy.

PG&E's bonds traded sharply lower Monday after the company said it was preparing for bankruptcy, indicating that holders do not expect to recover all of their investment this time.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:28AM ET</span>","Living the tech dream, thanks to a novel apprenticeship program","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While growing up in Seattle, Enrique Rico's mom cleaned the posh homes of Microsoft employees. When Rico tagged along on sick days from school, he dreamed of having the life of a technology worker.
Now, at 26, with no college degree or background in STEM, Rico is working a developer at Avvo, an online marketplace for legal services. 
He is a graduate of a program called Apprenti that provides education and on-the-job training for tech jobs to non-traditional recruits. 
""I never really thought I could do it. But once I dug deep, I gave it my all,"" said Rico.
The Apprenti program is run by the Washington Technology Industry Association in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor. It operates at around 50 companies nationwide with major employers including Microsoft (O:MSFT), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM).
During the first year of the program in 2017, 76 candidates went through the training, which includes about 400 to 780 classroom hours on the front end, compressed into 12 weeks. 
After a year of on-the-job training, the program will finish 2018 with 330 graduates placed into full-time jobs. The class of 2019 is on track to produce more than 700 graduates. 
Amazon expects its apprenticeship cohort to grow from 150 to 1,000 workers in the next few years, said Tammy Thieman, a senior program manager at the ecommerce giant.
The tech industry had 2.8 million openings last year, with 50 percent of them middle-level jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree, according to Jennifer Carlson, executive director of Apprenti.
The pace of hiring is lagging, however, because companies cannot find properly trained workers, she said. 
""This industry needed technical competency at the start - that's a paradigm shift from traditional apprenticeships,"" Carlson added.
Apprenti focuses on veterans, women and under-represented minorities, screening about 2,000 candidates to find 700 candidates for 2019.
Amazon teamed up with Apprenti after its CEO Jeff Bezos made a commitment in 2016 to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021. But the apprenticeship program quickly broadened to find qualified workers for a vast swath of open jobs that required specific credentials. 
""It is not at all unrealistic that freshman going to college today come out already behind,"" said Amazon's Thieman. ""An apprenticeship offers a model to do the learning in a compressed way and then learn the skills on the job. 
While veterans often have valuable skills, they usually do not have a conventional resume or workplace experience. That is why the biggest challenge currently for veterans is being underemployed when they leave the armed forces, said Chris Newsome, vice president of candidate aggregation at RecruitMilitary.
""A lot of these men and women are able to find jobs, but not necessarily careers,"" Newsome said.
New college graduates often will need to complete a program like Apprenti to be job-ready because programming languages and platforms change so quickly. 
Training at universities or even specialty classes at community colleges also do not quite stack up when it comes to hiring for a role such as cloud administrators which require specific certificates, Apprenti's Carlson said. 
Even boot camps for coding do not necessarily do the trick. Rico tried that route first, quitting his $16.50-an-hour job as a salesperson at an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Store to go into a coding program. 
But without a college degree, he did not stand much of a chance against the automated interfaces most big tech companies use to sort through applicants when hiring.
DIVERSITY BOOST
For smaller companies like Avvo, Apprenti is more of a mission. 
""The executives saw the value of a program that gets you talented engineers and does a social good,"" said Hunter Davis, director of engineering at Avvo. 
The company has about 25-30 developers currently on staff, with about 15 percent of them coming through Apprenti.
""They are awesome and full of grit and willing to learn,"" Davis said. 
The leg up for Apprenti grads starts right away. Like Rico, many were previously working minimum wage jobs, with a median income of $28,000 and most without benefits. The starting salary in the Apprenti program is $45,000 during training. 
At six months when candidates begin their on-the-job training, the salary rises $51,000. If they get hired full-time - and almost all of them do - Apprenti grads make at least $75,000.
That is a life-changing salary for most of the participants. 

""I have an apartment and a dog and a cat,"" said Rico, who is still dreaming. ""I’d love to get married and have kids and buy a house. I want to be my own boss. I would love to start my own company.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors' concerns about company leverage hit a ten-year high as they continued to position against the risk of a global trade war, Tuesday's Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's January fund manager survey found.
Fund managers named the dollar as the most crowded trade - ahead of tech stocks - for the second month running, while the trade war scenario topped the list of biggest tail risks for the eighth straight month.
The dollar is seen as the most overvalued since 2002, BAML strategists wrote. The currency was among the best-performing assets globally in 2018, pushed up by U.S. fiscal stimulus and higher tariffs.
Corporate indebtedness, meanwhile, was the chief concern among fund managers for the first time since 2009, the survey found, with a net 48 percent of fund managers believing company balance sheets are overleveraged.
Investors have become reluctant to put money into highly leveraged companies as rising interest rates impact refinancing costs.
Investors reported their worst outlook on global profits since 2008, with a net 52 percent expecting a deterioration in the next year.
Growth expectations also fell: a net 60 percent of investors surveyed think global growth will weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook since July 2008.
But investors are pricing in ""secular stagnation"" rather than a fully-fledged recession, BAML strategists said, as fund managers add risk via tech stocks and emerging market assets. Only 14 percent expect a global recession this year.
""The good news was inflation expectations plunged, allowing investors to discount a new dovish Fed and a ...steepening of (the) yield curve,"" the strategists said.
They said contrarian themes and trades for January for investors keen to swim against the current would include buying cyclical leveraged stocks, emerging currencies, U.S. industrials and small caps, and European stocks.
(GRAPHIC: Most crowded trade - https://tmsnrt.rs/2AKbOji)
EUROPE, UK STILL OUT OF FAVOR
In Europe, growth outlooks and equity allocations both hit seven-year lows, BAML's survey of European fund managers showed.
UK stocks remained the least favored by both global and European investors, with a net 39 percent of the latter intending to be underweight the region over the next 12 months.
""Brexit uncertainty increases as we move closer to the deadline, resulting in the highest proportion of fund managers saying sterling is undervalued in the 17 years of the survey,"" wrote strategists.
With a slew of bad news for the autos sector recently, European investors' allocations to car stocks hit their lowest in eight years.
European fund managers have also grown more defensive, with positioning in cyclical versus defensive sectors at its lowest in three years, BAML said.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:23AM ET</span>",Facebook to invest $300 million to help local news survive,"By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) will invest $300 million over three years in local news globally as it faces blistering criticism over its role in the erosion of the news business worldwide.
The investment in time and money is a significant expansion of a plan to help newsrooms in the U.S. and abroad create and sustain viable business models to survive, the company said on Tuesday.
Unlike earlier investments in the news business, this latest round is distinguished by how it is not tied to Facebook-related products, recipients of the investments say. 
Earlier rounds of investments in the news business were designed to encourage publishers to rely on delivering its products over Facebook, which eventually hurt many news organizations when Facebook's strategies shifted.
""We're going to continue fighting fake news, misinformation, and low quality news on Facebook,"" Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president of Global News Partnerships said in a statement. ""But we also have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to help local news organizations grow and thrive.""
Critics have slammed Facebook for its role in providing a platform for hate speech, misinformation and political meddling.
The first round of investments in the U.S. will help bolster resources for local reporting, help research how to use technology to improve news gathering and create new products, recruit ""trainee community journalists"" and place them in local newsrooms and also help fund a program modeled after the Peace Corp, which will place 1,000 journalists in local newsrooms over five years. 
The recipients of the investments include the Pulitzer Center, Report for America, Knight-Lenfest Local News Transformation Fund, the Local Media Association and Local Media Consortium, the American Journalism Project and the Community News Project.
Fran Wills, CEO of the Local Media Consortium, an alliance of 80 news companies representing 2,200 outlets, said Facebook is helping the group create a branded content program aimed at attracting new advertisers. ""Facebook is making this investment to help support local media companies ... open up new revenue streams that will support local journalism,"" she said.
Last December, it announced a $6 million investment in local publishers in Britain. It also plans to expand an ""Accelerator"" program it launched last year to help local newsrooms such as the San Francisco Chronicle and the Denver Post improve its ability to attract subscribers and membership donations.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>","UnitedHealth profit beats on strength in Optum, insurance units","(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by growth in services business as well as its mainstay health insurance plans.
The largest U.S. health insurer kicked off earnings season for the sector, reporting $46.23 billion in sales in its insurance business, an 11.1 percent rise from a year earlier.
Revenue from Optum, which includes a pharmacy benefits management business, grew 13 percent to $27.56 billion in the quarter, benefiting from growth in care delivery, behavioral health and health financial services, the company said. 
UnitedHealth and its Optum unit are set to face tough competition this year, as health insurer rivals  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) and  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) entered into separate deals with large benefit managers.
UnitedHealth's 2018 medical care ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, improved to 81.6 percent from 82.1 percent last year.
The health insurer also affirmed its 2019 profit forecast. 
""Despite the beat, management did not increase its 2019 guidance. This is not surprising to us. Over the years, UnitedHealth has typically been conservative,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said in a client note, calling the results a ""solid finish"" to 2018. 
Net earnings attributable to shareholders fell 16 percent to $3.04 billion, or $3.10 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
Excluding items, the company earned $3.28 per share. Total revenue rose about 12 percent to $58.42 billion.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.21 per share and revenue of $58.01 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Shares of the Hopkins, Minnesota-based company rose 1.6 percent to $252 in light trading before the opening bell.

929,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Mene MENE,"You might not yet have heard the name Mene (Vancouver: MENE), but you could soon enough, especially if you’re in the market for fine jewelry, explains Frank Holmes, CEO & chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors and editor of Frank Talk.
Founded in 2017 by Roy Sebag, co-founder of gold financial services firm Goldmoney, and Diana Widmaier-Picasso, granddaughter of — you guessed it —Pablo Picasso, Mene’s mission is to disrupt the gold jewelry market by selling directly to the consumer and pricing its merchandise fairly and transparently.
Unlike traditional sellers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Cartier, which sometimes have high premiums, Mene prices its jewelry based on the changing value of gold.
It then charges a 15 percent to 20 percent design and production fee on top of that. What also sets the company apart is that its jewelry—from earrings to necklaces, bracelets to charms—is made of 24-karat gold or platinum. No alloys, no insets of diamonds or other stones.
That’s done to help the pieces retain their value over time. Here at U.S. Global Investors, we believe gold is money and a timeless investment. Mene, which takes its name from the Aramaic word for “money,” has clearly run with that idea, going so far as to trademark the phrase “investment jewelry.”
It’s a business model that seems to have resonated with consumers and investors alike. In its first 10 months of operation, Mene did as much as $7 million in sales in more than 53 countries, as of October 2018.

Midland Capital is run by two brothers and they own over 50% of the stock and they both are in their mid-sixties, so we simply think a sale is near. They have been with the bank for over 40 years.
The bank pays a small cash dividend; they never took TARP money, so it is as solid as they come. And they don't make any stupid loans. While they should be growing faster, they are playing it safe and earnings could double with another nearby bank taking them out very soon.
With their real estate, the book value is rock-solid at around $39 a share. The stock is now trading at 33% under book. This is a rare find in today's world, with many banks getting beaten down. In my view, the stock is worth at least $42 in a takeover — or 60% more than recent prices.
The bank is always making money — even with the CEO's pay high relative to other smaller banks. This leaves a lot of fat to cut.
The bank has been around for over 100 years. In my opinion, this stock is as safe as it gets near a market top. Load up under $28 today; from there, we see limited downside risk.

931,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Cardinal Health CAH," Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) is one of 3 large pharmaceutical distributors in the United States that together account for more than 90% of the pharmaceutical distribution market share, explains Ben Reynolds, income expert and editor of Sure Dividend.
What makes Cardinal Health stand apart from its competitors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and McKesson (MCK) is its extraordinary dividend history. Cardinal Health is a Dividend Aristocrat — an S&P 500 stock with 25+ years of rising dividends — thanks to its 32 consecutive years of dividend increases.
While Cardinal Health has a long history of growth as shown by its excellent dividend history, the company has struggled in recent years along with the entire pharmaceutical distribution industry. Cardinal Health generated earnings-per-share of $5.24 in fiscal 2016, versus $5.00 in fiscal 2018. The company expects earnings-per-share to barely grow in fiscal 2019.
Weakness in the pharmaceutical industry is a result largely of declining margins. Margins are declining due to several reasons:
• Pricing pressure from competitors
• Social and political pressure from distributor’s role in the opioid epidemic
• Hints that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could enter the industry
All of these factors have weighed on margins and the stock prices of pharmaceutical distributors. But with pessimism comes low valuations — and opportunity.
Cardinal Health appears deeply undervalued. The company’s stock price reached a high of over $90 back in 2015. It traded under $50 in December of 2018, while earnings-per-share are 14% higher in fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2015. 
Cardinal Health’s management has taken advantage of low share prices by engaging in significant share repurchases. The company reduced its share count by 2.5% in fiscal 2018. And the rate of share repurchases has increased since.
We don’t expect Cardinal Health to return to the double-digit earnings-per-share growth rates that it has generated in the past. But we do expect earnings-per-share growth to stabilize after fiscal 2019 and return to growth of around 5% annually driven by a combination of share repurchases and organic growth.
This growth combined with the company’s high dividend yield of around 4% gives investors expected total returns of approximately 9% annually at Cardinal Health before valuation multiple gains.
With Cardinal Health being deeply undervalued, we expect significantly higher returns for shareholders when the current negative environment for pharmaceutical distributors improves. In the meantime, investors will benefit from Cardinal Health’s high dividend and share repurchases.

932,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- United Parcel Service UPS," United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) is a global leader in logistics, offering a broad range of solutions including transporting packages and freight, facilitating international trade, and deploying advanced technology to more efficiently manage the world of business, explains Ingrid Hendershot, value-oriented money manager and editor of Hendershot Investments.
Headquartered in Atlanta, UPS serves more than 220 countries and territories worldwide. UPS has a flexible capital allocation strategy which allows the company to reinvest in its business, make dividends a priority and take a balanced approach to share repurchases.
Long-term investors should package up UPS for their portfolio. Since going public in 1999, UPS has parceled out brown boxes of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks which have totaled more than $73 billion.
UPS increased its dividend 10% in 2018 to an annual rate of $3.64 per share with the dividend currently yielding an attractive 3.7%. UPS has either increased or maintained its dividend every year for nearly 50 years.
During the next few years, UPS plans to annually invest $6.5 billion to $7 billion, about 10% of revenues, in new technology, aircraft and automated capacity, taking advantage of the 100% deductibility permitted for capital investments under the new tax law.
At the same time, UPS expects to continue to increase its dividend and plans to repurchase $1 billion of its shares in 2018. Management reaffirmed 2018 adjusted EPS in a range of $7.03-$7.37, which represents high double-digit growth.
Operating cost reductions between 2018 and 2022 should result in an incremental increase to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.00 to $1.20 by 2022. 
UPS — my top pick for conservative investors in 2019 — is a high-quality, highly profitable market leader with strong cash flows, an attractive dividend and a solid outlook for growth.

933,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Chevron CVX,"Our 2019 market view remains cautious as continued pressures from a macro-economic standpoint weight on an already tenuous technical landscape. Based on these views, we feel a “safety-first” oriented approach with a focus on high-quality, well-managed companies is the best way to move forward in the new year, notes Zach Jonson, senior portfolio manager for Stack Financial Management. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) — our top value-oriented pick for 2019 — is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies with exploration, production, and refining operations that span the globe. The company has its hands in all aspects of the energy life cycle including upstream, midstream, and downstream/chemical operations which gives them the ability to navigate the ever-changing commodity environment. 
Chevron’s high-quality assets allow for strong profit growth and free cash flow generation in a wide range of oil price environments, making them an ideal holding for 2019.
The collapse in oil prices that took place from the latter part of 2014 until early 2016 forced companies within the Energy sector to recapitalize and focus on balance sheet improvement. Chevron’s scale and efficiency allowed them to weather the storm better than most as they were able to maintain a consistent dividend payout throughout the cycle.
In fact, in January of 2018, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 4% to $1.12, marking 30 straight years of annual dividend payout increases. As oil prices rebounded, Chevron’s management team remained steadfast outlining a plan that focused on dividend growth, balance sheet strength, and the utilization of surplus cash for repurchases. 
As we stand today, Chevron is on track to produce multiple years of positive Free Cash Flow driven by recently completed major capital projects. The completion of these projects allows Chevron to reduce capital spending over the next few years while still maintaining the ability to ramp up production.
From a valuation standpoint, shares are trading at 12.9 times 2019 EPS estimates which is well below the 10-year average of approximately 15 times. From a cash flow standpoint, Chevron provides investors a forward FCF Yield in excess of 6%, which coupled with a 3.9% dividend yield, offers investors ample return to offset possible oil price volatility. 
In a sector dominated by highly cyclical investment opportunities, CVX is a true high-quality story. The company is a well-managed, cash-oriented firm that offers strong production growth when most peers are struggling to lower costs. Chevron offers investors the ability to maintain exposure to the volatile energy sector while still maintaining a “safety-first” mentality.

Cloud networking brings efficiency and scale benefits to legacy networking environments, explains Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher.
Arista’s CloudVision campus for unified wireless & wired leverages its acquisition of Mojo Networks. In our view, Arista has a huge untapped potential with telcos, ISPs, and cloud titans.
In August, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Arista ended their patent infringement battle. Arista paid Cisco $400 million in cash, ending a cash drain and the uncertainty of litigation.
Revenue and EPS are growing faster than the company's share price. In 3Q18, revenue rose 28% from the prior year and non-GAAP EPS rose 31%. Management’s 4Q18 guidance calls for roughly 30% revenue and EPS growth. Its full-year forecast calls for EPS growth of 39%.
Valuations are attractive. The stock has retraced with the Technology sector and the overall market, even as analysts continue to raise their EPS estimates.
The shares are trading at a two-year forward relative P/E of 1.65, close to the five-year average of 1.60; the PEG ratio of 1.47 is below the average of 2.0 for peers. Year-end weakness in the stock has provided an attractive entry point. Our 12-month target price is $320.

The U.S. embassy in Germany said on Sunday that Ambassador Richard Grenell had told German companies involved in the project that they could face sanctions if they continued with the plan that is already far advanced.
""The letter is a totally unacceptable threat to German companies,"" OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele, a German national who has run the Austrian firm since 2015, told the business daily.
""Europe must not allow itself to be patronized by the U.S. in matters of energy politics,"" he said.
A U.S. embassy spokesman has said Washington intended the letter to be a ""clear message"" rather than a threat.
The $11 billion pipeline project, being implemented by Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) with Western firms including Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (WINT.UL), aims to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
President Donald Trump, who wants to export more shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, has said Germany is ""captive"" to Moscow in its reliance on Russian pipeline gas.
European critics of Nord Stream 2 say Ukraine's gas transit business will suffer if the pipeline comes online, and say Ukraine's security concerns about Russia must also be addressed.
Companies and politicians backing the project say it is vital to secure future supply capacity.

""We are not investing in a dependency on Russia but in a diversification of gas transport routes into Europe,"" OMV's Seele said, adding Europe had underestimated how soon British and Dutch production would fall, raising the region's import needs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that shareholders elect two dissident nominees at Luby's Inc after the current board oversaw ""alarming underperformance"" at the casual dining chain.
ISS recommended votes for Jeff Gramm, whose hedge fund Bandera Capital is running the proxy contest, and his father, Philip Gramm, a former U.S. senator from Texas, according to the report seen by Reuters. Bandera asked shareholders to elect four dissidents.
The report criticized Luby's board for standing by as company's stock price deteriorated at a time the broader industry thrived. ""The incumbent board has overseen alarming underperformance over the past decade and deteriorating financials over the past five years,"" the report said. The share price of Luby's, which owns hamburger chain Fuddruckers, has dropped 37 percent in the last 52 weeks.
ISS also wrote that current board members are out of touch with shareholders' concerns and that ""further change is not only warranted, it is overdue.""
A spokesman for Luby's said the company was pleased that ISS did not throw its weight behind Bandera's other two nominees, Savneet Singh and Stacy Hock. ""We strongly disagree with their recommendations to vote for Senator Philip Gramm and his son Jeff Gramm – a familial combination that ISS itself described as 'suboptimal,'"" a spokesman said.

942,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",A PG&E Bankruptcy May Be What California Needs for a Utility Fix,"(Bloomberg) -- For days, California Governor Gavin Newsom and lawmakers deflected questions about what they’d do to keep the state’s largest utility, PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG), from going under. On Monday, their response became clear: Not much.
At least not until the power giant has actually gone bankrupt.
Once the San Francisco-based company has made a Chapter 11 filing -- in what’s likely to be one of the largest U.S. utility bankruptcies of all time -- California can jump into the case as a party and wield its power as one of the few entities that must sign off on the company’s final plan to emerge. That leaves room for Newsom to still carry heavy weight in the outcome.
At a press conference Monday, the new Democratic governor began laying out what he wants: safety, reliability and affordability for Californians, even as PG&E takes steps to address its $30 billion in potential wildfire liabilities. In a statement earlier that day, he also keyed in on a top priority: keeping the state on track to “make progress toward our climate goals.”
The filing, viewed by some as the worst outcome, may actually help California decide what type of utility is right for a state with an ever-increasing risk of multibillion-dollar wildfires, according to Severin Borenstein, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Options such as breaking up the utility giant or turning it into government-owned entities are likely to be hashed out in concert with the bankruptcy proceeding, he said.
“It will accelerate the discussion that was being had before bankruptcy, which is what is the appropriate structure of utilities given the increased wildfire risk?” Borenstein said. “If we are going to have investor-owned utilities, how do we deal with the fact that they may face multibillion liabilities?”
Deteriorating Finances
Newsom and other lawmakers showed little interest in bailing out the beleaguered company. PG&E determined a bankruptcy filing was “the only viable option” to deal with its deteriorating finances after discussions with state officials, Steven Malnight, senior vice president of energy supply and policy at PG&E’s utility unit, said in an interview.
A bankruptcy reorganization would allow PG&E to operate and keep the lights on as a court considers a restructuring that could save it.
And it would do something else. “It diversifies the responsibility for what plays out,” said Kit Konolige, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
“So far, I would say the politicians have been very successful to avoid being the bad guy,” he said. “Clearly the one in the barrel is the utility. What politician is going to step up and say, ‘I want to save PG&E?’”
At the press conference late Monday, Newsom characterized the utility’s woes as vastly different than the situation that led its utility unit to go bankrupt in 2001. “We are not in an energy crisis,” he said.
He said all options are on the table for the company. “There’s plenty we can do to influence” decisions, even though PG&E’s fate would be decided by a bankruptcy judge, he said.
‘Vested Interest’
It’s unlikely that the pressure will be off Newsom and the legislature to act. Chapter 11 gives creditors, the company and other stakeholders room to negotiate, which surely would include the state, said Stephen Nielander, adjunct lecturer at San Diego State University.
“You’re really talking about a vital interest asset,” Nielander said. The state has “a vested interest in our citizens being covered and protected. Does that get them a seat at the table? It’s hard to imagine that they’re not.”
It may also pave the way for change in California’s relationship with its power companies. PG&E’s move “underscores the reality that the state cannot regulate utilities as we have for the last 100 years,” Betty Yee, the state’s controller, said in a Twitter post.
“The state needs a complete assessment of our entire electricity grid,” she said in a follow-up email.
‘Sufficient Resources’
The California Public Utilities Commission said it was closely monitoring PG&E, as are the governor’s office and state agencies. The commission would have to sign off on any rate increases or changes required to help the company exit a bankruptcy so would be part of any proceedings.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares bounced on Tuesday after China signaled more stimulus measures to soften the blow from a tariff war with the United States, triggering relief in trade-sensitive tech, mining, and car stocks as some results also impressed.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) jumped 0.8 percent at the open but quickly trimmed gains to trade up 0.4 percent by 0930 GMT. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) hit a session low after GDP figures showed the German economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2018, the weakest rate in five years, though it managed to avoid a technical recession.
Overall economic sentiment in the euro zone has slumped over the past months, with the European Commission's sentiment indicator falling to its lowest ebb since 2012 in December. 
Sectors reliant on trade and exports to China, such as tech, industrials, basic resources, and autos, were the top gainers on Tuesday though they pared gains fast after the open.
Some investors were doubtful this stimulus would have much impact on European exporters.
""To give a real boost to European exporters, we would need more than just an announcement on tax cuts, we would need commitments to infrastructure investment (from China),"" said Martin Moeller, co-head of Swiss and global equity portfolio management at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva.
The autos sector (SXAP) jumped to its highest since Dec. 5 on the stimulus news and after a strong update from  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) soothed investors' concerns about carmakers facing slowing demand in China.
Shares in the French carmaker climbed to their highest since mid-November after reporting record sales for 2018. The stock pared gains fast, though, trading up just 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT.
Italian banks sold off, dragging Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) down into negative territory, down 0.2 percent.
Italy's biggest lenders Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) fell 2.8 and 1.8 percent after a report in Il Sole 24 Ore that the European Central Bank has asked lenders to fully cover impaired loans by around 2026.
UBI Banca (MI:UBI), Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and BPER Banca (MI:EMII) also fell 3.8 to 6.7 percent, the biggest Italian fallers.
""If things get much worse (for Italian banks) the ECB will come and help - I think they will consider a second round of targeted refinancing operations,"" said UBP's Moeller. 
""But before you get this the share prices might come down significantly from here,"" he added.
M&A was a driver with Swedish telecoms company Millicom (ST:TIGOsdb) up 4.7 percent after a bid from Liberty Latin America (O:LILA).
Kinnevik (ST:KINVb), the majority stakeholder in Millicom, rose 3 percent among top STOXX gainers. 

Chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli (S:LISN) fell 2.8 percent after reporting sales rose 5.1 percent in 2018, in line with its goal, but highlighted the market environment remained ""very challenging"".

945,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",A $1.8 Trillion Investor Says U.S. Stock Rally Has Years to Run,"(Bloomberg) -- The record bull market in U.S. equities may still have several years to run, according to one of the world’s biggest investors.
Capital Group Cos., which oversaw $1.8 trillion at the end of September, acknowledges that we’re in the late stage of the economic cycle, a period that generally lasts one to three years -- and this time shouldn’t be any different, it says. Earnings at U.S. companies will grow about 10 percent in 2019 and be slower but still “nicely positive” in 2020, said Andy Budden, investment director for Asia-Pacific at the money manager. That’s because the outlook won’t be too impacted by quickening inflation, he said.
In fact, the allocation to U.S. shares in Capital Group’s flagship global equity fund is the highest in decades, according to Budden. While “opportunities don’t come easy anymore” in the late-stage bull market, there are still chances to buy if investors are “selective about what they own,” he says. He favors a mixture of stocks with the potential for long-term growth, such as the big-name technology and internet companies, and more defensive shares that will perform better in market downturns.
“Given that this expansion has been pretty measured, I think we’re expecting that the late stage of the cycle will probably also be quite measured as well,” Budden said in an interview in Singapore. “And it doesn’t have to end in a recession.”
U.S. equities have bounced back since Christmas Eve, after a brutal sell-off last quarter that sent the S&P 500 Index down almost 20 percent from peak to trough. Budden says the rout was neither surprising nor a reason to change his investment outlook. If anything, it was a chance to buy, he says.
One of the markets Capital Group is watching closely this year is China. Budden expects the Chinese government to introduce fiscal-stimulus policies in response to slowing growth, just as it did in 2015 and 2016, but the scale will be smaller this time because authorities no longer expect such steps to be as effective.
China will cut taxes “on a larger scale” to help support its slowing economy, according to a statement attributed to senior economic policy officials on Tuesday.
Brexit Confusion
On Brexit, Capital Group says it isn’t sure what the ultimate outcome will be as the U.K. prepares for a key vote Tuesday that’s expected to see Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal rejected in parliament. But most scenarios imply pain for the British economy for some time to come, according to Budden. That said, the nation has some good fundamentals, with everything from a dynamic economy and strong education system to “great global companies” that aren’t that reliant on the U.K. for revenue, he said.
“We really don’t know what’s going to happen,” Budden said.
Budden pointed to Japan as a market that has seen “dramatic progress” since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power in 2012. He says the changes in rules for companies and investors, including the revisions to the corporate-governance and stewardship codes last year, show that Abe’s government continues to have an impact. Capital Group’s Japan equity specialists are bullish about the nation’s stocks, he says, after the benchmark Topix index tumbled 18 percent last year for its worst annual performance since 2011.
Ultimately, Budden says he spends much of his time thinking about U.S. shares. He expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once more and then hold rates at that level. But it’s incomplete to talk just about borrowing costs, he says, because investors must also factor in quantitative tightening. Still, with the prospects for continued earnings growth, he says U.S. shares don’t look that expensive at less than 16 times expected profits.
“We think that U.S. equity markets in particular should be able to support some reasonably positive returns over the next couple of years,” he said.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:54AM ET</span>",Tokyo court denies Nissan Ghosn's latest bail request,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday denied former Nissan Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn's request for release on bail after his indictment last week on two new charges, making it likely the once-feted executive remains jailed for months.
Lawyers for Ghosn have appealed the decision and could receive a response within the next day.
Ghosn awaits a lengthy criminal trial that could be as long as six months away, his lawyers have said. It is rare in Japan for defendants who deny their charges to be granted bail ahead of trial.
The executive has remained in a detention center in Tokyo since Nov. 19, when he was first arrested on allegations of under-reporting his salary for five years through 2015.
The court did not give a reason for denying bail. At a hearing last week, when his lawyers asked for reasons for his continued detention, the court cited concerns that Ghosn would try to flee or tamper with evidence.
Ghosn was indicted on Friday on charges of aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008, and understating his salary for three additional years through March 2018. He has denied the charges.
His arrest sent shockwaves through the auto industry and rocked Nissan's alliance with Mitsubishi Motors Corp and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
Ghosn, who masterminded Nissan's financial turnaround two decades ago, has since been removed from chairmanship positions at Nissan and Mitsubishi, but remains chairman and chief executive at Renault.
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, said it supports Renault's decision to keep Ghosn at its helm unless it becomes clear he will be ""chronically incapacitated"" by the Japanese investigation, officials said on Monday.
The prospect of a lengthy detention could increase pressure on the Renault board and shareholders including France's government to appoint permanent new leadership for the carmaker. 
Tuesday is likely to see ""important developments"" in relation to that question, one French official said.
UNDER SCRUTINY
The case has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.
Ghosn's wife, Carole Ghosn, has complained about her husband's ""harsh treatment"" in detention, including being held in a small, unheated room and being pressured by prosecutors to confess, according to a letter she wrote to Human Rights Watch's Japan director Kanae Doi.
She urged the group to ""shine a light on the harsh treatment of my husband and the human rights-related inequities inflicted upon him by the Japanese justice system.""
Doi said in an e-mail to Reuters that the country's justice system ""certainly warrants the international pressure and attention it is getting now.""
Doi also forwarded a comment from Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams, who in an opinion piece published in the Diplomat magazine on Thursday said, ""Ghosn's case is emblematic of serious and longstanding problems in Japan's criminal justice system, which affect ordinary Japanese citizens on a daily basis.""

Japan's Ministry of Justice was unreachable for comment outside of business hours.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:54AM ET</span>",UK gambling stocks drop after U.S. DOJ reverses opinion on internet betting,"(Reuters) - Shares of British betting companies, which have been pushing into the United States market because of tighter regulations at home, fell after the U.S. Department of Justice called for wider restrictions on all gambling on the internet.
UK bookies such as William Hill Plc , Paddy Power Betfair Plc and 888 Holdings Plc fell between 1.5 percent to 7 percent on Tuesday after the U.S. regulator reversed its 2011 opinion that made only sports betting online illegal under the Wire Act.
The 2011 reading of the federal law, which came into effect in 1961, prohibits certain types of gambling in the United States including sports betting, but the regulator now says the provisions under the act must now be considered in tandem with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.
The opinion by the regulator's Office of Legal Counsel, dated Nov. 2, 2018 but disclosed only late on Monday, added that the new interpretation of the law's scope will likely be contested in courts. 
UK gambling companies had been pulling off deals to move into the U.S. market after a U.S. Supreme court ruling in May took the United States a step closer to legal sports betting in numerous states, perhaps nationwide, rather than select states like Nevada - home to gambling capital Las Vegas.
GVC Holdings Plc in July agreed to set up an online betting platform in the U.S. with hotel and casino operator MGM Resorts. William Hill in September signed a 25-year sports betting deal with casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc. 

Peel Hunt analysts said in a note that the implications of the developments may not become clear until the U.S. government returns from a shutdown and perhaps until prosecutions start.

The Zurich-based reinsurer said on Tuesday it expects the year-end rough patch to result in a pre-tax combined claims burden from natural catastrophes and large man-made disasters of $2.9 billion for the full year 2018. 
Industry-wide, the company sees global insured losses of $81 billion, well shy of the record figure of $144 billion of 2017. The 2018 estimate, if it holds, would be the fourth highest on record, Swiss Re said.
The deadly Camp and Woolsey wildfires in California, which killed 85 people and destroyed more than 20,000 buildings, will result in claims for Swiss Re of about $375 million, it said, while the company's estimate for Typhoons Jebi and Trami in Asia increased by $320 million in the period.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 01:21AM ET</span>",No clear path for California as massive PG&E utility nears bankruptcy,"By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - PG&E Corp's announcement that it will file for bankruptcy, citing massive potential liability from deadly wildfires, puts California politicians in quandary, whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state's largest private utility to fail.
Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&E (N:PCG) stay solvent, but no decisions had been made. 
And lawmakers in the state legislature, who last year approved a bill making it easier for PG&E to bill ratepayers for the costs of wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017, said that there was less support this year for extending additional financial assistance to the company.
""We would like to see it (bankruptcy) avoided, but we are not naive,"" Newsom said. ""I'm cognizant of the taxpayers, and I'm cognizant of the ratepayers, and I'm absolutely cognizant of those who lost everything.""
PG&E's announcement on Monday that it intends to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as early as this month, citing potential liability exceeding $30 billion due to wildfires, came a day after its chief executive officer, Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB), was ousted from her post.
PG&E, which ranks as the largest U.S. power utility by number of customers, supplies electricity to 40 percent of Californians. The state, Newsom said, is determined to keep service running to those customers.
But the utility's power equipment has been linked to the ignition of more than a dozen wildfires in the past two years, and is a suspected cause of the deadliest fire in state history, which swept through the town of Paradise in November, killing 86 people and destroying 90 percent of homes and businesses there.
Mark Toney, executive director of consumer advocate group the Utility Reform Network, said the atmosphere had cooled considerably toward PG&E in recent months, making a bailout politically more difficult for lawmakers.
""PG&E is going to have a much harder time because it doesn’t appear that they’ve learned any lessons,"" Toney said.
MIXED SIGNALS
The legislature and the governor could decide to allow PG&E to pass along the costs associated with victim lawsuits and other fire losses to ratepayers, as they did last year for a series of deadly northern California blazes in 2017.
Such legislation would also let utilities shift some future fire-related costs to consumers so long as regulators find no negligence on the companies' part. 
But state lawmakers have given mixed signals about what they might do about liability stemming from the deadly Camp Fire of November 2018 that incinerated most of Paradise. 
Legislators representing areas devastated by wildfires have opposed any bailout for PG&E, saying its investors should absorb the costs - even if that means the company is bankrupted.
PG&E's safety record has come under sharp scrutiny before.
State Senator Jerry Hill, whose district includes the site of the deadly 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion determined to have been caused by PG&E's criminal negligence said support for the utility was softer this year.

""I think there's less chance, less thought of a bailout this year than we saw last year, certainly,"" said Hill, who has the names of the nine people killed in the San Bruno blast framed in his office.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",Eyes on Newcrest as gold dealmaking heats up,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Two recent large M&A deals in the gold sector have prompted speculation that Newcrest Mining (AX:NCM),  Kinross Gold Corp  (TO:K) and  B2Gold Corp  (TO:BTO) may be among the next gold companies to combine with a rival, bankers and analysts said.
On Monday,  Newmont Mining  (N:NEM) announced a $10 billion takeover of  Goldcorp  Inc (TO:G), close on the heels of Barrick Gold's (TO:ABX) purchase of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS).
Deal-making had largely been dormant in the gold sector in recent years, as companies focused on cutting costs amid investor criticism of inadequate management of capital. But the need to bolster shrinking gold reserves to boost growth and take advantage of rising gold prices are now providing the impetus for consolidation.
""There are potential benefits to consolidation and gold miners that can generate returns above cost of capital will likely be rewarded over time,"" Chris LaFemina, an equity analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note on Monday. 
Gold producers who have good assets but face stagnant growth are seeking to partner with well-run companies, according to bankers and analysts. 
Eyes are on Australia's Newcrest, capitalized at around 18 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion), a banker close to the Newmont-Goldcorp deal said.
A buyout of a North American miner could improve Newcrest's valuation by offering a dual listing, said Andy Forster, portfolio manager at Argo Investments in Sydney.
""They have got some organic growth, but ... being listed out here they are probably overlooked a little bit by North American (investors).""
Brenton Saunders, an analyst with Sydney-based fund manager Pendal Group, said Newcrest was more likely a buyer than a target. 
""My sense is they want to buy something - not small, but manageable - more of a single asset somewhere in the Americas."" 
Newcrest spokesman Chris Maitland told Reuters, ""If we can see an asset where we can ... use one of our competitive advantages to increase the value of that asset, that's how we'd approach M&A.""
Newcrest, which has expertise in a type of mining called blockcaving, is vying with BHP Group (AX:BHP) (L:BHPB) as major stakeholders in Ecuador's SolGold (L:SOLG).
TIE-UP POTENTIAL 
Canadian miner Kinross and AngloGold Ashanti (J:ANGJ), based in South Africa, are among the gold producers that could combine with other companies, analysts and bankers said. 
""If you do a list of who has high-cost assets, those are the guys who have to make deals,"" another person close to the Newmont-Goldcorp deal said.
Kinross did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AngloGold Ashanti could not be reached outside business hours.
Kinross needs to focus on replacing depleted assets, and would likely hone in on North America if it were to do a deal, analysts at Scotiabank wrote in November.
Vancouver-based B2Gold, which has operations in Africa, South America and the Philippines, could be a target because of its strong growth profile, said sector watchers, including PI Financial's Chris Thompson, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. 
B2Gold did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The acquirer would likely be a company that has operational expertise in the jurisdictions B2Gold operates in, particularly West Africa, which offers the best growth prospects for the company, Thompson said.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 09:23PM ET</span>",Global auto leaders urge Trump administration to end trade turmoil,"By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto executives gathered in Detroit on Monday called on the Trump administration and Congress to resolve trade disputes, and end the government shutdown, saying political uncertainty is costing the industry. 
U.S. trade officials are negotiating a new deal with China in hopes of avoiding new tariffs, while a new regional trade agreement with Canada and Mexico still needs congressional approval. Automakers producing vehicles in the United States are contending with U.S. steel and aluminum prices driven higher by Trump administration tariffs.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) Chief Executive Mike Manley told reporters at the Detroit auto show on Monday that U.S. metals tariffs will raise the automaker's 2019 costs by $300 million to $350 million, or about $135 to $160 a vehicle, based on the automaker's 2018 U.S. sales. 
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) executive vice president for North American sales, Bob Carter, said the company has had to raise prices three times because of higher tariff costs - even though 96 percent of steel in Toyota U.S. vehicles is from U.S. steel plants. The tariffs boosted industry vehicles prices by about $600 on average, he estimated.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are also taking financial hits from the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
""Those are headwinds,"" GM President Mark Reuss told Reuters. ""It's our job to run the business to offset those headwinds.""
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra last Friday promised investors the company would boost 2019 profit despite tariff-related costs and investments in electric vehicles. She stuck to her plans to target five North American factories for closure and cut nearly 15,000 jobs overall.
About one-quarter of federal government operations have been shut down by a lack of funding since Dec. 22 after President Donald Trump demanded $5.7 billion this year from Congress for building a security wall on the southwest U.S. border.
Manley said the U.S. government shutdown is holding up certification of one of the company's new heavy duty pickup truck models. Those vehicles are among the company's most profitable products.
""The earlier it can be resolved, clearly the better,"" he said.
Concern in the auto industry about the uncertainty created by Trump's efforts to revamp trade and environmental policies is weighing more heavily as forecasters call for a slowdown in vehicle demand in the United States and China during 2019.
""There's a lot of balls in the air right now that are unresolved,"" Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters on the sidelines of the auto show. ""Certainty is something we really desire because of our product lead times. We don't have that right now.""
Ford said the automaker feels its opinions are being heard by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, but he has no idea when the various issues will be resolved.
U.S.-China trade tensions have forced Chinese automaker GAC to delay its planned entry to the U.S. market, Wang Qiujing, head of GAC's (SS:601238) research and development center, told Reuters on Monday. ""We have postponed our launch until the first half of 2020,"" he said, adding that the timing will depend on the outcome of U.S.-China trade negotiations. If the current 25 percent U.S. tariff on Chinese-made vehicles continues, ""the impact will be very significant,"" he said.
GAC has a large display at the Detroit auto show, and is hiring engineers and designers at three U.S. locations, including a new technical office in Detroit expected to employ about 30 people, Wang said.
Auto executives have welcomed the conclusion of a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, as the industry seeks certainty for rules that will govern automakers' long-term investment decisions in the region. 
In the interest of greater certainty, they would like to see the U.S. Congress decide quickly on the updated agreement's fate.
""We just need it resolved,"" said Brian Smith, chief operating officer for  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) in North America, who added that the automaker needs clarity so it can adjust its supply chain as necessary. ""It's been going on way too long.""
U.S. officials are weighing so-called Section 232 national security tariffs on imported vehicles. That tariff would not hit U.S.-made models, but some analysts warn it could trigger a sales slump as prices for European and Asian-made models jump.
""The decline in volumes could be larger than a recession would produce,"" Jonathan Smoke, an economist with auto market information company Cox Automotive, said during a briefing on Sunday.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess on Monday announced the German automaker would invest $800 million in its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant and add 1,000 jobs to build electric vehicles as it faces pressure from the Trump administration.
VW is worried the Trump administration will move ahead with new tariffs and hopes the new investments will help the German automaker avoid them. ""We have strongly been encouraged to invest more, which we will do,"" said Diess, who met with Trump last month.

China’s Shanghai Composite gained 1% while the Shenzhen Component also traded 1.3% higher by 9:11 PM ET (02:11 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.9%.
The gain in Chinese stocks came after reports that Beijing vowed tax cuts on a larger scale to help support its slowing economy.

“There are two macro events that continue to weigh on market perspective,” Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Asset Management, said in an interview.
“The first is where is global growth heading next, and weak Chinese trade data would suggest that global growth is certainly not bottomed as of yet. And the second issue is the persistence of the U.S. government shutdown and how that muddies our perspective about what happens next.”

961,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",PG&E Bailout Hopes Are Crushed With California Showing Little Interest,"(Bloomberg) -- For days, California Governor Gavin Newsom and lawmakers deflected questions about what they’d do to keep the state’s largest utility, PG&E Corp., from going under. On Monday, their response became clear: Not much -- at least not until the power giant has actually gone bankrupt.
Once the San Francisco-based company has made a Chapter 11 filing -- in what’s likely to be one of the largest utility bankruptcies of all time -- California can jump into the case as a party and wield its power as one of the few entities that must sign off on the company’s final plan to emerge. That leaves room for Newsom to still carry heavy weight in the outcome.
The new Democratic governor made at least one thing clear in his statement Monday: He plans to keep California on track to “make progress toward our climate goals” even as PG&E takes steps to address its $30 billion in potential wildfire liabilities.
The filing, viewed by some as the worst outcome, may actually help California decide what type of utility is right for a state with an ever-increasing risk of multibillion-dollar wildfires, according to Severin Borenstein, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Options such as breaking up the utility giant or turning it into government-owned entities are likely to be hashed out in concert with the bankruptcy proceeding, he said.
“It will accelerate the discussion that was being had before bankruptcy, which is what is the appropriate structure of utilities given the increased wildfire risk?” Borenstein said in an interview. “If we are going to have investor-owned utilities, how do we deal with the fact that they may face multibillion liabilities?”
Deteriorating Finances
Newsom and other lawmakers showed little interest in bailing out the beleaguered company after it said it plans to file for bankruptcy on or around Jan. 29. The company determined a bankruptcy filing was “the only viable option” to deal with its deteriorating finances after discussions with state officials, Steven Malnight, senior vice president of energy supply and policy at PG&E’s utility unit, said in an interview.
A bankruptcy reorganization would allow PG&E to operate and keep the lights on as a court considers a restructuring that could save it.
And it would do something else. “It diversifies the responsibility for what plays out,” said Kit Konolige, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
“So far, I would say the politicians have been very successful to avoid being the bad guy,” he said. “Clearly the one in the barrel is the utility. What politician is going to step up and say ‘I want to save PG&E?’”
At the moment, not many. It’s unlikely, though, that the pressure will be off Newsom and the legislature to act. Chapter 11 gives creditors, the company and other stakeholders room to negotiate and the state is surely one of those, said Stephen Nielander, adjunct lecturer at San Diego State University.
“You’re really talking about a vital interest asset,” Nielander said. The state has “a vested interest in our citizens being covered and protected. Does that get them a seat at the table? It’s hard to imagine that they’re not.”
It may also pave the way for change in California’s relationship with its power companies. Betty Yee, the state’s controller, said PG&E’s move “underscores the reality that the state cannot regulate utilities as we have for the last 100 years.”
“We need to comprehensively assess our electricity infrastructure and create solutions that ensure reliable service, the utmost safety and rigorous ratepayer protections to mitigate further impacts on our state’s economy,” Yee said in a Twitter post.
The California Public Utilities Commission said it was closely monitoring PG&E, as are the governor’s office and state agencies. The commission would have to sign off on any rate increases or changes required to help the company exit a bankruptcy so would be part of any proceedings.
‘Sufficient Resources’
“At this point, PG&E has sufficient resources to continue to safely meet its core responsibilities and obligations,” Terrie Prosper, a CPUC spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.PG&E employs 20,000 people and provides power to more than 15 million. Its liabilities could grow from wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has blamed 17 of the 2017 blazes in part on company power lines and other equipment.
Its stock has tanked, and it has little left in the bank -- $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Friday. PG&E has said it doesn’t intend to make an interest payment of about $21.6 million due Tuesday on 5.4 percent senior notes due in 2040.
“There isn’t a lot of time left,” said Shahriar Pourreza, a Guggenheim analyst. “You’re talking six months until you actually get into a liquidity crunch.”
Even if they wanted to, Newsom and legislators might simply be unable to do anything in time.
“The high degree of controversy and public outcry stemming from wildfire damages and perceived blame assigned to PG&E likely creates headwinds in the legislative process,” the research firm ClearView Energy Partners LLC said in a report Monday. “The 15-day notice offers a very short runway for lawmakers to act.”
PG&E on Sunday started searching for a new chief executive officer after Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB), 57, quit; general counsel John Simon will take the helm in the meantime.
Bonds that traded above face value about two months ago posted steep drops. The stock fell 52 percent to $8.38 a share New York, its biggest one-day drop since 1980. Shares are down more than 80 percent since the Camp Fire, the deadliest blaze in state history, broke out Nov. 8.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 08:36PM ET</span>",PG&E prepares bankruptcy filing after California wildfires,"By Liana B. Baker, Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG), owner of the biggest U.S. power utility by customers, said on Monday it is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as soon as this month amid pressure from potentially crushing liabilities linked to California's catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires, the company said.
The most recent fire last November killed at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive blaze in California history. 
Its shares plunged 52 percent on Monday to $8.38, giving it a market capitalization of less than $4.5 billion. The stock is down more than 80 percent from late 2017, before wildfires devastated PG&E's service areas. Bond prices also fell sharply on Monday.
PG&E's chief executive officer was replaced on Sunday by General Counsel John Simon on an interim basis.
San Francisco-based PG&E is working on lining up roughly $5.5 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing to help operations during bankruptcy proceedings. 
The utility said the bankruptcy process would not affect electric or natural gas services for customers. Company advisers expect that it may take up to two years to emerge from bankruptcy.
In theory, California politicians could avert PG&E's bankruptcy with legislative action. Last year, the state approved a law helping utilities recoup costs from fires in 2017, but not blazes in 2018. 
Lawmakers and regulators may both be constrained in how much more they can help PG&E, at least by allowing it to further raise electricity rates.
California's average rate is 16 cents per kilowatt hour, while those in neighboring Oregon and in Washington state are about half as much, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provided by energy consulting firm McCullough Research. The U.S. average is 10 cents per kilowatt hour.
'SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY'
PG&E said in a securities filing it could potentially raise more money and avoid seeking bankruptcy protection, but argued such a move would be complex, uncertain and expensive.
Moody's and Standard & Poor's recently cut PG&E's credit rating into junk territory, citing concerns about wildfire liabilities. 
On Monday, Moody's and S&P cut PG&E's ratings again and Fitch downgraded the California power company and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit to junk.
A bankruptcy filing could help the company deal with such fundamental problems as the prospect of continually being exposed to financial fallout from future wildfires, the company said. Many PG&E customers live near dry forests where rain has become increasingly rare - conditions for potential future blazes. 
PG&E's regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission, began in late December to investigate whether the company should make significant structural changes, including becoming owned by the state or splitting up its businesses. 
The company said it was looking for new members for its board of directors with safety experience.
PG&E said it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the Camp Fire that swept through the California mountain community of Paradise last November. 
PG&E's liabilities from that fire could be catastrophic if authorities determine its equipment caused the blazes. Under California law, utilities are exposed to liability from wildfires regardless of their negligence. The company decided to prepare to file for bankruptcy in part to address that issue, known as ""inverse condemnation.""
In a regulatory filing, it questioned whether it could continue to operate in the years ahead as a so-called investor-owned utility by being exposed to that risk. Investors might avoid the company if questions around that risk remain unanswered. 
A federal judge last week proposed restricting PG&E from using power lines deemed unsafe during high winds in this year's fire season. 
Energy companies that supply PG&E could be hit by its bankruptcy. One of the most exposed is  Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI), the second-largest North American pipeline operator, analysts said.
PG&E plans to seek court protection from creditors around Jan. 29, the company said. It alerted employees on Monday in order to comply with California law.
The company's board ousted CEO Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB) and decided to undergo a restructuring at a meeting over the weekend in San Francisco, according to a source familiar with the matter. Williams had served as CEO since March 2017, before the fatal blazes.

PG&E, which drew down remaining amounts on credit lines totaling $3.3 billion in November, had about $1.5 billion of liquidity as of Friday.

The disclosure raises tough questions for new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who have vowed to end years of graft involving the oil company and Brazil's political class. 
Nominee John Forman was fined 338,500 reais ($91,540) by the CVM in 2016 for insider trading, according to the documents seen by Reuters. The news was first reported by newspaper Valor Economico, which said the sentence did not bar him from sitting on the boards of public companies.
Forman and Petrobras, as the company is known, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Forman, who has appealed the ruling unsuccessfully so far, has not paid the fine. In a statement, the CVM said it ""would adopt the necessary measures to receive payment of the outstanding amount.""
Forman, a former director of national oil regulator ANP, is one of three nominees that the government wants to sit on the board of the oil firm. The nominations come amid accusations that Castello Branco has been pushing to oust other board members.
Forman was fined for the sale of shares in HRT Participações em Petróleo, where he used to work. The CVM found that Forman was involved in moving shares ahead of the publication of a regulatory filing about a development in an oil exploration project in Namibia. 
Forman told Valor that the dispute with CVM had been settled, but did not give any further details. He confirmed to the paper that he had not paid the fine.

964,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Japanese Yen Coiled Tight, Big Breakout Likely","Bad news from Chinese trade report may push investors into safe haven currencies, notes Matt Weller.
Traders’ risk appetites are actually holding up relatively well today, despite abysmal trade Chinese trade figures overnight (exports -4.4%, imports -7.6%), the likelihood of a failed vote on UK PM May’s Brexit deal tomorrow, an inauspicious start to Q4 earnings season, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.
Such concerns are boosting traditional “safe haven” currencies like the Swiss franc (USD/CHF) and Japanese yen (USD/JPY), but the moves so far today are relatively subdued. USD/JPY, for example, briefly peeked below 108.00 early in today’s European session, but rates have recovered back to trade in the 108.25 area as of writing. Since the early-January flash crash, the pair has been consolidating within a tight symmetrical triangle pattern; for the uninitiated, or the uninitiated, this pattern is analogous to a person compressing a coiled spring: as the range continues to contract, energy builds up within the spring. When one of the pressure points is eventually removed, the spring will explode in that direction.
While it’s notoriously difficult to predict the direction of a symmetrical triangle breakout in advance, analysts will typically defer to the dominant trend heading into the formation, which in this case was unequivocally down (see chart below). If we see that scenario play out, a break below last week’s low near 107.75 would open the door for a continuation down toward 107.00, 106.00, or even the flash crash panic lows near 105.00 in time.
Source: TradingView, FOREX.com
On the other hand, a bullish break above the highs near 109.00 could signal that a near-term bottom is in (especially in accompanied by a thaw in U.S.-China trade relations or an end to the U.S. government shutdown), clearing the way for a recovery toward previous support around 110.00 or higher in the coming days."
965,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds Could Drive S&P Gains,"The buy-to-open put/call ratio volume on major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indicates that Hedge Funds may be getting long the market reports Todd Salamone.
 Bulls were treated to another round of buying last week, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed governors reiterated that they can be patient evaluating data and raising rates. The fact that the S&P 500 Index (SPX) took out its 2018 lows gives more credence to a V-rally. 
That said, after moving above the February 2018 daily closing low of 2,581 on Wednesday, the SPX didn't make much headway. Profit-taking may have slowed the momentum, as the SPX climbed to the 2,586 area, 10% above the Christmas Eve closing low of 2,351. The good news for bulls is that the SPX has now closed five consecutive days above its closes on Dec. 18-19, when the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates. Typically, if a pullback occurs immediately after a rate increase, such Fed-day closing levels will act as short-term resistance. Therefore, the area between 2,506-2,546 remains a first line of defense for bulls in the short term.
The rally has continued following an important weekly close for longer-term investors above the SPX's 160-week moving average in late December, after a beginning-of-the-week break of this trendline on Christmas Eve. The low on Christmas Eve occurred at the SPX's 200-week moving average, which is another trendline we'll focus on if the lows are retested in the coming weeks or months. We noticed that this trendline marked the exact lows in 1987, February 2016, and December 2018, making it worthwhile to have on your radar, particularly during periods of market distress like December. Just as the 160-week moving average is approximately a three-year moving average that we have focused on for weekly closes, the 200-week moving average is a round-number moving average that approximates a four-year moving average.
SPX resistance at 2,600 could take on more importance this week, with standard January options due to expire. Because of this, we turn to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY (NYSE:SPY)) January open interest configuration, where there is a huge amount open interest at the 260 strike, which is equivalent to SPX 2,600. Buying and selling related to this open interest could create a speed bump through Friday's expiration, much like the week-long speed bump that occurred around the 250 strike from the end of December into the first week of January. 
A delta-hedge sell-off, like we saw in December, is unlikely given how far out-of-the-money the major put open interest is coming into expiration week. 
If we look beyond January expiration, there are multiple resistance levels overhead with which the SPX must overcome if it continues to make its way higher. A major area to watch is between 2,650 and 2,690 (through this Friday), which represents potential trendline resistance when connecting the Oct. 3 peak with the Dec. 3 peak (you can see this trendline on the SPX chart above). Levels connected with this trendline move lower as time passes, which is why I gave a wide range to monitor beginning with this week into early February.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) action could give us a clue as to whether the next move will be a retest of the low or a continuation rally from the December bottom. The VIX comes into the week situated between half its December closing high at 18.03, but below half its 2018 closing high at 18.66 and double its 2018 closing low at 18.44. In other words, this area between 18.03 and 18.66 is significant relative to important closing highs and lows since January 2018. A daily close below 18.03 could indicate lower volatility ahead, combined with further strength in equities. 
Unfortunately, with the government shutdown, the net positions of VIX futures large speculators has not been reported by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC). As of the last report date, Dec. 18, this group, which is usually wrong at major turning points in volatility, was in a rare net long position. This favors the bulls, especially after the SPX's bounce from long-term moving average support around the time of the position update.
Finally, I’ll leave you with what appears to be potentially good news for bulls. As the market rallied from the Christmas Eve closing low, it looks like shorts indeed built up positions, but it was not a very big buildup, according to short interest data as of Jan. 1, 2019, that we compiled on SPX components. The fact the SPX rallied during this build is also encouraging, as it is indicative of money coming off the sidelines that was able to overcome the shorting activity, and many of the freshly added shorts are now in a losing position, which might generate covering.
There is still a risk to bulls that the shorts are looking for higher levels to unleash their fury. But it appears that the group that might be most prone to building a short position, hedge funds, may be looking to build long positions instead. For example, look at the chart below that quantifies buy-to-open put and call volume on major exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the SPY, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and tech-laden Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ). 
Since some hedge funds use these ETFs as hedging vehicles, the buy-to-open put/call volume ratio tends to decline because they are either liquidating long positions (buying fewer puts as a hedge) or buying more calls relative to puts as they build short positions. The ratio rolled over prior to the most recent setback, as put buying plunged (indicative of hedge funds liquidating long positions). 
The ratio recently bottomed at a multi-year low and is now ticking higher, due to put demand growing again. When the buy-to-open put/call volume ratio was this low in early 2014 and began moving higher, it was a major buying opportunity, as the hedge funds were likely in accumulation mode, building long positions from a historically low exposure level. All indications are these funds have very low stock exposure, and continued accumulation from this crowd could drive the SPX through resistance."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An anonymous trader caused a stir in the U.S. equity options market on Monday with a massive bet that recalled Warren Buffett's famous wager on global stocks more than a decade ago.
The trader sold 19,000 put options on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) obligating him or her to buy the market benchmark at 2,100 on Dec. 18, 2020, data from New York-based options analytics firm Trade alert showed.
As long as the index doesn't drop more than 22 percent from its current level of 2,582 by that date, the bet will earn the trader roughly $175 million in premiums.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) sold billions of dollars in stock index options between 2004 and 2008, betting that markets would rise over the next 15 to 20 years. Although the trades were made anonymously, they were eventually disclosed in regulatory filings. 
Berkshire has taken in more than $4 billion in premiums on the options. The holding company has other contracts that have not expired, including a final tranche that will settle in 2026. 
While Monday's sale was nowhere near as large as Buffett's, the trader could still lose more than half a billion dollars if stocks turn sour over the next couple of years. 
For example, if the S&P 500 loses 34 percent of its value by Dec. 18, 2020, the trader will rack up a loss of about $558 million, according to a Refinitiv analysis.
The market has been volatile in recent months, with the S&P finishing 2018 nearly 20 percent lower than its record high in September, although it has recovered half that ground since.

Another lot of about 3,600 of the same puts traded on Monday, helping boost the total number of the contracts to about 24,000 on the day. Some 5,500 of the contracts also changed hands on Friday, according to Trade Alert data.
Some market participants guessed the trader was likely hedging against another position rather than betting outright that stocks will rise.
""The natural sellers of long-term downside puts are structured products desks at banks, who are hedging exposure they get from retail clients who buy structured notes that have embedded short put options,"" Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors in San Francisco, said on Twitter.

""That would be my default guess on this.""

984,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",FCA reviewing Italy plan after new taxes for polluting cars,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) is reviewing its investment plan for Italy after the country approved taxes on the purchase of larger gasoline and diesel cars, Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said on Monday. 
The carmaker said in late November it would spend more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) on new models and engines in Italy over the next three years to try to make better use of factories and boost jobs and margins.
In December, however, Italy approved measures to offer subsidies of up to 6,000 euros to buyers of new low-emission vehicles while introducing taxes on the larger gasoline and diesel cars.
""It certainly means it needs to be reviewed again. It's being reviewed at this moment,"" Manley told journalists on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. ""Until that review is finished I can't comment any further.""
FCA's Italian plans were intended to deliver on a strategy outlined by late boss Sergio Marchionne in June, when he committed to keep converting Italian plants to churn out higher-margin Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles, to protect jobs and lift profit.
Manley said tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on steel and aluminum imports would add between $300 million and $350 million in extra costs for FCA in 2019.
He said the partial U.S. government shutdown over spending for a wall sought by Republican Trump on the U.S.-Mexican border has delayed final certification of one of FCA's heavy-duty pickup trucks. 
Pickup trucks are the one of most profitable segments in the auto industry and are a major profit driver for FCA as it battles for market share against General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
""So I am concerned, clearly. Very concerned,"" Manley said.
""If it (the shutdown) continues it will have an impact on the launch of heavy duty.""
""The earlier it can be resolved, clearly the better,"" he added.
Manley, who took the helm at the world's seventh-largest carmaker last year after Marchionne's sudden death, also said that FCA's robotics business, Comau, and castings unit, Teksid, were not for sale at the moment. 
""I'm focused on building value in those businesses. If I'm able to do that, that's going to give me options in the future,"" he said. 
FCA last year agreed to sell its biggest parts maker, Magneti Marelli, to Japan's Calsonic Kansei - owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) - for 6.2 billion euros.
That sparked renewed speculation that the smaller Comau and Teksid businesses could also go, especially after attracting interest from potential buyers in the past. 
""One thing I learned in 2018: you should never say never,"" Manley said. ""Those businesses have value, there have been people that have talked to us about those businesses and I’ve been interested to hear what they have to say.""

The fall was only partly offset by a rise in financials, which profited from  Citigroup  's solid fourth-quarter earnings report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36%, but closed well above its session lows of 23,765.24. The S&P 500 lost 0.59%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.94%.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with a mixed report as earnings beat, while revenue missed consensus estimates, sending its shares 4% higher.
The mixed report from Citigroup did little to deter market participants, as investors viewed the recent sell off as ""perhaps being overdone given the overall quality in the Citigroup report,"" according to Briefing.com.
The surge in Citigroup sparked a wave of buys in other banking stocks as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) - both of which are slated to release quarterly earnings on Tuesday - ended the day higher.
Financials gained 1%, but gains in the broader market were stifled somewhat by falling tech stocks after weaker trade data from China raised concerns about slowing global growth.
Among FANG stocks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) fell 1%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.5% as analysts called on the iPhone maker to cut prices of its latest smartphones in China and consider ""significant"" content acquisitions to drive services growth in 2019.
""Apple needs to aggressively cut prices in China on the iPhone XR as well as consider significant content acquisitions to drive services over the coming years,"" Wedbush said in a note to clients.
Apple was also pressured by fresh signs of waning iPhone demand after its supplier Dialog Semiconductor reported early revenue results at the low end of the expected range.
Energy names, meanwhile, struggled to advance after U.S. oil prices slipped 2.1% as concerns over slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, sparked fresh worries about a slowdown in demand.
In corporate news, Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG) slumped 52% after the utility said it will file for bankruptcy and its chief executive officer will step down.
The subdued start to the week for US stocks comes as analysts suggested there's more room for growth as the economy is better positioned than its global peers to weather storms either internally or beyond its borders.
""We believe this strategic overweight [to U.S. stocks] is still warranted. While the U.S. is not immune to developments beyond its borders, the country is better positioned to weather future storms than virtually any other. It is also sufficiently resilient to absorb uncertainty from within,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>","China worries weigh on Wall Street, earnings expectations fall","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Monday as an unexpected drop in China's exports reignited worries of a global economic slowdown and prompted caution among investors as the corporate earnings season kicked off.
Data showed that China's exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December and imports also contracted. The drop pointed to further weakening of the world's second-largest economy and faltering global demand.
Chipmakers, which get a sizable portion of their revenue from China, took a hit, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 1.6 percent. The technology sector's (SPLRCT) 0.9 percent fall was the biggest drag on the S&P 500.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 86.11 points, or 0.36 percent, to 23,909.84, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 13.65 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,582.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 65.56 points, or 0.94 percent, to 6,905.92. 
As worries over global growth have mounted, lofty expectations for U.S. corporate growth have subsided. Analysts now estimate that S&P 500 earnings will grow 14.3 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter, whereas in October they forecast a 20.1-percent jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""It will be a big thing to see if the Chinese slowdown is real, or if it is an excuse for some companies not to hit the high growth seen last quarter,"" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital in San Francisco. ""If things are really slowing down, you'll start to see it show up this quarter in earnings.""
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) had pointed to slowing demand in China when it cut its revenue forecast on Jan. 2.
However, earnings season began on a positive note as  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) beat profit estimates. The bank's shares rose 4.0 percent and bolstered the S&P financial sector (SPSY), which rose 0.7 percent.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) are set to report earnings on Tuesday.
Adding to the downbeat mood on Monday, the partial government shutdown entered its 24th day, making it the longest shuttering of federal agencies in U.S. history.
Shares of PG&E Corp (N:PCG) plunged 52.4 percent after the U.S. power utility said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for all of its businesses.
Despite Monday's drop, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 10 percent from its Christmas Eve low as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks and expectations that the Fed will slow its pace of interest-rate hikes have driven a recent stock rally.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 15 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.8 billion shares, compared to the 8.83 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 02:37PM ET</span>",'Zero coordination': Mexico's war on fuel theft risks economic chaos,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Conceived as a bold plan to attack corruption, a crackdown by Mexico's new president on rampant fuel theft has turned into a battle to prevent economic chaos after state governments, businesses and consumers were caught out by the decision.
Eager to purge a prominent stain on Mexico's reputation, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Dec. 27 unveiled a plan to increase military protection of oil installations and began cutting supply from pipelines that have been bled for years by thieves.
So far, the result has been more than a week of severe fuel shortages, shuttered gas stations and lines of motorists snaking around city blocks waiting hours to fill their tanks. 
The 65-year-old leftist, who took office on Dec. 1, will score a major victory if he can eradicate the parallel fuel distribution network which the government says has been run largely with the connivance of corrupt employees inside state oil firm Pemex [PEMX.UL]. Last year alone, the theft was worth $3 billion, according to government figures.
But the pipeline shutdowns, which Lopez Obrador says were drawn up in his early morning security cabinet meetings during December, blindsided Mexicans when gas stations started to run dry in some of the country's largest cities.
Officials in three affected states told Reuters they were not warned in advance about the supply cuts.
""There was zero coordination,"" said Alejandro Guzman, head of economic development in the government of Jalisco, home to the country's second-biggest city, Guadalajara. ""We started to notice when the gas stations began closing.""
He estimated only a quarter of gas stations in the western half of Guadalajara had fuel during the past week. Still, once the shortages became apparent, Pemex's new management started to work well with the state to try to address the problem, he said.
The government spent most of its regular news conference on Monday morning discussing the fuel plan. Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero said sales were recovering in affected areas.
""We'll be back to normal soon,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Government officials said three senior Pemex executives in charge of pipelines were under investigation over the fuel thefts, and that more than a dozen people had had their bank accounts blocked. None of the suspects were named.
The haphazard roll-out of the plan, in which millions of liters of fuel are delivered each day by tanker truck instead of by pipeline, is a new test of investor confidence in Lopez Obrador, who rocked markets by cancelling a partly-built $13 billion airport five weeks before taking office.
A successful crackdown on theft would be welcome news for Pemex, which as the most indebted oil firm in Latin America faces the threat of a credit rating downgrade. For now, however, Pemex is absorbing the higher cost of moving fuel by road.
If distribution problems persist, industry groups say manufacturing facilities like auto plants could soon idle. The central bank has warned that fuel bottlenecks could stoke inflation and crimp growth in an already slowing economy.
Already, a new black market is emerging for gasoline resold at a premium by people willing to spend the time standing in line. Usually bustling food markets in Mexico City have quietened down as shoppers and suppliers stay home to conserve fuel.
OWNING THE CRISIS
Facing reporters every weekday at 7 a.m., Lopez Obrador has taken ownership of the theft crackdown. But his officials have not always agreed on how quickly the crunch will be resolved.
Calling it the ""first real domestic crisis"" of the new administration, Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister, said the fuel controversy had added to previous question marks about Lopez Obrador's style of governing.
""There's not enough communication and not enough coherence in the strategy,"" said Rozental, a longtime diplomat turned business consultant.
Given the complexity and cost of protecting thousands of miles of pipeline, some analysts believe Lopez Obrador will have to back down before the theft is fully under control. He says he will only reopen the pipelines when they are secured.
Polls suggest Lopez Obrador's base still has his back.
A Jan. 9-11 survey of 1,000 voters by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky said 50 percent backed his plan, while some 40 percent wanted fuel supply returned to normal immediately. Lopez Obrador won office with just over 53 percent of the vote.
Some of the worst shortages have been in opposition-run states. In one, the carmaking hub of Guanajuato, governor Diego Sinhue told local radio all but 7 of nearly 200 gas stations in Leon, the biggest city, were closed at one point.
Once a largely peaceful region, annual murders in Guanajuato leapt more than ten-fold between 2007 and last year to over 2,300, spurred by turf wars between gangs battling over the pipelines that crisscross the central state.
So the government's decision to go after the fuel thieves was welcome, said Jose Arturo Sanchez, head of the Leon chapter of Mexico's CCE business lobby. But the planning that left drivers stranded, he said, was ""totally irresponsible.""
""They didn't consider the consequences,"" he said. ""In the 50 years I've lived in Leon, there's been nothing like it.""
As with Jalisco, Sinhue said Guanajuato was not warned by the federal government the pipelines would be closed.

Nor was the city of Queretaro, capital of the neighboring state of the same name, mayor Luis Bernardo Nava told Reuters.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>",Nissan CEO calls for Renault board to review Ghosn findings,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan (T:7201) expects alliance partner Renault's (PA:RENA) board to back its ousting of Chairman Carlos Ghosn once it sees evidence from the Japanese carmaker's investigation, Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said in a Monday newspaper interview.
Nissan understands that findings it provided to  Renault  lawyers more than a month ago have still not been shared in full with the Renault board, Saikawa told France's Les Echos.
""All that I ask is that the directors of Renault should have access to the full dossier,"" Saikawa said. ""I think that once that's the case, they will draw the same conclusions as we did.""
Ghosn's November arrest in Japan and dismissal by Nissan have deepened tensions with its French parent Renault - which has so far maintained Ghosn in office as chairman and CEO, citing the presumption of innocence.
A spokesman for Renault, which has said judicial confidentiality requires tight restrictions on access to Nissan's findings even by its own board members, did not return calls and messages seeking comment.
Ghosn has been charged over allegations that he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted. 
Both men deny that the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Saikawa's interview was published ahead of an expected court hearing in Japan on Tuesday, at which Ghosn's lawyers are to present a request for his release on bail.
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, will support the decision to keep Ghosn at its helm unless it becomes clear he will be ""chronically incapacitated"" by the Japanese investigation, officials said on Monday.
Tuesday is likely to see ""important developments"" in relation to that question, one French official said.
OLIVE BRANCH
Saikawa extended an olive branch to Renault and its state shareholder, while also dismissing French speculation that the scandal had been engineered by Nissan to oust Ghosn and end Renault's control.
""It's absurd and I don't understand how anyone can believe such a scenario for a second,"" he said. ""Look at the evidence; it's serious.""
While the presumption of innocence must be observed in criminal matters, Saikawa added, the Nissan board's unanimous decision to dismiss Ghosn was grounded in ethical considerations and ""the facts brought to light"".
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent holding in the French carmaker carries no voting rights.
Saikawa also appeared to soften his own earlier calls for changes to guarantee Nissan more autonomy and potentially restore its voting rights - which had rung alarm bells in Paris.
While investors do want to see the alliance structure evolve, Saikawa said, ""that is really not the current priority.""

""The important thing today is to stabilize things and work together trustingly - not to know whether Nissan should have voting rights in Renault,"" he added in the interview.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",U.S. healthcare stocks seen maintaining momentum after strong 2018,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the rare market bright spots last year, the U.S. healthcare sector remains a Wall Street darling despite a slow start to 2019. 
As 2019 begins, healthcare (SPXHC) is the most favored of the 11 main S&P 500 sectors, according to a Reuters review of ratings from 13 large Wall Street research firms, which recommend how to weigh those groups in investment portfolios.
Healthcare shares overall rose 4.7 percent last year, one of only two S&P 500 sectors, along with utilities, to post positive returns in 2018 as the benchmark index fell 6.2 percent. 
Proponents cite the healthcare sector's reasonable valuations, strong balance sheets and dividend payments among many companies, as well as the group's upbeat outlook for earnings, which are less susceptible to economic cycles than other businesses.
If economic growth is slowing, some investors are wary of being too invested in cyclical sectors that thrive during an upswing, but do not want to be too defensive either.
“We are trying to find things that skirt both of those two categorizations, and healthcare is a really nice diversified earnings stream,” said Noah Weisberger, managing director for U.S. portfolio strategy at Bernstein.
Such diversity stems from the variety of companies comprising the sector: manufacturers of prescription medicines, makers of medical devices, such as heart valves and knee replacements, health insurers, hospitals and providers of tools for scientific research.
From a stock perspective, that means the sector includes potential fast-growing stocks, such as biotechs that can carry more risk and more reward, or large pharmaceutical companies and others that offer steadier, slower growth.
Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates sold some pharmaceutical holdings late last year that had posted big gains, such as Merck & Co (N:MRK), to move into biotech stocks it believed were undervalued, said Alan Lancz, the firm's president.
“We have maintained our overweighting, which is unusual for us with a sector that has outperformed so dramatically,"" Lancz said. ""But mainly there are segments within the sector that still offer opportunity.""
(GRAPHIC: Healthcare is most favored sector on Wall Street - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HaLYKT) 
For 2019, healthcare companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase earnings by 7.5 percent, ahead of the 6.3 percent growth estimated for S&P 500 companies overall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH), the sector's third-largest company by market value, kicks off fourth-quarter earnings season for healthcare on Tuesday.
“Healthcare is one of the few sectors with high quality, above-market growth and it’s relatively immune to the array of macro headwinds that we see out there,” said Martin Jarzebowski, sector head of healthcare for Federated Investors.
Healthcare shares could also benefit from anticipation of increased dealmaking activity after two large acquisitions of biotechs were already announced this year.
Despite healthcare's outperformance last year, the sector is trading at the same valuation as the S&P 500 - 14.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months - whereas healthcare on average has held a premium over the market for the past 20 years, according to Refinitiv data.
The sector also is valued at a discount, by such price-to-earnings measures, to defensive sectors, including consumer staples (SPLRCS), which trades at 16.6 times forward earnings, and utilities (SPLRCU), which trades at 15.8 times.
(GRAPHIC: Healthcare stocks, by the numbers - https://tmsnrt.rs/2H7Mnxw) 
According to the Reuters review of sector weightings, healthcare is followed by financials (SPSY), then technology (SPLRCT). Real estate <.SPLRCR> ranks as the most negatively rated group.
The healthcare sector has lagged in the early days of 2019, rising less than 1 percent against a 3 percent rise for the S&P 500.
Some investors doubt healthcare will maintain its outperformance. JP Morgan strategists downgraded the sector to ""underweight"" last month, pointing in part to political rhetoric possibly turning ""more negative on healthcare leading up to the 2020 presidential elections.""
The healthcare sector struggled ahead of the 2016 election, with the high U.S. cost of prescription medicines a prominent issue during the presidential campaign. With renewed scrutiny on drug pricing, such concerns linger.
The sector could suffer if investors become more optimistic about economic growth and flee defensive stocks, while the popularity of healthcare as an investment could work against it if the trade becomes overly crowded.

""There is risk there,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. But given issues affecting other sectors, he said, ""when you look around the market...you arrive by default at healthcare, and so I think that’s why a lot of people are interested in the sector.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are starting to see signs of slowing spending from Chinese tourists, but are still banking on demand shifting to mainland China to fuel growth this year, several high-end brands said on Monday.
Investors are on edge over a softening economic backdrop in China, and weak Chinese trade data on Monday sent shares in luxury goods companies that rely heavily on Chinese customers tumbling.
Some brands like Parmigiani, owned by the Sandoz Family Foundation and which makes around 3,000 pieces a year, with average prices at 35,000 Swiss francs ($35,714), said they believed it was still a good time to invest in China.
""People are traveling less, but consuming more domestically so it is the right moment for us to strengthen our local presence (in China),"" chief executive Davide Traxler told Reuters at the SIHH industry trade fair in Geneva, adding the label, in turnaround mode, was entering that market ""10 years late"".
Parmigiani is repositioning itself at higher price points after trying to take a more accessible tack a few years ago.
Chinese customers make up over a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, but a falling yuan and Chinese government measures like cuts in import taxes are pushing more of those shoppers to splurge domestically. 
Business in Hong Kong lost steam in the last three months of 2018, Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) reported on Friday, and others noted setbacks there and in other parts of Greater China, which includes Macau. 
""We had growth everywhere last year, except for Greater China where we saw a dip in demand due to the trade war in October and November,"" said Edouard Meylan, chief executive of independent Swiss label H. Moser & Cie.
""It has recovered since,"" Meylan said. He added the brand had sold an unusual amount of ""big-ticket"" watches in December and January, but was still wary of nasty surprises. 
""With the shutdown (in the U.S.), the trade war and Brexit, there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment.""
STILL GROWING
Manufacturers of luxury wares from handbags to fancy timepieces have so far played down the chances of a dramatic fallout from a U.S.- China trade stand-off, arguing that appetite from young, middle-class Chinese customers keen to wear branded goods was likely to hold up in the long term. 
""We've noticed a small slowdown, but we're still talking about a growth pattern,"" said Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot brand, which is not exhibiting its watches at the Richemont-dominated SIHH but at a hotel in downtown Geneva. 
Young Chinese clients in their 20s and 30s boosted demand for Hublot watches in 2018, Guadalupe added. 
""In principle this dynamic is going to continue, unless there is a real catastrophe in terms of the geopolitical relations between China and the United States,"" he told Reuters.
Hublot, a stablemate of Tag Heuer and Zenith at LVMH, does not break out revenues. 
But its sales in Greater China - which accounts for 13 percent of its revenues - rose by 60 percent last year, Guadalupe said, helped partly by Hublot's status as a relatively new entrant in China, where it first invested 10 years ago.
That growth could be closer to 10 to 15 percent in 2019 as comparisons get tougher, he added, while Hublot is banking on its global comparable sales expanding by at least 6 to 7 percent after 16 percent growth in 2018.

In its first quarter, Shaw expanded its network for customers in Calgary by launching high-speed wireless spectrum, as it continues to face stiff competition from Telus Corp, Rogers Communications Inc and BCE Inc's Bell Canada.
The company added 65,615 wireless subscribers in the quarter and its total wireless revenue rose nearly 60 percent to C$273 million ($205.71 million).
In addition to the spectrum distribution, the company is also seeking to expand its wireless network into new areas, mostly in Western Canada. 
Revenue from the core wireline business rose slightly to C$1.08 billion.
Telecom service providers in Canada have also been investing heavily in the next generation 5G network to attract data-hungry customers. Shaw completed its first 5G technical trials in Calgary in May 2018.
The company said it was set to meet its fiscal 2019 outlook, which included an estimated free cash flow of C$500 million and capital investment of about C$1.2 billion.
However, Paul McAleese, president - wireless, said on a conference call with analysts that media reports about flattening out of smartphones sales may impact the company's 2019 numbers. 
The Calgary-based company's net income rose to C$187 million ($140.9 million), or 36 Canadian cents per share, for the first quarter ended Nov.30. 
Excluding items, the company earned 36 Canadian cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 31 Canadian cents per share, according IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's quarterly revenue rose 8.8 percent to C$1.36 billion.
Shares of the company were trading higher at $26.76 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

E-mini S&P (March)
Last week’s close: Settled at 2595, up 63.75 on the week.
Fundamentals: Equity markets are under a bit of pressure Monday morning. Price action finished last week right below the near-term exhaustion point in this recovery. Sunday night, the latest trade figures from China whiffed with imports down 7.6% year-over-year versus expectations of 5.0% growth and exports down 4.4% year-over-year vs. an expected 3.0% jump. China’s trade surplus widened to $323 billion, which won’t help trade negotiations.
This morning, Eurozone Industrial Production contracted to -1.7% for the month missing expectations, and was down 3.3% year-over-year. Economic indicators from around the world continue to echo slower growth and trade war headwinds.
The government shutdown may leave many U.S. economic indicators out to dry. Retail Sales, Building Permits and Housing Starts are just a couple of the casualties this week. GDP for Q4, out later this month, is likely to be negatively affected, even if the government reopens today. This will heighten the importance of an already crucial earnings season.
This morning,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) kicked things off and missed revenues but beat on adjusted earnings per share; the stock is down 0.6% premarket. Today’s calendar is bare otherwise and the tape will be very technical, and headline driven.
Technicals: On Friday, 2600 remained elusive and price action traded to a lower high of 2597.75. Despite settling at 2595, the tape gaped lower on last night’s open. This type of price action is certainly a sign of exhaustion. However, when these dips hold it helps refresh the tape.
Crude Oil (February)
Last week’s close: Settled at $51.59, up $3.63 on the week.
Fundamentals: On Friday, we introduced a slight bearish bias in crude oil. This aligns with the narrative we have held in the S&P (SPX) at 2600+. The recovery is reaching its near-term exhaustion point.
Jawboning from Saudi Arabia and thus OPEC last week boosted crude oil to the highest level in a month, but the internal fundamentals remain poor. Week after week we see inventories added and economic indicators from around the world continue to point to a slowdown. Trade data from China last night certainly added pressure to the tape. Given crude oil’s strong gains last week, it would be nice to see the Commitments of Traders report, but the government shutdown has temporarily delayed its publication.
Gold (February)
Last week’s close: Settled at $1,289.5, up $3.70 on the week.
Fundamentals: Gold is holding well at the $1,290 area as it stares down the psychological $1,300 barrier. There is a lack of economic data to boost or dissipate recent gains for the metal but misses around the globe, specifically China and the Eurozone, continue support a slower growth environment, which is favorable for the metal. Earnings season is underway, and this will also be a way to keep a pulse on growth. Today’s calendar is bare but tomorrow, despite the government shutdown, we get the Producer Prices Index (PPI) and NY Empire State Manufacturing along with Fed speak. We remain bullish gold, but the near-term upside may be limited."
998,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Short-term Moves in Crude, Beans and the Dow","The QuantCycle Indicator reveals opportunities in crude oil, soybeans and the Dow Jones Index according to John Rawlins.
This week we present three short-term opportunities from the QuantCycle Indicator.
Dow Jones Index
The QuantCycle indicator presents an interesting scenario this week for the Dow Jones Index. On the 240-minite chart (see chart below), the Dow appears to have some strength left before it makes a significant short-term top. On the daily chart (second chart) that top may not hit for another weak. All things being equal, traders should look at any strong rally as a potential selling opportunity.
Crude Oil
Looking at the QuantCycle indicator for crude oil on a 240-minute chart (top chart) and daily (bottom chart) timeframe reveals a lot of about the recent volatility in the market. The shorter-term chart indicates extreme short-term volatility, while the daily chart shows a steadier, continued rise in crude. In this case, the best play is to view any short-term weakness as an opportunity to get long.
Soybeans
The QuantCycle expects last week’s weakness in soybeans to continue (see top chart). However, both the 240-minute chart and the daily chart (bottom chart) indicate that beans will make an interim low late in the week followed by a rebound. Traders should take profits on any short positions by the end of the week and not carry them into next weekend. While the QuantCycle shows a rebound beginning next week, it is not expected to take out the December high and it will be followed by a significant downturn, so any strength later in the month should be seen as a selling opportunity.
The QuantCycle indicator is a technical tool that employs proprietary statistical techniques and complex algorithms to filter multiple cycles from historical data, combines them to obtain cyclical information from price data and then gives a graphical representation of their predictive behavior (center line forecast). Other proprietary frequency techniques are then employed to obtain the cycles embedded in the prices. The upper and lower bands of the oscillator represent a two-standard deviation move from the predictive price band and are indicative of extreme overbought/oversold conditions."
999,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","If Brexit Plan Fails, Brexit Itself may be in Jeopardy","There are multiple potential scenarios from Tuesday’s vote on PM May’s Brexit plan, including an eventual rejection of Brexit itself. All could be extremely volatile for the pound according to Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst Forex.com.
The much-anticipated, delayed House of Commons vote is about 24 hours away. Ahead of the vote, UK Prime Minister Theresa May has made a last-ditch attempt to persuade members of Parliament to save her version of Brexit with a (dare I say, meaningless) speech in Stock-on-Trent earlier today. Meanwhile the UK government has also published the letter from the EU on the backstop assurances. Among other things, it states that the EU is committed to speedy work on a trade deal by December 2020 to avoid triggering the Irish backstop arrangement and that it is willing to extend the transition period if needed.
Essentially, May’s speech contained nothing we have not heard before, while the EU’s letter is just a clarification of the deal signed last year and it doesn’t contain anything new to change the minds of members of Parliament tomorrow. So, as things stand, Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement still looks like it will get rejected by the parliament on Tuesday.
Assuming the PM does get defeated tomorrow, the pound’s initial reaction will probably be a negative one. But what the pound does after its initial reaction will not only depend on the result but how close or otherwise her deal would have been from passing the meaningful vote. If it gets rejected, say, by only a handful of votes, then the Prime Minister could potentially tweak a few things without too much difficulty in her plan B – if there’s one – which could then pass. She will be obliged to return with new proposals by Monday Jan. 21. If her (revised) deal passes after the first or second parliamentary vote, then this would most likely trigger a rally in the British pound (GBP/USD), for it will pave the way for a soft Brexit.
However, in the more likely event that she gets defeated badly then her plan B will have to be radically different for it to pass the second vote. A heavy defeat will increase the odds of other options, including crashing out of the EU without a deal, which, many believe, is the worst-case scenario. So, the pound, in this case, could fall even more sharply in term of initial reaction.
It is not as simple that, for a heavy defeat in Tuesday’s vote will increase the odds for another EU referendum, too. If the British public were to vote again, this time the results may well be different with the potential for some Brexiteers to change their minds, while there will be more, younger, people eligible to vote, which is likely to boost the remain campaign, judging by the breakdown of the 2016 votes. So, a heavy defeat for May’s plan tomorrow could mean that Brexit may not happen after all. As mentioned, this potential outcome will most likely be negative for the pound initially but depending on the direction of the Brexit situation over the coming weeks, then potentially the pound could benefit if we head towards a second EU referendum.
It is also worth remembering that with much of the negativity already priced in, it is going to be unlikely that the pound will see the sort of a sell-off (in the worst-case scenario) we witnessed back in June 2016, when the outcome of the EU referendum vote shocked the markets. Indeed, given the above considerations, the pound could eventually stage a surprise rally even if May’s deal is defeated heavily, perhaps after an initial drop. So, whatever the outcome of the vote, we think the downside potential for the pound is limited.
In fact, the technical outlook of GBP/USD is beginning to look promising. After forming a couple of doji candles in as many months, there is a hammer candle in the making on the monthly chart of the cable around the 1.26-1.27 long-term support zone (see chart). Obviously, we are in the middle of the month, and the candle is subject to change. On the main daily chart, meanwhile, the GBP/USD has broken above its bearish channel and moved beyond the 50-day moving average.
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com
So, the path of least resistance looks to be to the upside for the pound, as things stand. However, we can’t ignore the fundamentals and importance of tomorrow’s vote. So, at this stage, we are proceeding with extreme caution despite the apparent bullish reversal pattern on the technical charts of the cable. "
1000,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Crude Oil Support Falls on Chinese Weakness, Lack of Trade Deal","OPEC claims to have U.S. fracking producers’ back, though recent weakness is the product of concerns regarding the Chinese economy according to Phil Flynn.
After opening with a bit of optimism about progress in the U.S.-China trade talks in the Sunday night session, crude oil quickly reversed course on weak economic data from China. China’s December exports fell by 4.4% from last year, the biggest drop in two years. Chinese imports also plunged by 7.6%, the biggest drop since 2016.
This is raising concerns of slowing global growth especially after weak industrial output data from Europe. It also raises the question of whether or not the Chinese stimulus, that has been announced, will be enough to ward off a major slowdown in the Chinese economy.
At the same time, it puts more pressure on China to get a trade deal with the United States. That might be a bit harder after China reported that its trade surplus with the United States increased by 17% from last year, coming in at $323.32 billion in 2018. That, according to Reuters, is the highest level since 2006. Exports to the United States increased by 11.3% while U.S. imports to China rose 0.7%.
Bottom line, China needs a deal if they are interested in stopping the free fall in their economy. While some argue they are playing the long game when it comes to this trade war, they really are going to have a hard time recovering if they let this linger much longer.
In the meantime, OPEC over the weekend was congratulating themselves for saving the global oil market and telling us that they were the shale oil producer’s best friend. In fact, if you don’t like OPEC, then just try to imagine a world without OPEC. It’s easy if you try. That’s what OPEC wants you to do.
The Wall Street Journal reported that: “Two of OPEC’s most powerful voices defended the oil cartel’s record Monday, saying it wasn’t at risk of disbanding. The statements came in response to revelations late last week that a Saudi-funded research effort is exploring how a possible OPEC breakup might impact oil markets. The research effort, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, follows several recent accusations by President Trump that the 15-nation organization is driving oil prices higher.
At an energy-industry conference that began on Monday, Suhail al-Mazroui, the Emirati energy minister who also holds OPEC’s rotating presidency, said that without OPEC, “there will be chaos. Some people think things will be better if OPEC doesn’t exist. Things will be way worse,” he said, because oil markets would be unstable. So, you got that going for you.
S&P Platts reports that OPEC has thrown a lifeline to U.S. shale producers by cutting output to boost oil prices, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Sunday, rejecting the notion of a market share battle. 
“I can tell you that many [U.S. shale producers call me when they see that price trend going down and when they see investors starting to turn away, and they say it's time to do something,"" Falih said at an Atlantic Council energy forum in Abu Dhabi. ""Of course, they want us to do all the work. They want to take the benefit. But that's, you know, that's life.”
The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump’s National Security Council asked the Pentagon to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran last year, generating concern at the Pentagon and State Department, current and former U.S. officials said. The request, which hasn’t been previously reported, came after militants fired three mortars into Baghdad’s sprawling diplomatic quarter, home to the U.S. Embassy, on a warm night in early September. The shells—launched by a group aligned with Iran—landed in an open lot and harmed no one.
But they triggered unusual alarm in Washington, where President Trump’s national security team, led by John Bolton, conducted a series of meetings to discuss a forceful U.S. response, including what many saw as the unusual request for options to strike Iran. “It definitely rattled people,” a former senior U.S. administration official said of the request. “People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran.”
Natural Gas
Winter is back and so is natural gas. Andrew Weisman, of EBW Analytics, writes that as of Sunday night, NYMEX natural gas appeared set to rise sharply on Monday. Over the weekend, major weather service providers added 32.97 gHDDs in the 15-day forecast window and continued to add degree days through the end of January. The move up for gas triggered by this gain will not be as steep as it would have been if it had occurred earlier this month. If the degree day gain holds up on Monday, though, the February natural gas contract could challenge resistance at $3.38/MMBtu or higher.
The return of colder-than-normal weather along the Atlantic Coast should bolster regional power demand and support higher local day-ahead electricity prices. Current forecasts favor an extended bout of below-normal temperatures for the eastern United States.
For oil and products, we are at the mercy of outside markets. This comes as more reports of a clogged Houston Shipping channel as super tankers slow U.S. oil exports. The Channel may need to be expanded so U.S. oil and product exports could be slowed."

Citigroup reported earnings of $1.61 a share, topping expectations for earnings of $1.55 a share, while revenue of $17.12 billion missed estimates of $17.57 billion. Its shares rose 4.4%.
The weaker-than-expected revenue was driven by a decline in the bank's fixed income business, which the company blamed on a ""volatile"" fourth quarter.
The mixed report from Citigroup did little to deter market participants, as investors viewed the recent sell off as ""perhaps being overdone given the overall quality in the Citigroup report,"" according to Briefing.com.
Citi's strong gains triggered a wave of buys across banking stocks, as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC), both of which report fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow before U.S. markets open, gained 1%.
Analysts are expected to parse JPMorgan's report for clues on credit quality as market volatility, economic uncertainty and falling oil prices during the fourth quarter has raised concerns about liquidity.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>",Pernod Ricard to meet activist Elliott ahead of earnings update: sources,"By Dominique Vidalon and Maiya Keidan
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) will meet activist hedge fund Elliott this month as the family-backed spirits firm faces pressure to improve its margins, sources familiar with the situation said.
Although chief executive Alexandre Ricard is expected to present his new strategy plan later this year, some analysts expect Pernod Ricard to give some direction on margins when it publishes first-half earnings on Feb. 7.
Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott, which is being advised by French business and political establishment insider Alain Minc, is hopeful that Ricard will deliver some of the changes it has proposed, including improving investor returns, one source said.
The activist fund, which has become more active in Europe in recent years, revealed in December that it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) building a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod Ricard and called on it to improve profit margins and governance.
Elliott, which the first source said views its dialogue with Pernod Ricard as constructive, has called for some 500 million euros of cost cuts, suggested options such as merging with another spirits company and said its board needed more independence as many directors have Ricard family links.
But Ricard had inherited ""a very, very heavy structure in terms of inertia and culture"", the same source said.
""The CEO, no matter how good he is or how good his intentions are, cannot single-handedly change the direction of a company or improve its culture,"" the source added.
A top-20 investor in Pernod Ricard cited its share price as evidence the company was moving in the right direction under Ricard, the 46-year-old grandson of the company's founder, who took over in 2015 and made sales growth his top priority.
""I often think the market is the best judge of CEO performance... (looking at) the forward PE (price-earnings) of Pernod and arguably its best peer,  Diageo  (LON:DGE), Pernod always traded at a discount, but is now at the premium,"" he said.
FAMILY GROUP 
Elliott met Ricard, who is expected to attend this month's meeting, on Nov. 22 after an annual meeting at which he said he was preparing a three-year strategic plan to accelerate growth.
There have been follow-up technical meetings between the two sides, but some doubt that Elliott can change much as the Ricard family controls 15 percent of Pernod Ricard's shares and 21 percent of voting rights, while long-time investor GBL owns a 7.5 percent stake and has said its supports the firm's strategy.
Meanwhile, the French government warned in December it wanted ""big French companies to have stable and long-term shareholders"" and did not want them to be ""subject to pressure from shareholders who want short-term profitability""
While Pernod has said it valued ""constructive input"" from shareholders, it has defended its long-term value strategy, which, helped by a recovery in Chinese demand for premium spirits, saw sales growth rise to 6 percent in 2017/18.
There have been cost cuts under its existing efficiency plan, but some analysts have said more could be done at Pernod Ricard, which had a profit margin of 26.23 percent in 2017/18 against rival Diageo's 31.4 percent.
""Already you have a good company to begin with, you could make it a lot better,"" one source said.
With sales growing again, Pernod Ricard has said it is time to combine short-term profitability and long-term sustainable growth, prompting analysts at Liberum to say:
""We believe the group will set targets to exceed 30 percent operating profit margins by 2021.""

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Newmont takes top gold producer spot with $10 billion Goldcorp buy,"By John Benny and Nichola Saminather
(Reuters) -  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc for $10 billion, creating the world's biggest gold producer in the face of dwindling easy-to-find reserves of the precious metal.
The transaction, the biggest ever takeover in the gold sector according to Refinitiv, follows Barrick Gold Corp's agreement in September to buy  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd in a deal valued at $6.1 billion.
""Combining forces will give us the sector's best project pipeline and exploration portfolio,"" Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said on a conference call with analysts. ""These prospects translate to the gold sector's largest reserve and resource base.""
Vancouver-based Goldcorp's Toronto-listed shares rose 7 percent to C$13.75 at 12:03 p.m. ET (1703 GMT). Newmont Mining's shares were down about 8.8 percent at $31.83 in New York.
In recent years, investor criticism over inadequate management of capital had largely kept gold companies focused on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions. But the need to bolster shrinking reserves and production and a rising gold price are now serving as catalysts for increased dealmaking.
Spot gold prices are up 11.3 percent since an August trough, when they had declined 15 percent from a January 2018 peak.
Newmont's acquisition of Goldcorp could spark further consolidation in the industry, where too many gold companies are chasing too few assets, Michael Siperco from Macquarie Research said. He did not specify which companies are most likely to follow suit.
The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, is set to overtake current leader Barrick Gold's annual production and will have mines in the Americas, Australia and Ghana.
""This transaction is positive for Newmont, because it establishes it as the world's leading gold producer with a deal that is accretive on nearly all key metrics,"" analysts at Scotiabank wrote in a note. 
The new company will be led by Newmont's Goldberg. He will retire at the end of 2019, when Tom Palmer, Newmont's chief operating officer, will take over as the CEO, the companies said.
Denver, Colorado-based Newmont expects savings of $100 million a year. The combined company will sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of assets over the next two years as part of the deal, mirroring a similar move by Barrick when it announced the Rangold acquisition.
The new company is expected to produce 6-7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years and beyond versus Barrick's 2018 forecast of between 4.5 million and 5 million ounces.
Newmont will offer 0.3280 of its share and $0.02 for each Goldcorp share. Based on Newmont's Friday close, that translates to $11.46 per share, a premium of about 18 percent to Goldcorp's Friday close on the New York Stock Exchange. nBw4JX5tpa]
That remains below premiums paid in the last decade for gold deals,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note.
The transaction is scheduled to close in the second quarter, the companies said.

BMO Capital Markets, Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are working as financial advisors for Newmont, while Goldcorp has retained TD Securities and BofA Merrill Lynch as financial advisors, the companies said.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>",FedEx pays $35.4 million to end NY lawsuit over illegal cigarettes,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) will pay $35.4 million to settle three lawsuits in which New York state and New York City accused the company of shipping millions of untaxed cigarettes to residents over a decade.
The settlement announced on Monday came after a judge ruled last Oct. 15 that FedEx had knowingly violated a federal anti-cigarette trafficking statute, and a 2006 agreement with the state not to ship cigarettes to people's homes.
New York officials said FedEx's conduct undercut their efforts to protect public health by curbing smoking, and cheated the state and city out of tax revenue from cigarette sales.
They said FedEx knowingly shipped cigarettes on behalf of such companies as Kentucky-based Cigarettes Direct To You and Long Island-based Shinnecock Smoke Shop.
""Not only did FedEx violate laws created to protect the public from the serious health risks associated with cigarettes, but they also swindled New York City and State out of millions of dollars in tax revenue,"" state Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Zachary Carter, New York City's corporation counsel, accused FedEx of shipping cigarettes ""for the worst of reasons --profit.""
The settlement agreement requires Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx to stop domestic shipments of cigarettes with ""limited"" exceptions, punish workers who knowingly arrange such shipments, and hire an independent consultant to monitor its compliance.
FedEx did not admit or deny wrongdoing in entering the two-year agreement, which can be extended upon a material breach.
The company had no immediate additional comment.
In the Oct. 15 ruling, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan said it was ""beyond doubt that certain FedEx employees knew that FedEx was shipping unstamped cigarettes,"" and held the company responsible for that knowledge.
The settlement came after U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ordered  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) in May 2017 to pay the state and city $247 million in damages and penalties in a similar case.
A federal appeals court will in March consider UPS' appeal of that award, which the company said resulted from a ""cavalcade of errors"" by Forrest, who is now in private practice.
Cigarette prices in New York are among the highest in the United States.

New York City last year set a minimum price of $13 per pack, and this month banned cigarette sales at pharmacies.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rejects challenge to consumer protection bureau,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a Texas bank's constitutional challenge to the structure of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, passing up a case that could have led to more presidential power over an independent agency that President Donald Trump's administration already has weakened.
The decision by the justices not to hear an appeal by State National Bank of Big Spring may not be the final word on the matter as three other cases involving the CFPB are heading toward the high court. 
At issue was whether the CFPB's sole director possesses too much power in violation of the authority the U.S. Constitution gives a president to appoint and remove certain federal officials. A ruling in favor of the bank could have allowed a president to fire the agency's director for any reason.
The CFPB, a consumer watchdog agency often criticized by conservatives and Trump's fellow Republicans, was established in 2011 under legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that was passed by a Congress controlled by Obama's fellow Democrats to crack down on predatory financial practices after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
""The case raises constitutional issues of major importance regarding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that wields massive power over the economic activities of the public and sets a dangerous precedent for unaccountable federal bureaucracy,"" said Sam Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative group involved in the challenge.
Democrats have said the agency plays a critical role in protecting consumers.
The Texas bank's challenge was delayed in reaching the justices because it was put on hold while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dealt with a case involving mortgage servicer PHH Corp that had raised the same issues. 
Only eight of the nine justices on the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, participated in the decision to hear the case. Trump's appointee Brett Kavanaugh recused himself, most likely because he took part in an earlier ruling in the case before joining the high court last October.
The agency was set up under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Since then, there have been efforts by Republicans and the financial industry to undercut its authority, driven by concerns about its powers over a wide array of financial products and its structure.
The Trump administration has shelved several rules and aggressively curtailed the agency's enforcement.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:17PM ET</span>","U.S. government shutdown holds up FAA approval of aircraft, routes","By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of aircraft such as Boeing's (N:BA) MAX 8 and new routes like Southwest Airline Co's (N:LUV) Hawaii launch are on hold due to the U.S. government shutdown, delaying commercial operations.
On Monday, Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said its plans to launch service to Hawaii early this year are on hold because the FAA groups that oversee the route authorization process are on furlough.
In a statement, Southwest said it will not announce any timelines for selling or operating flights to Hawaii until it receives the necessary authorization.
Meanwhile, no. 1 U.S. carrier  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said it has taken delivery of two new MAX 8, but the planes are sitting idle in Tulsa, Oklahoma awaiting FAA approvals required for commercial operation.
American, with a fleet of around 950 aircraft, said it did not see any impact from the delay on its flight schedule or customers.
United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) are among other U.S. carriers awaiting FAA certification of new aircraft. The airlines did not reply to requests for details. 
A partial U.S. government shutdown over President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border entered its 24th day on Monday.
Talks between Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of his fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal, as tension mounted nationwide. 
Analysts said they did not expect a major impact on large airlines' capacity as a result of FAA certification delays, but will be awaiting management comments about the effect of a prolonged shutdown on travel and operations during fourth-quarter conference calls.

Delta reports fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, followed by United on Wednesday and American and Southwest next week.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo settles SEC lawsuit over Curt Schilling's 38 Studios,"(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) agreed to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fraud lawsuit related to a $75 million bond offering for 38 Studios Inc, a now-bankrupt video game company founded by former All-Star major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling.
The settlement in principle with the bank's Wells Fargo Securities unit was disclosed in a Jan. 10 filing with the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island.
Terms were not disclosed. Wells Fargo and the SEC said the partial federal government shutdown is delaying a final settlement, and asked a federal judge to put the case on hold.
Wells Fargo did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. The SEC did not respond to similar requests.
Wells Fargo was accused of concealing from investors that 38 Studios would face a $25 million shortfall even after the October 2010 bond offering from Rhode Island Commerce Corp, a state economic development agency.
The SEC said 38 Studios received only $50 million from the offering, with most of the rest set aside for interest and other payments, after claiming to need $75 million to develop a video game code-named Copernicus.
Wells Fargo was also accused of concealing its overall fees related to 38 Studios from investors. 
Peter Cannava, Wells Fargo's lead banker on the bond offering, remains a defendant in the SEC case and did not object to the delay, according to Thursday's filing.
38 Studios filed to liquidate in bankruptcy in June 2012 after defaulting on the loan.
Schilling won 216 games in his 20-year career, and helped lead the Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox to World Series championships in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

He has said 38 Studios' demise cost him $50 million. The SEC did not charge him in the Wells Fargo case.

Philippe Balducchi, head of an Airbus-led venture which took over production of the loss-making A220 last year, indicated the bulk of the reduction in costs would come from the supply chain as Airbus uses its greater clout in negotiations for parts.
Other savings would come from more efficient operations as workers gain experience of building the lightweight 110-130-seat jet, whose deliveries doubled to 33 aircraft last year. 
But overall economies will go ""way beyond"" what Airbus can achieve internally on the assembly line, Balducchi said.
""Our focus is to sell, ramp up (production) and reduce costs on the A220,"" Rob Dewar, head of engineering and customer support, added during a media briefing on the jet, which was known as the CSeries until Airbus took control in July 2018.
The A220 consortium, which also includes Bombardier and the Quebec government, is spending some $30 million to expand its Mirabel production plant outside Montreal and will break ground this week on a new assembly line in Alabama for U.S. airlines.
Airbus meanwhile said the Canadian-developed A220 jet had won approval to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport in the event of a shutdown of one of its two engines - a safety standard which underpins its use on longer-range routes.

The extended operations or ETOPS approval was granted by agencies in Canada, the United States and Europe and affects the number of routes the plane can fly over water or remote areas.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said on Monday it is investing $800 million to build a new electric vehicle at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as it shifts toward zero emission vehicles.
The German automaker, in an announcement at the Detroit Auto Show, said it is adding 1,000 new jobs and that electric vehicle production in Tennessee will begin in 2022.
German automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to increase their investments in the United States.
VW will use a modular electric toolkit chassis (MEB) in Chattanooga. VW designed MEB to be the basic building block for its EVs and is intended to consolidate all of the vehicle's electronic controls and reduce the number of microprocessors. 
Volkswagen is building the first dedicated EV production facility in Zwickau, Germany, starting MEB production by the end of 2019.
Volkswagen will add EV production at facilities in Anting and Foshan, in China, in 2020, and in the German cities of Emden and Hanover by 2022.

""We obviously think electric vehicles are going to play a more and more prominent role,"" said Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, who took part in the announcement.

A trade conflict between the United States and China is having an adverse impact on the German auto industry, which has four large car factories in the United States and employs 118,000 people there, German auto industry association VDA said.
German carmakers shipped 95,000 light vehicles, including sport-utility vehicles made by BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) from the United States to China last year, down from 150,000 a year earlier, VDA said.
In total, German carmakers made 750,000 vehicles at their U.S. plants, of which 56 percent were exported to Europe and China, while around 470,000 vehicles made by German carmakers were imported to the United States from Europe, VDA said. 
""Recent developments once again proved that the automotive industry and the jobs it provides depend heavily on free and fair trade,"" said Klaus Braeunig, managing director of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. 
""This is why we are deeply concerned about the direction that U.S. trade policy has taken since 2017. We should always keep in mind that together the EU and the U.S. account for 50 percent of world trade,"" Braeunig said in a statement.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",China says countries should end 'fabrications' about Huawei,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday urged countries to end ""fabrications"" about Huawei, after an official in Poland said his country could limit the use of the company's products by public entities following the arrest of a Huawei employee there on spying allegations.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and U.S.-led allegations that its devices could be used by Beijing for espionage.
No evidence has been produced publicly and Huawei [HWT.UL] has repeatedly denied the accusations, but several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets.
Poland arrested a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on spying allegations on Friday, officials and sources told Reuters.
A Polish government official responsible for cyber security, Karol Okonski, told Reuters on Sunday that ""abrupt"" policy changes toward Huawei were not warranted after the arrests, but that the use of the company's products by state entities could be reviewed. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, responding to the remarks at a regular news briefing in Beijing, said China hoped the Polish side would work to create mutual trust and maintain relations.
Hua said ""some people"" seek to use groundless accusations about security threats to ""suppress and restrict Chinese technology companies' development abroad"".
""We urge relevant parties to cease the groundless fabrications and unreasonable restrictions toward Huawei and other Chinese companies, and create a fair, good and just environment for mutual investment and normal cooperation by both sides' companies,"" Hua said.
""Using security reasons to hype, obstruct or restrict normal cooperation between companies in the end will only hurt one's own interests,"" she added.
Seeking to distance itself from the incident, Huawei said on Saturday it had sacked the employee arrested in Poland, Wang Weijing, adding that his ""alleged actions have no relation to the company.""
A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for Wang showed he has worked for Huawei's Polish division since 2011, and previously served as attache to the Chinese General Consul in Gdansk from 2006-2011. 
A spokesman for the Polish security services said that the allegations related to individual actions, and were not linked directly to Huawei. 
Poland's internal affairs minister, Joachim Brudzinski, has called for the European Union and NATO to work on a joint position over whether to exclude Huawei from their markets.
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government from using Huawei equipment and is considering an executive order that would also ban U.S. companies from doing so.

Australia and New Zealand have also blocked it from building 5G networks amid concerns of its possible links with Beijing.

1034,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",Bed Bath & Beyond jumps after beating on profits," Bed Bath & Beyond soared 9% to $13.36 a share early Thursday as investors brushed off soft sales and instead focused on its better-than-expected profit.
The home-goods seller announced late Wednesday that it earned $0.18 a share in the third quarter — $0.01 better than the Wall Street consensus, according to Bloomberg data. Its revenue totaled $3.03 billion, slightly missing the $3.04 billion that was expected. 
But the results weren't all good. The company's same-store sales declined 1.8%, missing the 0.2% decrease that analysts estimated. 
Looking ahead, Bed Bath & Beyond maintained its earnings guidance of $2 per share, topping the $1.97 that analysts were expecting. 
The company's guidance reflects many factors, including ""the holiday selling season; the continuation of trends it has been experiencing; and actions being taken in support of the company's stronger bias towards prioritizing long-term profitability over near-term sales growth,"" said Bed Bath & Beyond in a  press release. 
But at least one Wall Street analyst was skeptical of the plan. "

But the bank missed on revenues, which fell 2% compared with last year, as fixed-income trading got whacked amid the market turmoil, falling 21%.
The bank also missed on its full-year target of a 100-basis-point improvement in operating efficiency, improving 86 basis points to 57.4%.
Here's what else you need to know:
“A volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market sensitive businesses, particularly Fixed Income.

Citi isn't expected to be alone in posting lackluster trading and investment banking numbers.

MNG said it will offer $12 per Gannett share, representing a premium of 23 percent to the company's close on Friday.
In a letter sent to Gannett's board, MNG said it had approached the company's board and management on multiple occasions about a potential combination, but Gannett had not ""meaningfully engaged"".
Gannett, whose shares rose 20 percent to $11.70 in trading before the bell, said it will review the proposal. MNG said it could also ask for changes to Gannett's board composition. 
Faced with declining advertising and circulation revenue in the print media industry, Gannett has made significant investments in the digital media sector.
The company is also in the middle of finding a successor for its current Chief Executive Officer Robert Dickey, who is slated to retire in May this year. 
MNG, which has a 7.5 percent stake in Gannett, opposed the latter's digital acquisition strategy and said a sale of the company is the best path forward. It also urged Gannett to hire an investment bank to conduct a review of options.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - In his first major management reshuffle since taking the helm of Brazil's Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Chief Executive Officer Octavio de Lazari has cut the number of executive vice-president positions as part of a consolidation to boost revenue.
The country's second largest private lender said in a statement on Monday it was reducing the number of executive vice presidents from six to four, with Josué Augusto Pancini and Mauricio Machado de Minas leaving their positions but remaining as board members.
The new divisions will focus on retail, wholesale and high-income clients, while the new information technology vice-president position will support all business areas, Bradesco said.
The changes come almost one year into de Lazari's tenure as CEO, with the goal of increasing revenue per client.
Eurico Fabri, Marcelo Noronha and Cassiano Scarpelli will continue overseeing retail, wholesale and high-income clients, but they will expand their divisions. André Cano will take over the information technology operations, in addition to areas he was already responsible for, such as the legal department and human resources.
The four remaining vice presidents will be larger and more powerful. Bradesco's move is similar to a reorganization that its main rival, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), did in 2015.
Bradesco's preferred shares were up 0.27 percent in early morning trading, roughly in line with Brazil's benchmark index Bovespa.

The bank also said Leandro Miranda, the former managing director of its investment banking unit, will be promoted to oversee Bradesco's investor relations. Henrique Lima will take over Miranda's post at Bradesco BBI.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - ACWA Power is considering supporting the manufacturing of solar panels in Saudi Arabia, its chief executive said, as the power and water plants developer seeks to facilitate Saudi Arabia's plans to develop its renewable power industry.
Riyadh-based ACWA Power, partly owned by Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF), does not plan to become a manufacturer of solar panels, but is ""open to the idea of supporting and enabling the right environment in the Kingdom to welcome in manufacturers,"" a spokesman told Reuters.
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son announced in March last year a plan to invest in creating the world's biggest solar power project in Saudi Arabia, a project expected to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.
The project is set to create thousands of jobs and develop a manufacturing industry in line with Saudi Arabia's economic diversification plans laid out in its Vision 2030.
ACWA Power plans to double its power production capacity by 2025 and to expand its operations to 25 markets from the current 12. ""We expect renewables to be a significant part of that growth,"" ACWA's CEO, Paddy Padmanathan said.
ACWA mandated banks last year to sell a 30 percent stake through an initial public offering (IPO). Sources told Reuters at the time that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Natixis and Riyad Capital had been appointed to advise on that process.
Padmanathan said on Monday that the IPO was postponed as the company had a lot of preparatory work to do and its balance sheet had to be ""positioned in the right way,"" but added that the company is still committed to a listing, and the banks that were mandated have retained their role.
(This story has been corrected to remove incorrect quote, change headline and body to reflect ACWA is considering supporting manufacturing, but does not plan to manufacture itself)

Denver, Colorado-based Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) was formed in the 2005 merger of Coors Brewing Co. and Canada's Molson.
It also owns the Miller Brewing company through its wholly-owned MillerCoors subsidiary, the second-largest seller of beer in North America, trailing only Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BUD). Analysts expect 2018 revenue of $10.97 billion, down 0.3% from 2017.
Molson Coors has grown EBITDA 26.8% annually over the past five years, while the company trades at discounts to five-year average valuations on nearly every metric you can measure.
Molson Coors and its predecessor organizations have been paying dividends for more than 30 years. Annual dividends of $1.64 are not a stretch. Molson Coors produced free cash flow per share of $8.07 over the past 12 months.

1049,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings OLLI,"With the recent market pullback, shares of growing retailer Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are priced for a solid return in 2019. The firm was founded in 1982 in Harrisburg, Penn. Since then, the company has expanded to more than 300 stores in the eastern U.S., observes Doug Gerlach, editor of SmallCap Informer.
The stores sell an assortment of merchandise: housewares, food, bed and bath, books, floor coverings, electronics, and toys. The chain’s slogan is “Good Stuff Cheap,” and stores offer a “treasure-hunt shopping experience” where customers never know exactly what they might find.
Much of Ollie’s shelves contain close-out merchandise acquired from other retail stores that have shut down. Recent closures of Toys-R-Us and Sears are the kinds of opportunities that Ollie’s likes to take advantage of, taking on large inventories all at once.
Ollie’s offers a loyalty program for customers, “Ollie’s Army,” which provides incentives, discounts, and brand awareness. Members spend 40% more than non-members per shopping trip, and accounting for more than 70% of sales in fiscal 2017.
While many retail companies are considered cyclical, the discount stores industry is considered defensive. Customers often flock to discount retailers during tough economic times, preferring to shop where their dollars go further.
Since 2013, Ollie’s has grown revenues at a practically straight-lined 18.7%. EPS have grown at a 41.5% annualized pace since 2014 on the strength of continuous margin improvement. Ollie’s claims that the U.S. can support 950 stores, and their two existing distribution centers can support up to 400 stores.
The real estate pipeline for Ollie’s is robust given the disruptions caused in the retail sector by e-commerce, giving the company access to many prime locations given up by other stores. Indeed, the company recently purchased of 12 former Toys “R” Us properties.
We believe Ollie’s will continue to grow revenues at least 20% annually on average over the next five years, with margin expansion fueling EPS growth of 25% a year. Cash flow is good and the balance sheet looks healthy.
Ollie’s current trailing P/E is 28. Capping our future high P/E at 25 may be too conservative, but a high price of $180 is possible. On the downside, we see risk to $55. The reward/risk ratio is 11:1 from the high to the low price, with a 22.5% projected total annualized rate of return.

1050,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Fortis Inc. FTS,"If the wind-down to 2018 was any indication, the New Year may be one that sees investors in survival mode. That makes utilities, which were hit hard by interest rate hikes in 2018, a good choice, suggests Gordon Pape, a Canada-based investment expert and editor of Internet Wealth Builder.
The pace of rate increases should slow, and investors will be more interested in stable companies with limited downside and good yields.
My choice for conservative investors for 2019 is Fortis Inc. (FTS), a Canadian-based electricity and gas producer/distributor. It has total assets of about $50 billion. The corporation's 8,500 employees serve utility customers in five Canadian provinces, nine U.S. states, and three Caribbean countries.
The company is investing heavily in new projects, with $1.5 billion spent in the first six months of the year and another $1.7 billion expected in the second half.
The stock pays $0.425 per month ($1.70 per year) to yield 4% at the current price. The company has raised its dividend every year for more than 40 years, with the next hike expected in the fall.
This is not an exciting company, but it is sound, has a strong U.S. position in Florida and New Mexico, and has a 45-year history of annual dividend increases. It won’t make you a bundle, but you’ll sleep well at night.

1051,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Lockheed Martin LMT," Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) is a defense prime contractor with key businesses in Aeronautics (F-35, F-16, F-22 programs), mission systems (cybersecurity and surveillance) and missiles, suggests John Eade, analyst with the leading independent research firm, Argus Research.
With a Republican in the White House, the outlook for defense spending has brightened and is a far cry from the days of sequestration.
Congress recently easily passed a $717 billion defense spending package for FY19. In addition, President Trump is urging U.S. allies to beef up their defense spending.
The company has a record of double-digit dividend hikes, including a 10% increase in September 2018. The double-digit hike underscores LMT’s financial strength, strong focus on shareholder returns, and positive growth outlook.
Lockheed is a well-managed company with a long record of market outperformance. Management consistently sets conservative guidance and raises its outlook as the year progresses. Returns have topped the industry ETF IYJ over trailing one-year and five-year periods.
The shares are attractively valued compared to the historical record. They are trading 18% below their all-time high amid trade and tariff concerns.
The projected 2019 P/E of 17 is toward the low end of historical range of 15-24. The dividend yield of 3.0% is at high end of the industry range, signaling value. Our 12-month target price is $385 per share.

1052,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Newmont Mining Corporation NEM,"We have favored gold stocks since 9/11, when we declared the start of a “Super” bull market for bullion and associated mining shares, explains market timing strategist Alan Newman, editor of Crosscurrents.
 Newmont Mining  (NYSE:NEM) is one of the largest miners. They acquire, develop and explore for gold, silver and copper. Operations and assets are in the United States, Australia, Peru, Ghana and Suriname.
Proven and probable gold reserves as of February 2018 were 68.5 million ounces, worth $85.6 billion at the current price of bullion, which also works out to over $160 of reserves per share.
Newmont Mining traded as high as $81.90 in 1987, only weeks before the Crash of ’87 and traded as high as $72.42 when bullion hit a peak over $1900 per oz. in 2011. We believe those levels will again be achievable if our long-term forecast of $3000 to $3500 per oz. bullion proves correct. 
While this might not seem a very big deal for investors buying shares at current levels, Newmont Mining is capable of paying huge dividends and indeed, actively pursued a higher dividend policy when bullion was racing towards the 2011 peak.
Newmont is huge; their aggregate land amount to approximately 23,000 square miles, which would rank as the 119th largest country in the world, not all that far from the entirety of Ireland. The shares have been in a modest uptrend since the mid-September 2018 low of $29.32.

1053,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Automatic Data Processing ADP,"Automatic Data Processing (ADP (NASDAQ:ADP)) is said to be the largest U.S.-based supplier of payroll processing, benefits management, tax reporting and related data processing services to mid-sized companies, notes Harry Domash, income specialist and editor of Dividend Detective.
ADP also offers Professional Employer Organization (PEO) services, which provides Human Resources (HR) services such as payroll tax filing, human resources guidance, retirement planning, health benefits administration, etc. 
With 13 of the 19 analysts that are following it rating ADP at “hold,” which often really means “sell,” ADP is a contrarian play.
One reason for analysts’ sour outlook was that ADP, founded in 1949, had been slow to update its software to reflect current industry practices, hurting its competitive position. However, ADP has gone a long way towards resolving those issues, including making a couple of key acquisitions. It also recently acquired an international provider of payroll management services, considerably extending its global reach.
Thanks to those efforts, ADP has beat analyst earnings forecasts in each of its last four quarters. For instance, for its most recent quarter ending in September, earnings came in at $1.20 per share, $0.09 above forecasts, and up 28 percent over year-ago. ADP also raised nest year’s EPS and revenue guidance. 
ADP, currently paying dividends equating to a 2.4 percent yield, has a strong dividend growth track record. It announced an 11 percent raise in December 2017, followed by a 10 percent hike in June 2018, and then a 14 percent raise in November. To put all of that into perspective, ADP’s $0.79 per share December dividend was 25 percent above its year-ago payout.
All else equal, positive EPS surprises combined with higher future guidance (beat & raise) typically pushes share prices up. Consequently, thanks to its recent track record of consistent EPS surprises, even after the market sell-off, ADP’s still returned 12 percent (including dividends) for 2018.
The good news is that analysts are only forecasting 7 percent EPS growth for 2019, leaving plenty of room for further upside surprises. The stock made shareholders happy in 2018 and could continue its winning ways this year.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>","China trade shock hits global stocks, commodities","By Karin Strohecker and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets and commodities took a hit on Monday after a shock contraction in Chinese trade pointed to deepening cracks in the world's second-largest economy and sparked fears of a sharper slowdown in global growth.
Data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December while analysts had predicted a 5 percent rise. Exports dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3 percent gain.
For an interactive version of the following chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2SRopIf.
The data reinforced fears U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were starting to hit China's cooling economy, while softening demand has been felt around the world with sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles slowing, prompting profit warnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among others.
Adding to the gloom were weak industrial output numbers from the euro zone, which posted their largest fall in nearly three years. 
The index of Europe's leading 300 shares (FTEU3) fell 0.9 percent by noon in London. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and France's CAC (FCHI) were down over half a percent and 0.9 percent respectively, with shares in European luxury goods companies and the automotive sector suffering some of the biggest declines.
The falls in Europe followed hefty declines in Asia where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific ex-Japan shares lost around 1 percent from Friday's 1-1/2 month high - its biggest single-day percentage drop since Jan. 2. Chinese (CSI300) and Hong Kong shares (HIS) suffered the worst hits.
""December's (China) trade data were soft, but the data for the preceding months were surprisingly strong and show exports to the US growing at a decent pace, which may reflect producers trying to front-run any future escalation in tariffs,"" wrote Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics in a note to clients.
U.S. futures showed no let-up on the horizon, with Nasdaq e-mini futures (NQc1) pointing to falls over 1 percent for tech stocks while industrials  looked set to open 0.9 percent softer. 
COMMODITIES SUFFER
The prospect of slowing global growth also roiled commodity markets, with oil prices slipping over 1 percent. Industrial metals copper  and aluminum lost ground in London and Shanghai. 
Safe-haven trades benefited from the equity pullback with U.S. 10-year Treasury yields falling to as low as 2.6690 percent - their lowest level in a week - while gold prices gained. 
The world's two largest economies have been in talks for months to try and resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs of substantial progress.
Some analysts expect China's latest data to provide impetus to Beijing to resolve the trade dispute with Washington. 
Though Citi analysts said even with the rising probability for both sides to reach an agreement, the tariff and trade disruption appears to have already rippled through the global economy. 
""Regional trade growth appears to have slowed substantially after front-loading effect diminished,"" they said.
In light of the trade dispute, China's policymakers have already pledged to step up support this year, following a raft of measures in 2018 including fast tracking infrastructure projects and cuts in banks' reserve requirements and taxes.
In currency markets, the yuan gave up some recent gains in both onshore  and offshore  trading. The Chinese currency had recorded its best week in more than a decade last week. 
However, this could change, said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy EMEA at  State Street  (NYSE:STT). 
""The weakness in the Chinese data is calling into question the recent strength of the renminbi,"" said Graf. ""The downside for dollar/Chinese yuan is limited and that has implications for the euro and the Aussie dollar.""
The dollar index as measured against a basket of currencies nudged 0.1 percent lower to 95.558. The Australian dollar  and New Zealand dollar  - both gauges of global risk appetite - were both last down 0.3 percent. 
The euro was flat at $1.14710 (EUR=). 
Britain's pound  hit a seven-week high as Prime Minister Theresa May made last-ditch efforts to garner lawmakers' support for her Brexit divorce deal, which looks almost certain to fail when it is put to a vote on Tuesday. 
For the U.S. trading day, banks will be in sharp focus as they kick off the earnings season. Quarterly results from  Citigroup  (N:C) are due on Monday followed by JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) later this week. 
Expectations are downbeat with profits for U.S. companies forecast to rise 6.4 percent, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent and a big drop from 2018's tax cut-fuelled gain of more than 20 percent.

Investor attention was also on the U.S. government shutdown, in its 24th day with no resolution in sight.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Monte dei Paschi shares suspended after plunging on ECB warning,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) were suspended on Monday after sliding by 8.5 percent on news of a stark European Central Bank warning for the Italian bank.
The ECB had flagged funding and profitability risks as well as a weakened capital position in a letter to Monte dei Paschi, the bailed-out lender revealed late on Friday. The regulator also told the Tuscan lender to boost provisions against bad loans in the coming years.
Traders said the request for fresh loan writedowns was damaging for the stock and could also have negative implications for other lenders.
Italy's banking index (FTIT8300) fell 2.2 percent.
Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had told it to put aside more money to cover impaired loans by 2026, in line with rules requiring euro zone banks to perform full writedowns within seven years for new loans that turn sour after April 2018.
A request to apply such a rule to existing loans was unexpected, analysts said, adding that it raised doubts over whether the ECB may make similar demands to other banks.
By 1032 GMT shares in Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) were down 3.8 percent and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) 3 percent.
Even after a record 24 billion euro ($28 billion) sale of bad loans, Monte dei Paschi problem loans as of last September were equivalent to almost a fifth of its total lending. Provisions covered 56.4 percent of existing problem loans.
Banca Akros analyst Luigi Tramontana calculated that Monte dei Paschi would need to book 8.7 billion euros in additional provisions to fully cover existing problem loans, though that did not take account of possible recoveries.
The ECB's request ""comes as a surprise to us"", Tramontana said, downgrading the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
Monte dei Paschi is seeking to restructure after its 8 billion euro bailout. Bankers say that a successful turnaround is essential to turn it into an attractive merger target, giving the Italian state a way out as demanded by European Union law on state aid.
Under the terms of the bailout agreed with the European Commission, Monte dei Paschi must meet given targets at set deadlines or adopt offsetting measures. Additional cost cuts risk further complicating the bank's recovery efforts.
Italy's government must draw up a plan this year to liquidate its stake in Monte dei Paschi.
Cabinet Undersecretary Giancarlo Giorgetti was quoted by Italian newspapers on Monday as saying the government would make a decision on the bank's future in two to three months.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 Personal Goods Index was down 1.3% by 6:49AM ET (11:49 GMT), reversing some of last week's gains which saw it hit a one-month high.

China's December exports unexpectedly fell 4.4% from a year earlier, the most in two years, according to data released earlier. Imports also saw a shock drop, falling 7.6% in their biggest decline since July 2016.
The Asian nation, which is the world's second largest economy, is a major source of revenue for many luxury goods firms, which rely on appetite for handbags and jewelery from China's growing middle class.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 06:34AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India likely to overshoot fertilizer aid bill by $4.2 billion, banks may chip in - sources","By Aftab Ahmed and Rajendra Jadhav
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is likely to overshoot its fertilizer subsidy bill for this financial year by 300 billion rupees ($4.2 billion), three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, and the government could tap state banks to fund the extra spending. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government budgeted 700.8 billion rupees for fertilizer subsidies for the 2018/19 year ending March 31, but the sources said nearly half of the money was used to settle dues from the previous year. 
A rise in fertilizer prices overseas and a fall in the rupee currency also made imported fertilizers more expensive, lifting the total subsidy requirement for the year to 1 trillion rupees, the highest ever, the sources said. 
Since the Ministry of Finance denied extra money to the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers for this year, the government is considering a ""special banking arrangement"" for local fertilizer companies, two of the sources said. 
Such a move would be in keeping with other recent financially-draining measure taken by Modi's government to win the support of farmers, small business owners and the less well-off, after the ruling party suffered setbacks in state elections and with a general election due in months. 
The bank route could also help the government meet its decade-low headline fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent of the gross domestic product. 
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India, which has the authority to review state and national budgets, last week criticized the government for increasingly resorting to ""off-budget financing https://cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Report_No_20_of_2018_Compliance_of_the_Fiscal_Responsibility_and_Budget_Management_Act_2003_Department_of_Economic_Affairs_Minis.pdf"" - such as asking banks to fund subsidy gaps - and said such arrangements had ""fiscal implications"". 
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance declined to comment. The fertilizer ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
In the past, too, India has rolled over subsidy requirements by using special arrangements with banks such as  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) or by delaying payments to companies. 
""Considering the poor tax collections, we don't think the government would pay the entire subsidy this year,"" said a senior official with a co-operative fertilizer company, declining to be named or to identify his employer. 
""Like last year, it will be rolled over to the next year."" 
Monthly goods and services tax collection has been averaging below expectation at 967.8 billion rupees since April, compared with an average target of over 1.2 trillion rupees. 
For the next fiscal year the fertilizer ministry has asked for 1 trillion in subsidies from the finance ministry, which will present an interim budget for next fiscal year on Feb. 1, ahead of a general election due by May. 
The Indian government compensates state and private fertilizer companies such as  Coromandel International  Ltd (NS:CORF), Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals Ltd (NS:CHMB), Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (NS:GNFC) and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (NS:RSTC) for selling crop nutrients to the country's millions of farmers at discounted rates.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",Your Money: How Dry January is changing finances,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Next time you go out for a drink with friends, take a look around and see what people are sipping. Instead of Merlot or Rum-and-Coke, you might find a lot more sparkling water.
Welcome to Dry January.
Originally conceived as a public health campaign in the United Kingdom, Dry January asks participants to skip alcohol in the first month of the year. It has gone from 4,000 participants in 2012 to four million in 2018 in the U.K. alone. Now there is a worldwide reach and you can follow along on Twitter (@dryjanuary). 
Research by the University of Sussex in England found lots of benefits: 71 percent of respondents slept better, 70 percent reported improved health, 67 percent had more energy, 58 percent lost weight, 57 percent had better concentration, and 54 percent developed better skin.
But the biggest advantage might be the positive change to bank accounts. The study found that 88 percent of those who participated in Dry January reported saving money as a result.
Just ask Divya Sangam. The 35-year-old New York city public relations rep was living in Singapore when she decided to give Dry January a try in 2012. In a country where all wines are imported and alcohol taxes were high, she could easily drop $150 on booze every time she went out with friends.
She liked the savings so much, that she has not touched booze since. The extra dollars helped pay for her wedding. “That’s how much I was saving,” she marveled.
The no-booze prescription works even if you are not totally successful. Trying and failing still led to positive benefits, University of Sussex researchers found, even though the differences were not as large.
That is what personal finance expert Kristin Wong, author of the new book “Get Money,” found out with her husband. When they gave Dry January a try last year, and went out to dinners in LA, they always asked themselves the exact same thing when the check came: “Why is it so cheap?”
The answer, of course, was the lack of alcohol. “We saved the difference in a small savings account, and then used it to contribute to a road trip to Yosemite later in the year,” Wong said. 
Some advice from others who have gone through Dry January, about how to pull it off successfully – and what comes next:
* Watch out for increased spending in other areas. 
For sure Dry January means you will be spending less on boozy nights out. But if you replace that with shopping or other activities, you will be missing out on potential savings.
New York City’s Megha Desai, president of the nonprofit Desai Foundation, points out that when she paired Dry January with healthier eating habits, the pricier organic food canceled out the financial benefits. So while her health is definitely noticing the difference, her pocketbook is not. “My ginseng tea, that I am replacing alcohol with, is $10 a bottle!” she lamented.
Realize there may be social ramifications. The harsh reality is that not everybody in your social circle may be on board with your choices. That means your usual drinking night might have to be nixed, and your circle may have to change.
“The biggest challenge came with being cut out of some circles, and losing some friendships, because I felt suddenly out of place,” said Sangam. “You are going to have to work through those issues. I suggest finding other activities that don’t involve drinking copious amounts of alcohol, like book clubs or running clubs.”
* Do the math. 
When there are alcohol cravings involved, sticking to a plan like Dry January can be challenging. One trick that can help: Figure how much you are saving, and extrapolate that for an entire year. The whopping figure should supply the extra motivation you need.

That is what Kristin Wong did. “At eight meals out a month, saving $25 a meal on alcohol, that is $2,400 we could save for the year,” she said. “I love having a drink with dinner - but do I really love it $2,400 worth?”

The transaction comes just three months after another blockbuster gold deal when Barrick Gold Corp. agreed to acquire  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. in a $5.4 billion transaction. Today’s deal creates a miner that exceeds Barrick-Randgold in scale, producing about 7.9 million ounces of gold a year.
“This combination will create the world’s leading gold business,” said Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive officer.
Goldcorp shares surged in U.S. pre-market trading, climbing 13 percent to $10.92 as of 5:42 a.m. in New York.
Newmont will pay 0.3280 of its own shares for each Goldcorp share, a premium of 17 percent to the weighted average share price of the companies over the last 20 days. Newmont also plans to pay 2 cents for each Goldcorp share.
Goldberg, who has lead Newmont since 2013, will remain CEO until the deal and integration of the two companies is complete -- likely in the fourth quarter -- after which he will hand over to Chief Operating Officer Tom Palmer.
The new company plans sell up to $1.5 billion in assets over the next 2 years, echoing a similar Barrick pledge to concentrate on the best-performing mines. Newmont also promised initial cost savings from the merger of $100 million a year.
Newmont has retained BMO Capital Markets, Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as financial advisors, while Goldcorp has TD Securities and BofA Merrill Lynch.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>",CapitaLand bets on new markets with $4.4 billion Temasek real estate deal,"By Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's CapitaLand (SI:CATL) is forking out S$6 billion ($4.4 billion) to scoop up logistics and industrial assets from state investor Temasek, in a deal the developer said would create Asia's largest real estate investment manager.
CapitaLand will buy the holding companies of the business of the Ascendas-Singbridge Group, which manages Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust (SI:AEMN),  Ascendas India Trust  (SI:AINT) and  Ascendas Hospitality Trust  (SI:ASHP), for cash and stock. Ascendas-Singbridge also manages private funds.
The transaction, which will give CapitaLand exposure to high-growth technology and e-commerce sectors, marks the biggest consolidation in Singapore's fragmented real estate investment trust sector. Temasek's stake in CapitaLand will rise to about 51 percent after the deal closes from roughly 40.8 percent.
CapitaLand's global businesses span shopping malls, lodging, offices, homes, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and funds. CEO Lee Chee Koon, who took charge in September, has been looking for deals to boost the group's growth.
The Temasek (TEM.UL) deal will help CapitaLand diversify and give it a footing in new markets, analysts said.
""Industrials, which are being driven up due to e-commerce demand, is an area CapitaLand sorely lacked. CapitaLand's retail mall business was also coming under a lot of pressure due to e-commerce,"" said Wong Yew Kiang, an analyst at CLSA.
""Industrial asset class needs scale, you have to buy a big portfolio in one go if you want to make yourself relevant,"" said Wong, adding investors could, however, be worried as the deal was coming when valuations had run up a fair bit and interest rates were set to increase.
The deal with Temasek's subsidiary will add logistics assets and data centers to CapitaLand's portfolio, cushioning it against increased challenges in some segments, including retail and housing in Singapore.
""This deal gives CapitaLand many more options for where growth could come from. This is part of the new CEO's vision of making CapitaLand a more global and diversified player,"" a person familiar with its strategy said.
The enlarged group will have total assets under management of over S$116 billion, making it the ninth biggest global real estate investment manager and just behind UBS Asset Management and CBRE Global Investors, CapitaLand and Ascendas-Singbridge said in a joint statement on Monday.
The deal will push CapitaLand ahead of its target to grow its assets under management to S$100 billion by 2020.
""This particular transaction will give us meaningful scale in key growth markets like India, which brings a lot of promise and excitement,"" CEO Lee said.
In a message to employees for 2019, Lee had cautioned against CapitaLand ""continuing with the status quo"".
""Companies either thrive, survive, or erode, especially in a world that is constantly changing. This is a time when it is dangerous to stay contented,"" he had said.
Temasek will effectively receive about S$6 billion, half in cash and half in new CapitaLand shares as part of the deal.
Temasek's divestment plans come just days after a source said it was in talks to sell a small portion of its 24.9 percent stake in beauty and health retailer A.S. Watson.
J.P. Morgan is the sole financial adviser to CapitaLand.
Trading in shares of CapitaLand and some of its listed REITs, and Ascendas-Singbridge's REITs, was halted ahead of the announcement.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government aims to decide by the end of May whether to complete a deeply divisive high-speed rail link between the French city of Lyon and the northern Italian city of Turin, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli has told Reuters.
Toninelli, a prominent member of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, also said he would not consider a decision to press ahead with the project as a political setback though his party has deeply opposed it for years.
The so-called TAV project is one of Europe's largest infrastructure projects, but Rome called for work to be frozen last year to enable an extensive review of its financial viability.
The issue is putting enormous strain on the ruling coalition because the far-right League wants it built, while Toninelli's 5-Star does not.
League politicians joined at a mass rally in Turin on Saturday to demand that work resume on the link and the row has the potential to split apart the eight-month-old coalition, which is beset by numerous difficulties as the economy approaches what could be its third recession in a decade.
In written answers to questions from Reuters, Toninelli said he believed 5-Star and the League would reach a deal on the TAV, adding that he would not consider it a political defeat if the multi-billion euro project ultimately went ahead.

""If we go ahead it means that it is worth doing it. I will have, myself, checked that people's money is not going to be wasted and therefore I will have done my best,"" he said.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",China says countries should end 'fabrications' about Huawei,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday urged countries to end ""fabrications"" about Huawei, after an official in Poland said his country could limit the use of the company's products by public entities following the arrest of a Huawei employee there on spying allegations.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and U.S.-led allegations that its devices could be used by Beijing for espionage.
No evidence has been produced publicly and Huawei [HWT.UL]has repeatedly denied the accusations, but several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets.
Poland arrested a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on spying allegations on Friday, officials and sources told Reuters.
A Polish government official responsible for cyber security, Karol Okonski, told Reuters on Sunday that ""abrupt"" policy changes toward Huawei were not warranted after the arrests, but that the use of the company's products by state entities could be reviewed. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, responding to the remarks at a regular news briefing in Beijing, said China hoped the Polish side would work to create mutual trust and maintain relations.
Hua said ""some people"" seek to use groundless accusations about security threats to ""suppress and restrict Chinese technology companies' development abroad"".
""We urge relevant parties to cease the groundless fabrications and unreasonable restrictions toward Huawei and other Chinese companies, and create a fair, good and just environment for mutual investment and normal cooperation by both sides' companies,"" Hua said.
""Using security reasons to hype, obstruct or restrict normal cooperation between companies in the end will only hurt one's own interests,"" she added.
Seeking to distance itself from the incident, Huawei said on Saturday it had sacked the employee arrested in Poland, Wang Weijing, adding that his ""alleged actions have no relation to the company.""
A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for Wang showed he has worked for Huawei's Polish division since 2011, and previously served as attache to the Chinese General Consul in Gdansk from 2006-2011. 
A spokesman for the Polish security services said that the allegations related to individual actions, and were not linked directly to Huawei. 
Poland's internal affairs minister, Joachim Brudzinski, has called for the European Union and NATO to work on a joint position over whether to exclude Huawei from their markets.
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government from using Huawei equipment and is considering an executive order that would also ban U.S. companies from doing so.

Australia and New Zealand have also blocked it from building 5G networks amid concerns of its possible links with Beijing.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.6 percent at 0833 GMT, reversing some of last week's gains which saw the index hit a one-month high. The market notched up four straight days of gains, its longest winning streak since November. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) were both down 0.7 percent.
Luxury goods retailers, which rely on appetite for handbags and jewellery from China's burgeoning middle class, bore the brunt of the selling. 
LVMH (PA:LVMH), Hermes (PA:HRMS) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among the biggest fallers in Paris, each down between 1.2 and 2 percent, while Moncler (MI:MONC) in Milan dropped 1.9 percent. On average, one third of the luxury sector is exposed to Chinese demand.
Danish jeweler  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) slumped 7 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600.  Burberry  (L:BRBY) bucked the trend, garnering strength from a BAML upgrade to neutral from underperform.
UK-listed miners (FTNMX1770), which are also exposed to the health of the world's No. 2 economy, were down 0.7 percent.
Gloom across technology stocks (SX8P) returned after chip designer and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) reported fourth-quarter results at the low end of its target range. The shares opened down 2.6 percent.
Around 75 percent of Dialog's business is supplying power-management chips to Apple, which warned in November of slow year-end sales and on Jan. 3 issued its first sales warning in 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 02:29AM ET</span>",China car sales hit reverse for first time since 1990s,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Car makers in China will face more fierce competition this year, after a tough 2018 when the world's biggest auto market contracted for the first time in more than two decades, the country's top auto industry association said on Monday. 
Companies such as homegrown Geely (HK:0175) and Britain's biggest automaker Jaguar Land Rover have already in recent days flagged caution about China sales in 2019, hit also by Beijing's trade war with the United States.
China car sales fell 13 percent in December, the sixth straight month of declines, bringing annual sales to 28.1 million, down 2.8 percent from a year earlier, China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said.
This was against a 3-percent annual growth forecast set at the start of 2018 and is the first time China's auto market has contracted since the 1990s.
China's car market ""still faces relatively large pressures in the short-term"", senior CAAM official Shi Jianhua said at a briefing, attributing the weak 2018 sales to the phasing out of purchase tax cuts on smaller cars and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
CAAM expects the weakness to persist and has forecast flat sales of 28.1 million vehicles for 2019, while other government and industry bodies see a 0-2 percent growth.
For a graphic on monthly auto sales in China in 2018, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Omlt8r
WINNERS & LOSERS
Ford (N:F) was the worst performer among global car makers in China last year, with its sales shrinking 37 percent. 
Geely, China's most successful carmaker, sold 20 percent more cars in 2018, but this was sharply lower than a 63 percent growth in 2017. It is forecasting flat sales this year.
Japan's Toyota Motor (T:7203), however, bucked the trend, with a 14.3 percent rise in sales in China, versus 6 percent growth in 2017, helped by better demand for its luxury brand Lexus and improved marketing efforts.
The bleak numbers add to worries for investors, already spooked by signs of a broader drop in demand from the world's No.2 economy, especially after Apple's (O:AAPL) rare revenue warning citing weak iPhone sales in the country. 
Analysts are, however, counting on measures promised by China to buoy spending as well as rising demand for new energy vehicles (NEVs) to bring some relief. 
NEV sales jumped 61.7 percent in 2018 to 1.3 million units, CAAM said. It sees NEV sales hitting 1.6 million this year.
POLICY BOOST 
China's state planner has said it will introduce policies to lift domestic spending on items such as autos, without providing specifics. Beijing has also made changes to the income tax threshold to hike incomes and personal spending power.
This could help resolve the industry's current issues of unsold inventory, drive sales growth and provide relief to the economic pressures China is facing, said Patrick Yuan, Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies.
""With that, car sales growth could recover to as high as 7 percent"" this year, he said.
According to Alan Kang, an LMC Automotive analyst, demand could also draw support as consumers stop putting their buying decisions on hold in hopes Beijing will reintroduce purchase tax cuts on smaller cars.
As their hopes for tax cuts ""evaporate in 2019"", these consumers will trickle back in, he added.
However, some analysts struck a somber note amid forecasts China's economy would slow further this year. Data this month is expected to show the economy grew around 6.6 percent in 2018 - the weakest since 1990. Policy sources have said Beijing is planning to set a target of 6-6.5 percent for 2019.

""We should notice the big uncertainties among macro economy and trade tensions, which hit the auto market in China last year and may happen again this year,"" said Yale Zhang, head of consultancy AutoForesight.

Okada is engaged in a public spat with Universal, whose board ousted him as chairman in 2017 and accused him of misappropriating $20 million, which the billionaire denied.
Tiger Resort Asia Ltd, Universal's subsidiary, agreed to acquire a majority stake in a Manila listed company in September, paving the way for its own backdoor listing. Tiger owns the operator of the $2.4 billion Okada Manila integrated casino-resort.
""The backdoor listing is not authorized and is opposed by the casino magnate, the true and legal beneficial owner of controlling shares, and Chairman or Sole Director, in all Okada Companies,"" Okada's lawyers said in a January 11 letter to the PSE, which was sent to the media.
The PSE should disallow the backdoor listing because ""there exists, at bare minimum, a serious issue as to whether Fujimoto et. al. are legitimate directors/officers of Tiger, and the rest of the Okada Companies, that can act for and on behalf of said Companies,” the lawyers said, referring to Universal President Jun Fujimoto. 
Officials of the stock exchange, Universal and Tiger were not immediately available for comment. It is a public holiday in Japan on Monday.

A Philippine court earlier this month ordered the arrest of Okada, who is facing fraud charges. In August, he was arrested in Hong Kong because of multiple corruption-related charges and is currently on bail.

(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG) Chief Executive Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB) has stepped down, the company said on Sunday, as pressure from potentially crushing liabilities linked to catastrophic wildfires have pushed the California utility owner to the financial brink and prompted it to make bankruptcy preparations.
Williams, who took the helm of the provider of electricity and natural gas to millions of customers in March 2017, will be replaced by General Counsel John Simon on an interim basis, the company said. She also resigned from the boards of both PG&E and its utility subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
“While we are making progress as a company in safety and other areas, the Board recognizes the tremendous challenges PG&E continues to face. We believe John is the right interim leader for the company,"" PG&E Chairman Richard Kelly said in a statement. ""Our search is focused on extensive operational and safety expertise, and the board is committed to further change at PG&E.""
PG&E is reeling from the November Camp fire that began in the California mountain community of Paradise and swept through the town, eventually killing at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive blaze in state history. 
The company faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially reach $30 billion, according to analyst estimates, when accounting for the carnage and damage from last year's fire and blazes in 2017.
The company is under pressure from the California Public Utilities Commission to make operational changes. The power provider announced on Jan. 3 that it was reviewing its structural options and looking for new directors with safety experience. 
The management shake-up comes as PG&E is in discussions with banks for a multibillion-dollar bankruptcy financing package to aid operations during bankruptcy proceedings and the company prepares to alert employees as soon as Monday to its preparations for a potential Chapter 11 court filing, people familiar with the matter said.
PG&E, which carries a hefty debt load of more than $18 billion, is expected to disclose soon a large financial charge related to liabilities resulting from the November blaze. 
The employee-notification plans are not yet finalized and a communication could come later, the sources said. State law requires PG&E to notify employees at least 15 days before any bankruptcy filing. 
For PG&E, a bankruptcy filing would represent a last resort if the company is unable to get government relief that would allow it to pass on liabilities to customers, a maneuver enacted into law to help the company grapple with 2017 fires, the sources added. California lawmakers have not yet moved to pass legislation that would give PG&E similar flexibility for the 2018 blazes. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom said last week he was having discussions with PG&E executives, and that he wanted a healthy utility investing in environmentally friendly strategies. 
""That's in an ideal world,"" he said. ""That's not the case today."" 
PG&E said in November it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the Camp fire in Northern California. Both Moody's and S&P have cut PG&E's credit rating deeper into junk territory, citing a challenging environment for the power provider related to the wildfires and the need for dramatic intervention from state officials.
Companies negotiate debtor-in-possession loans, often with existing lenders, when they are seriously considering bankruptcy protection so they can continue operations while working through court proceedings. 
PG&E's bankruptcy financing, should it be needed, could total between $3 billion and $5 billion, although the exact figure remains in flux and could end up being higher, said people familiar with the discussions. 
If it seeks bankruptcy protection, the new money could prove critical for PG&E, which spends roughly $6 billion annually.

Futures contracts on the S&P 500 Index fell as much as 0.8 percent as of 10:16 a.m. in Singapore after the gauge closed little changed Friday. Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 Index declined as much as 1 percent, and those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average also slid.
“The U.S. shutdown is now starting to move into a troubling length from an economic perspective,” and most analysts expect weak earnings from banks, said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia in Sydney. “This should see pressure on the U.S. indices as we move through the week.”
Despite the shutdown, U.S. stocks completed a third straight week of gains as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a more dovish stance and expectations of a positive outcome from the trade talks. The S&P 500 has rallied more than 10 percent since hitting the brink of a bear market on Christmas Eve.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). kicks off earnings among major banks on Monday, a litmus test for the sector as analysts became increasingly pessimistic, issuing a slew of cuts to ratings and price targets earlier this month.

Also front in investors minds is the brewing economic impact of the partial government shutdown that became the longest in the modern era on Saturday and shows no signs of abating. About 800,000 federal workers missed their pay for the first time Friday.
Trump and the Democrats remain at loggerheads over the president’s demand for a border wall funding. While the president hasn’t ruled out declaring a national emergency to end the impasse, his budget team is drawing up contingency plans for a shutdown that extends through the end of February, according to an administration official.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",Australia's Westpac says banks may face problems hitting new capital targets,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's big banks may struggle to raise the amount of extra capital they require under new rules proposed by the country's banking regulator, a senior executive at Westpac Banking Corporation (AX:WBC) said in an interview published on Monday.
The mooted requirements, which the country's four largest lenders said would mean they need to raise between A$67 billion and A$83 billion over four years ($48 billion to $60 billion) are sound in principle but tough to achieve, Westpac treasurer Curt Zuber told the Australian Financial Review newspaper. 
""As we go through cycles, it is potentially problematic for the banks to get the volumes they need in an economic way for the system which allows for the balance we want to achieve,"" he said.
The comments signal the first public push-back from the banks since the proposal - the third such request in as many years - was announced by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) last November.
It also comes as the sector braces for tougher scrutiny after a scathing public inquiry into the finance industry uncovered widespread bad behavior and mismanagement.
""It is a big number ... the market as it stands today is not big enough to cope with that level of issues,"" said Morningstar banking analyst David Ellis.
""But as the banks continue to raise tier 2 bonds, their balance sheets become stronger as far as the buyers are concerned,"" he said, adding that overall it would probably increase funding costs only modestly.
APRA said it wants the country's four biggest lenders to raise their available capital by 4 to 5 percentage points by 2023 from the current 14.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets.
The buffer would bring Australian banks in line with new international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and adopted by Canada and European Union countries, APRA said 
Banks could use any form of capital to meet the higher requirements, although APRA anticipated the most economical way to source it would be Tier 2 subordinated debt capital. It is seeking feedback from the lenders until Feb. 8.
National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) head of group funding Eva Zileli told the Financial Review that would make Australian banks one of the largest issuers of tier 2 debt globally.
The bank had no further comment when contacted by Reuters. Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and APRA had no comment.

1082,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",PG&E CEO to Leave With Utility at Brink of Bankruptcy,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. Chief Executive Officer Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB) is leaving as California’s largest utility owner nears potential bankruptcy.
The San Francisco-based company has begun a search for a new CEO following Williams’ departure, according to a statement issued Sunday. PG&E general counsel John Simon will take the helm in the meantime. Williams, 57, took over as CEO in March 2017 and is leaving after a catastrophic three months for PG&E.
The company has seen two-thirds of its market value wiped out since November’s Camp Fire -- the deadliest wildfire in California’s history. Its debt has been downgraded to junk and state regulators have called for a management shakeup. Investigators have been probing whether the power giant’s equipment ignited the fire, along with its potential liability for blazes that devastated Northern California’s wine country in 2017 -- costs that may tally as much as $30 billion.
Williams couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Sunday.
The company’s deepening financial crisis has forced California regulators and policy makers to consider a bailout package and PG&E is weighing whether to file for bankruptcy. The utility is planning to notify employees as soon as Monday that it may make a Chapter 11 filing within 15 days, people familiar with the plan said Saturday. Such a notice would be required by state law.
The departure of Williams -- one of the world’s most powerful women in business -- thins the ranks of the roughly two dozen women running S&P 500 companies. She was one of a group of women occupying the C-suite at power companies -- including  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK).’s Lynn Good, El Paso Electric Co.’s Mary Kipp, PNM Resources Inc.’s Pat Vincent-Collawn and Sunrun Inc.’s Lynn Jurich.
The daughter of Cuban political refugees, Williams became the nation’s first Latina CEO of a Fortune 500 company when she took over PG&E. Her departure follows the exit of three PG&E executives earlier this month -- Patrick Hogan, senior vice president of electric operations at PG&E’s utility unit; Kevin Dasso, vice president of electric asset management; and Gregg Lemler, vice president of electric transmission.
Under Williams, PG&E spent millions of dollars trying to convince state lawmakers to change a legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation, under which utilities are liable for damages if their equipment is found to have sparked a wildfire, even if they weren’t negligent. Williams called the doctrine bad public policy that made utilities the default insurer in the state. She said the wildfires were a symptom of climate change with hotter and drier conditions sparking more frequent and intense blazes.
While state lawmakers rejected PG&E’s request to change wildfire liability law, they did pass legislation in August that will help PG&E pay for lawsuits arising from the wine country fires. Three months later, however, the utility’s equipment again was being looked at as a possible source of the Camp Fire, which killed 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.
Support for PG&E’s management eroded even further in December when state regulators accused the utility of falsifying records related to locating and marking underground gas lines from 2012 through 2017 -- years in which the company was trying to convince the public that it had cleaned up its act after a 2010 pipeline blast that killed eight in San Bruno, California.
The disclosure prompted a key state lawmaker, Bill Dodd, a state senator from Napa who helped draft the fire legislation that was helpful to PG&E, to call for a management shakeup at the company.
“Enough is enough,” Dodd said.

The trade data could provide markets further insight on the state of the Chinese economy. Recent economic data, including the latest official and Caixin PMI numbers reported earlier in January, suggested a slowdown in China.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.5% and 0.7% respectively by 8:40 PM ET (01:40 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.6%.
Meanwhile, reports that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) delayed market entry for Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) received some focus.
The central bank has not formally acknowledged their submissions even they submitted applications to the central bank more than a year ago, the Financial Times reported citing two people familiar with the application process.
The situation could cause trouble in future trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, the report added.
“One could suspect that it’s because of the trade war, but then again  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) was approved. Somebody said, ‘Well Amex is smaller, so there’s less impact to the market,’ but nobody really knows,” said one of the people. “There are a lot of variables. We are communicating with the central bank on and off, but there’s no clear reason.”
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.7%. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 slipped 0.2%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was closed for a public holiday.
In other news, the U.S. government shutdown, now in its 24th day, continued with no resolution in sight. Meanwhile, the U.K.’s vote for a deal for its departure from the European Union is due on Tuesday.

The figures reflected the impact of escalating trade and political friction between Washington and Beijing. After taking divestitures into account, net Chinese FDI flows into the United States actually turned negative.
Investment into the United States fell by 83 percent but, by contrast, grew by 80 percent into Canada. In Europe, despite an overall decline, Chinese FDI into countries like Germany, France and Spain also actually grew.
Completed Chinese FDI deals in the two Western regions fell to $30 billion in 2018 from $111 billion the year before, Baker & McKenzie said in a report prepared with research firm Rhodium Group.
Even after stripping out the effect of the $43 billion takeover of Syngenta by ChemChina in 2017, the underlying drop in deal volumes was 40 percent.
Tougher regulatory scrutiny also led to the cancellation of 14 Chinese investment deals in North America, with a combined value of $4 billion, and seven in Europe worth $1.5 billion.
""Some deals are still getting done despite new investment screening regulations, trade tensions and Chinese investment controls,"" said Michael DeFranco, global head of M&A at Baker McKenzie.

""But all parties in a prospective transaction need to conduct plenty of due diligence and take in-depth regulatory advice to assess if a deal is viable.""

Les Echos said that Nissan and Mitsubishi in June 2017 set up joint venture Nissan Mitsubishi BV (NMBV) in the Netherlands to pay bonuses to staff and managers of the two carmakers.
The JV's top directors were not initially supposed to receive bonuses from the unit but in February 2018 -- and without the knowledge of other directors -- Ghosn was hired as an employee by the unit, which made him eligible for payments, the paper reported.
A Nissan spokesman did not immediately respond to a request from comment. 
Ghosn has been detained in Japan since his arrest on Nov. 19 and faces charges including under-reporting of his income for the five years through 2015. He denied those charges at a court appearance last week.
Reuters last week reported that one of Ghosn's senior executives received an additional six-figure salary via the Dutch joint venture overseeing Renault's alliance with Nissan. There is nothing to suggest that the payments were illegal, but they highlight governance issues and potential conflicts of interest.

1088,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>",Why the Fed and Markets Don’t Agree on Interest-Rate Prospects,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Markets have had a full week to digest the very strong U.S. jobs report, as well as signs of progress in the China-U.S. trade talks. Yet despite the positive news, investors and traders believe the Federal Reserve will stop hiking interest rates this year and will cut them in both 2020 and 2021. The discrepancy between the markets’ interest rate view and the positive jobs report, and how this difference is eventually resolved, have important implications for investment strategies in the New Year.
The blowout employment report released Jan. 4 showed that the U.S. economy created 312,000 jobs in December, almost twice consensus expectations. Adding to signs of a strong labor market, the previous two months' readings were revised upward and wage growth rose to 3.2 percent, suggesting that the household sector, the main driver of growth in the U.S. economy, is strong. This positive sign for consumption would normally encourage companies to boost output and capacity, adding to the growth impetus. In addition, the budget approved by the previous Congress contains continued fiscal stimulus for this year.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries moved up from their depressed levels at the market close on Jan. 3, the day before the release of the jobs reports. The 2-year bond rose to 2.54 percent on Jan. 11 from 2.38 percent, and the 10-year to just over 2.70 percent from under 2.60 percent. Yet overall levels remain relatively low given the strength of the labor market data. Moreover, the difference between these two maturities, historically regarded as a signal of growth prospects, remains at a worrisome low level of 16 basis points.
The contrast between the implied market pricing for the fed funds rate and the central bank’s “blue dots” is also notable. The markets, anticipating no hikes this year and cuts thereafter, estimate the fed funds rate in 2020 a full percentage point below the median of the central bank's dots.
Several reasons have been put forward to explain this striking and consequential difference. They include the following six (which aren't mutually exclusive):
Determining which of these six main explanations, alone or in combination, is the most valid really matters for investors’ portfolio positioning. For example, the first scenario (structural upside to the U.S. economy) would imply considerable secular risk taking and tolerance for volatility given that fundamentals would drive the economy and markets forward and wouldn't be derailed by premature Fed tightening. The second explanation (the Fed cowed by markets) would suggest a more tactical risk positioning, which involves surfing the central-bank liquidity wave once again but being ready to get off before it breaks. The other possibilities suggest up-in-quality trades and more defensive investment positioning.
As frustrating as this is, there simply isn’t enough data as yet to point with a high degree of confidence to a dominating explanation or combination of explanations. In addition, most model portfolios and, more generally, historically based analytical models may not be sufficiently structurally robust to capture this moment accurately.
Rather than let this uncertainty lead to either paralysis or excessive speculation about the influence of one or more tentative explanations, investors should take away three messages: We are in a period of inherently greater economic, policy and financial uncertainty, instability and unpredictability; the main risks to the U.S. economy are less organic than political, external and financial; and the risks of a policy mistake and/or market accident are increasing. All of this calls for well-constructed tail protection and readily available cash to exploit the possibility of subsequent technical overshoots."

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Sears has survived the Great Depression and world wars. Whether the 126-year-old retailer stays afloat or goes out of business now hinges in part on paying for the enormous bill piled up by going broke.
The fate of Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) highlights a harsh reality of U.S. bankruptcy - it requires armies of pricey specialists in a system driven by an outcome, not costs.
On Monday, Sears will consider bids for its assets, including a last-ditch $5 billion proposal by chairman and controlling shareholder Eddie Lampert.
To ensure his chances of outbidding proposals to liquidate the chain, Lampert last week agreed to assume more than $600 million in additional liabilities that Sears has incurred since filing for bankruptcy protection last October.
Those so-called administrative claims includes taxes, and payments to vendors and the professionals advising Sears. 
    ""The fees in a case like this will be tremendous, you've got people working round the clock,"" said David Wander, bankruptcy attorney at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron. ""A massive case requires a massive amount of legal talent.""
Sears, which also owns the Kmart discount chain, is picking up the tab for six law firms, three investment banks, two financial advisers and seven others that are providing tax, real estate advice and other services, according to court filings.
Although the final tally will not be known until the case ends, the fees mount quickly.
The law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, for example, billed Sears about $5 million for the first two weeks after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 15, according to court documents.
Weil did not respond to a request for comment. Sears declined to comment.
Bankruptcy veterans said the fees reflect the realities of Chapter 11, which can inflate costs: only a handful of law firms can put scores of experienced staff on a case on short notice. Corporate leaders are happy to pay top dollar when the company's survival is on the line.
The 2008 bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc has been the costliest case by far, surpassing $2 billion, and large failures such as Enron Corp in 2001 typically run up bills of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Since lawyers and other advisers generally get paid first, critics such as academics often blame their fees for reducing the amount left for creditors and employees.
The rising cost of Chapter 11 also reflects increasingly complicated corporate structures, and the sometimes convoluted financial dealings that a struggling company might undertake to avoid failure.
For example, Sears struck a series of refinancing deals with Lampert, which will now be investigated by a special restructuring committee of the board.
The committee will get its own set of lawyers and advisers to avoid potential conflicts of interest, piling on costs.
In addition, Sears will also pay for professionals for an official unsecured creditors committee, which is typical. 
At least 36 lawyers are billing Sears $1,000 or more an hour, according to court filings.
Of course, high hourly rates could be worth it. American Airlines and General Motors (NYSE:GM) arguably thrived thanks to bankruptcy, although retailers in particular tend to perish in Chapter 11.
Legal experts say that comparing the cost of Chapter 11 cases is nearly impossible because of the large number of variables in each case. 
""I’m not sure we really know what a large chapter 11 case should cost, so its hard to 'control' fees unless they are extreme,"" said Stephen Lubben, a professor at Seton Hall Law School.
Toys ""R"" Us in its first three months piled up more $45 million in fees, according to court records. The retailer, which went out of business after filing for bankruptcy in 2017, has paid 72 firms $375 million through December.
Judges have ordered fee examiners to hunt for unnecessary charges in the enormous fee statements - Weil's for the first two weeks of Sears ran 330 pages, breaking down each lawyers' time into six-minute intervals.
Lynn LoPucki, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, called fee examiners mere window dressing on a broken system.
He said judges should require evidence from firms that they charge the same rates for clients in or out of bankruptcy.

""Most lawyers would tell you bankruptcy is a highly profitable practice,"" he said.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 02:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: PG&E talking to banks on multibillion dollar bankruptcy financing - sources,"By Mike Spector and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG) is in discussions with investment banks about a multibillion-dollar financing package to help navigate bankruptcy proceedings, a sign that Chapter 11 filing preparations are intensifying in the wake of potentially staggering liabilities from deadly wildfires, sources said on Sunday. 
The California utility owner is in touch with large banks about so-called debtor-in-possession financing that could total between $3 billion and $5 billion, though the exact figure remains in flux and could end up being higher, said the sources, who are familiar with the matter.
PG&E Corp declined to comment. 
The company may alert employees as soon as Monday about its preparations for a potential bankruptcy filing in compliance with a state law about providing notice at least 15 days before such an event, one of the people said.
The plans have not been finalized and the communication could come later, the source said. Bloomberg first reported that the notice could come as soon as Monday. 
Companies negotiate debtor-in-possession loans, often with existing lenders, when they are seriously considering bankruptcy protection so they can continue operations while working through court proceedings.
PG&E's existing lenders include  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC).
A bankruptcy filing is not assured, the sources said. PG&E's discussions with banks about financing are in the early stages and part of contingency planning if other efforts to address woes from last year's wildfire fail, they said. 
A bankruptcy filing would represent a last resort if the company is unable to get government relief that would allow it to pass on liabilities to customers, a maneuver enacted into law to help the company grapple with 2017 fires, the sources added. 
If it seeks bankruptcy protection, the new money could prove critical for PG&E, which spends roughly $6 billion annually serving millions of electric and natural gas customers in California.
PG&E, which carries a hefty debt load of more than $18 billion, is expected to soon disclose a large financial charge related to liabilities resulting from catastrophic November blazes. One, the Camp Fire, swept through the mountain community of Paradise and killed at least 86 people, the deadliest and most destructive blaze in state history. 

PG&E faces widespread lawsuits from that fire and one in 2017. In November, the company warned it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage it its equipment was found to have caused last year's blazes.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Samsung (KS:005930) plans to launch a budget smartphone series in India ahead of a global release, aiming to regain ground ceded to Chinese rivals such as  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) in the world's second-biggest mobile phone market.
The South Korean company's Indian market share by shipments has lagged Xiaomi's in two of the three 2018 quarters for which data is available, according to technology researcher Counterpoint.
The three new M-series phones, which Samsung plans to sell only through its website and Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Indian operation, will help the company to double online sales, the head of Samsung's Indian mobile business told Reuters.
""The M series has been built around and incepted around Indian millennial consumers,"" Asim Warsi said, adding that the phones will be rolled out globally after the Indian launch at the end of January.
He declined to give specifics but said that online sales account for a double-digit percentage of the company's overall mobile phone revenue.
Samsung's mobile phone sales in India touched 373.5 billion rupees ($5.3 billion) in the 12 months to end-March 2018, according to regulatory filings sourced by paper.vc, a business intelligence platform.
The India-made phones, priced from less than 10,000 rupees ($141.80) up to 20,000 rupees, will carry chunkier batteries and features such as quick charging, Warsi said.
Samsung has been sharpening its focus on India, home to more than a billion wireless subscribers and where roughly 350 million users still do not use smartphones.
Last year it opened what it said was the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Indian capital New Delhi as well as its biggest mobile phone store globally in Bengaluru.
""A lot of our insights, R&D and developments for consumers in India ... they have great connect with many other consumers in many other parts of the world,"" Warsi said. 
Samsung's Indian business sells its phones through 250,000 retail outlets and more than 2,000 exclusive stores, with support offered by 2,000 service centers.

Deutsche Bahn management is holding a crisis meeting with Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Tuesday to discuss the situation at the state-owned rail company that has come under fire from passengers and politicians for falling punctuality.
However, the source said there were differences of opinion among politicians and the company's supervisory board over the idea of selling Arriva and no decisions are expected on Tuesday.
Deutsche Bahn declined to comment.
Government officials who are members of the Deutsche Bahn board have repeatedly voiced scepticism about plans to privatize Arriva and its Schenker logistics arm.
The Handelsblatt newspaper, which first reported the plan, said that a complete sale of Arriva could raise between 4 billion and 4.5 billion euros.

Reuters' source said that Arriva, which is headquartered in Britain and does most of its business there, was hard to value because of the country's plan to leave the EU at the end of March.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland could consider banning the use of Huawei products by public bodies, a senior government official said on Sunday, following the arrest of a Chinese Huawei official in the east European country last week.
The Polish government could also look to tighten legislation to allow the authorities to limit the availability of products made by any company deemed to pose a threat to security.
Poland arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations, officials and sources told Reuters on Friday, a move that could fuel Western security concerns about the telecoms equipment maker.
A government official who is responsible for cyber security told Reuters ""abrupt"" policy changes towards Huawei were not warranted after the arrests.
But he said the use of the company's products by state entities could be reviewed.
""We will analyze whether ... our decision can include an end to the use ... of Huawei products,"" Karol Okonski told Reuters.
""We do not have the legal means to force private companies or citizens to stop using any IT company's products. It cannot be ruled out that we will consider legislative changes that would allow such a move,"" he added. 
A spokesman for Poland's security services said on Friday the Polish official arrested by the country's Internal Security Agency (ISA) had been responsible for issuing security certificates for equipment used by public administration.
""(He) used to work for a number of public institutions, held important managerial positions and was also connected with ... institutions that protect internal security,"" he told public broadcaster TVP.
Seeking to distance itself from the incident, Huawei said on Saturday it had sacked its employee, adding his ""alleged actions have no relation to the company.""
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and U.S.-led allegations that its devices could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the accusations, but several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets.
Poland's internal affairs minister, Joachim Brudzinski, called for the European Union and NATO to work on a joint position over whether to exclude Huawei from their markets.

""We are examining the readiness of the (EU and NATO) countries to work on a joint position,"" Okonski told Reuters referring to the new generation of 5G telecoms infrastructure.

The EU watchdog is set to decide by Feb.18 whether to approve the merger, with French newspaper Les Echos reporting that the European Commission was likely to veto the merger, which would create a Franco-German rail champion.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said the German competition body had written a confidential letter to its EU counterpart stressing concerns about the planned deal and saying it completely shares the Commission's reservations.
The German body said it did not believe that the recent pledges of both companies removed those competitive concerns, the paper cited the letter as saying.
The merger was designed to create a European champion to challenge the advance of China's state-owned CRRC (SS:601766) and Canada's Bombadier Transportation (TO:BBDb).
However, four other national regulators expressed their reservations about the merger in December, saying the two firms fell far short of addressing concerns over their deal.
The concerns over how the merger would affect competition center around the supply of very high-speed rolling stock for trains such as the Eurostar which links Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Germany has warned companies involved in the construction of the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that they could face sanctions if they stick to the project, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a ""captive"" of Moscow due to its reliance on Russian energy and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion gas pipeline.
The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is also seen critical by other European countries as it would deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees which could make Kiev more vulnerable in the future.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell addressed the issue in a letter sent to several companies, the U.S. Embassy said.
""The letter reminds that any company operating in the Russian energy export pipeline sector is in danger under CAATSA of U.S. sanctions,"" the embassy spokesman said, adding that other European states also opposed the planned pipeline.
Germany and other European allies accuse Washington of using its Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) to meddle in their foreign and energy policies due to its extraterritorial effect.
Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) is implementing the project jointly with its Western partners - Uniper (DE:UN01), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Engie (PA:ENGIE), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and Anglo-Dutch group Shell (AS:RDSa).
The letter raised eyebrows within the German government. A German diplomat said the ambassador's approach did not correspond to common diplomatic practice and that Berlin would address the issue in direct talks with officials in Washington.
An Uniper spokesman declined to comment while no immediate reaction was available from Wintershall.
Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route.
German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which was first to report on the letter, said that Grenell was trying to blackmail German companies with the letter. The U.S. Embassy denied this.
""The only thing that could be considered blackmail in this situation would be the Kremlin having leverage over future gas supplies,"" the embassy spokesman said.
The letter was coordinated in Washington by several U.S. government agencies and ""is not meant to be a threat but a clear message of U.S. policy"", the spokesman added.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday that any U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute and that questions of European energy policy had to be decided in Europe, not in the United States.

The KBA has opened an investigation into whether a software update for 1.2-litre engine cars, including the popular Polo, enabled them to cheat emissions tests, the newspaper said, without naming its sources.
The Bild am Sonntag said prosecutors were preparing charges against unnamed Volkswagen managers for suspected fraud, noting that the company had given assurances in 2016 that the 1.2 liter engines did not use illegal emissions cheating defeat devices.
VW has had to recall hundreds of thousands of cars around the world since it admitted in Sept. 2015 to installing illegal software in diesel engines to cheat strict U.S. anti-pollution tests.
The KBA was considering forcing 30,000 affected cars in Germany off the road, although it was more likely just to order further remedial work, the newspaper said. There are 370,000 of the models under investigation in Europe in total.
Germany's Transport Ministry, which oversees the KBA, said it was aware of the allegations, but noted that the KBA's investigation was not yet concluded.
A Volkswagen spokesman said internal quality controls for diesel cars with 1.2 liter engines, model EA189, had revealed irregularities which were now being analyzed.

He said Volkswagen had informed the authorities and the company was in continuous dialogue with them.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The surprise outcome of Congo's election - a vote meant to bring closure to years of turmoil under President Joseph Kabila - has done little to ease uncertainty for miners and investors in a country crucial to the electric vehicle revolution.
Democratic Republic of Congo is the world's leading miner of cobalt, a mineral used in electric car batteries which has seen a surge in demand in recent years, with mines run by firms including  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and China Molybdenum (SS:603993).
Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi, an unknown quantity for mining executives, was declared the winner of last month's chaotic vote on Thursday, defeating Kabila's chosen successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.
The stakes for mining firms are high. In a study last year, McKinsey forecast a 60 percent increase in demand for cobalt by 2025, and cited uncertainty in Congolese government policy as one of the major risks to supply.
""It could be that, as a mining sector, we're worse off than when we were under Kabila,"" said one mining operator, who asked not to be identified. ""There may be some improvements, but we're not counting on it.""
Tshisekedi's supporters hailed the election result as the end of nearly two decades of corrupt rule under Kabila. But the outcome has quickly come under question, and the extent to which Kabila will continue to wield influence over the economy through sprawling patronage networks remains unclear.
""It's going to be an extremely volatile period,"" said Jason Stearns, director of New York University’s Congo Research Group. ""If I were a savvy investor, I'd look at Congo and just step back for six months.""
Tshisekedi has little political track record for investors to judge.
Few companies had expected him to win, one industry source said, and had focused attention on Martin Fayulu, another opposition leader and ally of the former governor of Congo’s mining region, Moise Katumbi. They fear that strategy could now hurt relations with the new president, the source said.
Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, has historically favored an important state role in mining and opposed the privatization of state assets. But in what appeared an olive branch to mining firms, Tshisekedi said on the campaign trail that he would take a second look at a new mining code introduced last year.
Relations between miners and the government hit a nadir over the code, signed into law in March, which raised royalty rates across the board. But even under Tshisekedi, the prospect of a rethink is slim, said Elisabeth Caesens, director of Resource Matters, which advocates for better natural resource governance.
""Increasing taxes on multinationals was way too popular a move to easily turn back,"" she said.
TURF WARS?
Five mining executives contacted by Reuters said they were not yet operating on the assumption that Tshisekedi's win would be validated by the Kabila-appointed Constitutional Court and expected the outgoing president to fight to keep his stranglehold on the sector. None wanted to speak on the record.
Companies could find themselves caught in the crossfire of turf wars over ministry jobs and positions in the bureaucracy, not knowing who is really in charge.
""There are always people you have to sway if you want a contract or a mining permit,"" Stearns said. ""At the top, these are Kabila's people. That's now going to be in a state of flux that, I think, is going to last months.""
Even if Tshisekedi's win is validated, Kabila's influence is unlikely to disappear.
Supporters of Fayulu, who was declared runner-up, allege Tshisekedi's victory grew from a backroom power-sharing deal struck with Kabila and are challenging the result in court. Tshisekedi and Kabila’s camps deny any such deal.
A Catholic Church observer mission concluded Fayulu was the clear victor, diplomats briefed on its findings said. Belgium and France also questioned the result.
Kabila's allies retain a parliamentary majority, and with it the right to name the prime minister, according to results announced on Saturday, making it unclear who will control key posts. While the president formally appoints ministers, those names are proposed by the prime minister.
""You wield power in Congo via the power of appointment, and what I'll be looking at is who gets put where,"" said Gregory Mthembu-Salter, a former U.N. sanctions monitor in Congo who now heads Phuzumoya Consulting, which advises on due diligence and supply chains. 
PATRONAGE NETWORKS
Despite the political uncertainty, Congo's mineral wealth remains a draw for mining firms. As well as its cobalt reserves, it is Africa's biggest copper producer and also mines gold and diamonds.
A day after the election results were announced, companies announced two mining transactions which could help bring concessions into production.
Australia’s Vector Resources (AX:VEC) acquired a 60 percent stake in the Adidi-Kanga Gold project in Ituri province. And AIM-listed Armadale Capital (L:ACPA) sold its Mpokoto gold project to Arrow Mining and African Royalty.
A source involved in the Adidi-Kanga transaction said that government approvals for the deal were secured long before the election. Communications consultants for Armadale said work on the Mpokoto deal began in 2016. 
Tshisekedi will need a functioning mining sector to raise revenues and, importantly, ensure the army is paid. Clawing revenue streams back from Kabila's patronage networks would help consolidate his position, as would improving governance to help attract new investors.
Under Kabila, Congo lost at least $1.36 billion in potential revenues from 2010-2012 alone due to cut-price asset sales to offshore companies, according to a panel led by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Campaigners say the trend has continued.
A review of the most controversial deals of the past decades could also help Tshisekedi prove to the Congolese people that he's his own man, analysts said.
""Maybe Tshisekedi will set out and try to clean things up,"" said Ryan Cummings, director of business intelligence firm Signal Risk. ""But I'm not sure I'd put any money on it.""

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Investment Authority aims to raise investments in the United States to $45 billion in the next two years as it rebalances its portfolio of assets away from Europe, its chief executive said on Sunday. 
The sovereign wealth fund has built up a huge European portfolio through stakes in companies including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
QIA currently has about $30 billion invested in the U.S., Mansour Ibrahim al-Mahmoud told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
""We are talking about $45 billion for the U.S. market..we are on track for this over the next two years,"" he said. 
Mahmoud's predecessor Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohamed bin Saud al-Thani in 2015 committed to invest $45 billion in the U.S. over a five-year period.
""Our objective is to balance our portfolio...currently we have a little bit of concentration in Europe and having this allocation toward the US market is to balance the portfolio,"" he said.
In the U.S., QIA was looking at fundamental sectors such as real estate, technology or U.S. exchanges, he said.
In one such U.S. deal, QIA and hedge fund Elliott Management Corp in December 2017 took Gigamon Inc, the U.S. networking software company, private for $1.6 billion.
Mahmoud was speaking as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Qatar on a tour of the region.
Qatar is at loggerheads with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt, which have cut off diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of backing terrorism and cosying up to Iran.
Qatar denies supporting terrorism and its government is seeking to use the sanctions enforced by its neighbors as an opportunity to develop its own industry and its relations with other countries.
The value of bilateral trade between Qatar and the U.S. has doubled in 10 years, Qatar's trade minister Ali al-Kuwairi said at the U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue conference. He said the U.S. tops the list of exporters to the Gulf nation.
Kuwari said bilateral trade volume reached $6 billion in the period from January to October last year. 
The minister didn't give the equivalent figure the previous year but this would be higher than the value for all of 2017, which was about $4.3 billion in bilateral trade, according to the United States Census Bureau.

The news sent shares of Aeronautics up 37 percent in morning trade in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Aeronautics rejected a 430 million shekel offer from Rafael and Stolero last August.
Aeronautics, which had a market value of 507 million shekels on Jan. 10, said the latest offer for all its shares would be done as a reverse merger executed through a company jointly owned by Rafael and Stolero.
The company would become private and its shares delisted from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
Aeronautics said it had agreed to hold talks with the potential buyers and committed to giving them exclusivity. Negotiations will take place until Feb. 15, during which time Rafael will conduct due diligence.
Earlier this month, state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries [ISRAI.UL] said it was in early talks to invest in Aeronautics.
In 2017, Aeronautics said the Defence Ministry had suspended the marketing and export license for one of the firm's attack drones to a significant customer in a foreign country. The company denied any wrongdoing.
Israeli media reported at the time that the ministry had opened an investigation into Aeronautics over whether during a product demonstration in Azerbaijan one of its drones was used to attack a military position in the neighboring country of Armenia, and if so, who was at fault.

Aeronautics manufactures unmanned aerial vehicles for military surveillance and defense purposes, as well as for the commercial sector.

Pledging to introduce more services for small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in cross-border trade between the United States and China, executives from the branch said payment in yuan would be possible by tapping new functions of e-MPay, a cross-border payment system launched by the branch in 2016. 
The branch is developing a system using an existing platform to ""facilitate trade finance for e-commerce players,"" said Xu Chen, president and chief executive officer of Bank of China USA, Xinhua reported, without providing further details.
The system will adhere to U.S. anti-money laundering rules through artificial intelligence and cyber security technologies, Xu added.
Bank of China has run into problems with overseas anti-money laundering regulations in the past. In February 2017, it agreed to pay a 600,000 euro ($688,000) fine to settle a case involving its Milan branch. Prosecutors had alleged more than 4.5 billion euros was smuggled to China from Italy between 2006 and 2010.

HONG KONG/WARSAW (Reuters) - Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei said on Saturday it had sacked an employee arrested in Poland on spying charges in a case that could intensify Western security concerns about the company.
Poland's internal affairs minister, Joachim Brudzinski, called for the European Union and NATO to work on a joint position over whether to exclude Huawei from their markets following the arrest of the Chinese employee and a former Polish security official on Friday.
The two men have heard the charges and could be held for three months.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and U.S.-led allegations that its devices could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the accusations, but several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets. 
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government from using Huawei equipment and is considering an executive order that would also ban U.S. companies from doing so.
Brudzinski said Poland wanted to continue cooperating with China but that a discussion was needed on whether to exclude Huawei from some markets.
""There are concerns about Huawei within NATO as well. It would make most sense to have a joint stance, among EU member states and NATO members,"" he told private broadcaster RMF FM.
""We want relations with China that are good, intensive and attractive for both sides,"" he added.
HUAWEI DISTANCES ITSELF FROM ARRESTS
Seeking to distance itself from the incident, Huawei said in a statement it had sacked Wang Weijing, whose ""alleged actions have no relation to the company.""
""In accordance with the terms and conditions of Huawei's labor contract, we have made this decision because the incident has brought Huawei into disrepute,"" the statement said.
""Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, and we require every employee to abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they are based,"" the company's statement added.
A Huawei spokesman, Joe Kelly, declined to give any further details.
A spokesman for the Polish security services had told Reuters the allegations related to individual actions, and were not linked directly to Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd.
A deputy digital affairs minister in Poland said, however, that Warsaw was analyzing any involvement by Huawei in building the country's 5G telecommunications infrastructure, Money.pl portal reported.
Any decision by Western governments over whether to exclude Huawei from their markets would have to consider the possible impact on the speed and cost of 5G development, analysts say.
""My best-case outcome is that Europe uses this window of opportunity and figures out how to have a minimal risk for the best network possible,"" said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, an IT security expert at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin-based think-tank.
A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for Wang showed he has worked for Huawei's Polish division since 2011 and previously served as attache to the Chinese General Consul in Gdansk from 2006-2011. Wang did not immediately respond to a request for comment via the social media site.
China's Foreign Ministry has expressed concern over the case and is urging Poland to handle the case ""justly.""
In a statement on Saturday, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Poland said the embassy had met with the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs over the detention of a Chinese citizen and had requested that the Chinese side is briefed on the matter and consular visits be arranged as soon as possible.
China resolutely opposes ""deliberate smearing"" and ""unwarranted fabrication"" with no factual basis, the statement added, without specifying what it was referring to. 

The embassy will fully protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, the spokesperson said.

Shipley was ""a critical force behind what is now JPMorgan Chase,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a note to employees. He died on Friday, Dimon said.
The company did not provide details on Shipley's death.
Shipley served as chairman and chief executive of both Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, Dimon said, and retired in 1999, the year before Chase acquired J.P. Morgan.
Over four decades, he helped to orchestrate mergers with Texas Commerce Bank in 1987, Manufacturers Hanover in 1991 and Chase Manhattan Bank in 1995.
""Walter had a vision of where the banking industry was going, and he had the courage and ability to act,"" former Chase CEO Bill Harrison said in a statement.
Born the son of a Wall Street investment banker in Newark, New Jersey, Shipley was forced to leave Williams (NYSE:WMB) College due to poor grades. The six-foot, eight-inch former basketball captain subsequently had to work and pay for his education, and attended night school determined to prove himself to his family, the bank said in an obituary.
Dimon said Shipley was widely respected as a ""straight shooter"" who fostered an open, entrepreneurial meritocracy.
He is survived by five children, seven grandchildren, two siblings and a companion, the bank said.

1109,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Russia Eyes Island Storage for Arctic LNG Amid China Demand Boom,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s Novatek PJSC is looking at storing liquefied natural gas produced in the Arctic on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu so it can better meet spot demand from China and cut shipping costs.
Saibu Gas Co., which last month signed a preliminary deal to allow Russia’s biggest LNG producer to use its storage facilities, said Wednesday it may build two additional LNG tanks and upgrade its re-exporting capability. That infrastructure would offer Novatek greater flexibility to meet Chinese and South Korean demand and cut freight costs, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
“Given its LNG sources are very far from Asia, storage and re-loading will enable it to capture shorter-term arbitrage opportunities,” said Nicholas Browne, an analyst with the energy consultant in Singapore. “Keeping gas in storage could ultimately reduce its costs in supplying Asian markets” because shipping is more expensive from the Arctic when ice cover increases.
The ability to meet spot LNG demand in China may grow in importance as the Asian nation ramps up efforts to use gas in place of coal to clean up polluted urban skies. The country’s LNG deliveries may achieve 22 percent compounded annual growth from 2017 to 2020, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lu Wang.
Prompt LNG cargoes would also help offset disruptions of supply from other sources, such as pipelines. After shipments from Central Asia slipped during peak winter demand last year, LNG imports from Qatar jumped to the highest since 2014. China suffered a similar, though short-lived, Turkmenistan pipeline outage earlier this month.
Shorter Path
Novatek’s agreement with Saibu shows it’s prioritizing the Asia Pacific region as it optimizes its LNG portfolio, Rystad Energy analyst Xi Nan said in an email. It takes about 15 days to ship LNG from the company’s Yamal project in the Arctic to Asian markets via the Northern Sea route compared to about 30 days by a southern path that travels through the Suez Canal, she said.
Novatek, which is Russia’s largest producer of LNG, declined to comment.
The company plans to make the final investment decision on its Arctic LNG 2 venture, which could cost up to $25.5 billion, this year. It has an agreement to sell up to 15 percent of the project to  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), and Saudi Aramco has expressed interest in buying up to 30 percent in the plant, projected to have a capacity of about 20 million metric tons a year.
Novatek said in August it planned to complete a feasibility study by Oct. 1 for a 20 million ton per year trans-shipment terminal on the Kamchatka Peninsula that would allow special ice-class tankers carrying LNG from Arctic LNG 2 to transfer the fuel to more conventional vessels.
“The long-term success of Arctic LNG projects depends on routine, commercial navigation of the Northern Sea Route to reach key Asian markets,” said James Taverner, a London-based analyst at the industry consultant IHS Markit Ltd. “A key strategy for Arctic LNG projects is access to reloading and storage facilities close to end-user markets. This allows supply to be quickly and flexibly delivered to Asian buyers.”

The government set up a 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) fund this week to shore up Carige after the European Central Bank put it under temporary administration following the bank's failure to raise capital from investors.
Rome has several options for state support, including state-backed precautionary recapitalization.
The leader of the ruling 5-Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, has said Carige would be nationalized if the state put money in, comments echoed by members of the League Party which is also part of the ruling coalition, although Economy Minister Giovanni Tria has said he prefers a market solution.
""I am not aware that a nationalization is a doable path under current rules,"" Alberto Bagnai, the head of the senate finance committee, told Milano Finanza on Saturday when asked whether it would be better to put Carige in state hands.
Bagnai, an economist and a eurosceptic senator from the right-wing League party, said rules can be ""interpreted for friends"" but the ruling 5-Star and League coalition ""does not yet have many friends in Europe"".
Bagnai could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Claudio Borghi, another League politician who heads the lower house's budget committee, said one option was to combine Carige with Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), a bank that was bailed out by the state in 2016.
Carige's troubles stem from decades of mismanagement and too much exposure to the depressed local economy.
The ECB has pushed Carige to seek a merger with a stronger rival. Finding a buyer is now one of the tasks of the three commissioners appointed to run Italy's tenth-largest bank.
One of the commissioners said this week nationalization was not currently an option. 
Two sources told Reuters on Thursday that Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) might consider buying Carige if such a deal came with state financial support.

Banco BPM, which is Italy's third largest bank, has been mentioned in the press in recent days as a potential buyer of troubled Carige, which was put under temporary administration by the European Central Bank this month after it failed to raise capital from investors.
The ECB has pushed Carige to seek a merger with a stronger rival and finding a buyer is now one of the tasks of the three commissioners appointed to run Italy's tenth-largest bank.
In the past a three-way merger involving Banco BPM, which was created in 2017 from the merger of Popolare di Milano and  Banco Popolare , UBI and Monte dei Paschi has been mooted as a possible solution to help Tuscany-based Monte dei Paschi which was bailed out by the state in 2016.

1112,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Government Shutdown Hits Record Length With No End Seen,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government shutdown over President Donald Trump’s demand for border wall funding became the longest in the modern era as it stretched into its 22nd day Saturday with no end in sight.
Negotiations are at a standstill and no more talks are scheduled for the weekend or early next week. The White House scuttled efforts to reach a deal on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and Trump’s budget team is drawing up contingency plans for a shutdown that extends through the end of February, according to an administration official.
About 800,000 federal workers missed their pay for the first time Friday --at least some receiving pay stubs for $0.00 -- as unions sued the government for requiring their members to work without pay. At least one airport planned to close a concourse as absences rose among security screeners who haven’t received their wages. Trump said Friday that he planned to sign a bill guaranteeing that federal employees will be given back pay once the government reopens.
At Loggerheads
Democrats and the president remain at loggerheads, with party leaders saying they won’t agree to fund any kind of wall or barrier and Trump insisting he won’t agree to reopen the government until the wall is funded.
Some Trump allies have been encouraging him to declare a national emergency and redirect other funds to begin building the wall. But Trump said Friday that he wasn’t rushing to use that option, which would be challenged in court and, if not overturned, establish a precedent expanding the power of future Democratic presidents.
“I’m not going to do it so fast because this is something Congress should do,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with law enforcement officials who favor the wall. On Saturday, with Congress adjourned for the weekend, Trump in the first of three tweets on the shutdown that “Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown.” Lawmakers adjourned for the weekend but will return to Washington on Monday.
The shutdown on Saturday exceeded the 1995-1996 funding lapse, when Democrat Bill Clinton was president and Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House. That ended when congressional Republicans agreed to a short-term funding bill for closed agencies that was later extended.
The last meeting between Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leaders ended with Trump walking out. After Pelosi said she wouldn’t provide funding for a border wall even if rump reopened the government, the president said “bye bye,” in his words, and left the room -- a signature negotiating tactic for the former real estate developer and reality TV show star.
Since that meeting both sides have blamed each other. The White House has contended that Democrats are refusing to negotiate, while Democrats accuse Trump of forcing government workers to go unpaid as leverage to get $5.7 billion for a wall that voters don’t want.
An attempt Thursday by moderate Republican senators to broker a deal that would have traded immigration protections for undocumented “Dreamers” brought to the U.S. as children in return for wall money collapsed after Vice President Mike Pence rejected it.
One close Trump ally, Republican Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said Friday that he believed Trump was getting closer to declaring an emergency. “I think we’re talking days, not weeks,” the chairman and founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said. “I think he’s got to do it.”
‘Emergency NOW’
After meeting with Trump on Friday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it was clear to him and the president that ""Democrats don’t want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.” The only option, Graham tweeted, was for Trump to ""declare a national emergency NOW.”
House Democrats as well as a smattering of Republicans voted this week in favor of bills to reopen portions of the government.

1115,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>","In the Riskiest Corners of the Stock Market, Exuberance Is Back","(Bloomberg) -- Investors are throwing down the gauntlet to anyone who pronounced the last rites for stock bulls in the grip of the December meltdown.
Spurred by reassuring signals on trade, monetary policy and growth, the S&P 500 jumped 2.5 percent last week, after staging its biggest 10-day rally in a decade.
As money managers recite the buy-the-dip mantra once more, and traders cover their shorts, the safer equities tracked by quants -- offering low volatility or outsize dividends -- are losing their mojo.
Instead, U.S. companies riddled with leverage have posted their best two-week run in nearly three years while value shares rebounded at the fastest pace since 2016, according to portfolios compiled by Bloomberg.
A mere bounce from an overwrought sell-off, or proof there’s life yet in the famed bull market? On that, battle-weary market players are taking the skeptical side of the wager.
“If you look at what investors are starting to do, they’re starting to believe that we may be in some type of recovery mode,” said Khuram Chaudhry, a quantitative strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). “But I think it’s mean reversion from oversold positions -- I’m not of the view that this will persist in February and March.”
The Federal Reserve’s more dovish tone, resilient U.S. data and ebbing trade tensions appear to be breathing life into investing strategies hit in the December chaos. Last year, as volatility jumped, widening credit spreads punished levered companies while cheaper shares sensitive to economic swings took a battering.
Now, cyclical stocks are besting defensives at the fastest pace in almost a year, as the volatility futures curve and implied price swings signal easing fears of another market blow-up.
As earnings season and U.S. policy gridlock loom large, bulls need plenty of nerves of steel.
“Sentiment got extremely overdone to the downside,” said David Holohan, a strategist at Mediolanum Asset Management Ltd in Dublin. “People caught off-side by the move in December probably put on some shorts as protection and are having to unwind those positions.”
In a risk-on signal for computer and human traders alike, small caps -- dubbed a lead indicator for sustainable rebounds -- are also outperforming their larger peers. The Russell 2000 gained 4.8 percent last week, its best run versus the Russell 1000 since 2017.
The small-cap index is three points from 1,450 -- a level trend-following quants known as commodity trading advisers will accelerate their short-covering, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. As momentum builds, it could be a matter of time before hedge funds -- naysayers to the rally thus far -- boost their exposures en masse, according to the Japanese lender.
“U.S. equity markets are at a critical tipping point,” quant strategist Masanari Takada wrote in a Jan. 10 note.
Gear up for another headfake, warns JPMorgan’s Chaudhry. Until fundamental macro data bottoms, “it seems very premature to be putting too much money in very high-beta areas of the market,” he said.
With cash-rich investors re-balancing portfolios at the start of the year, there’s good reason to fret the rebound is on thin ice, according to Cyrille Collet, Paris-based head of quantitative investing at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi SA unit with 46 billion euros ($53 billion).
His funds remain in a bearish regime favoring equities with low volatility, strong balance sheets and high dividend yields.
“A lot of investors are buying stocks that have strongly underperformed last year,” he said. “It’s too early to say that the market is now totally bullish.”"
1116,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 02:56AM ET</span>",Nissan top executive Munoz resigns amid broadened Ghosn probe,"By Naomi Tajitsu
(Reuters) - One of Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) top executives has resigned, further rattling the Japanese automaker's management team as it broadens an investigation into ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct. 
Jose Munoz, widely considered as a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor to lead the automaking partnership between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), had been a ""person of interest"" in Nissan's widening internal investigation.
The 53-year-old, who was Nissan's chief performance officer and head of its China operations, made the announcement in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post on Friday. In a statement, Nissan said that Munoz had ""elected to resign"" from the company, effective immediately. It declined to offer details. 
He becomes the latest executive casualty since Nissan in November removed Ghosn as chairman and fired representative director Greg Kelly.
The resignation deals another blow to the Japanese automaker which is grappling with the scandal at a time when it is struggling to shore up profitability in the United States and expand aggressively in China.
Reuters had reported earlier on Friday that the Japanese automaker was looking into decisions made in the United States by Munoz who led Nissan's North American operations from 2016 to 2018.
""Unfortunately, Nissan is currently involved in matters that have and will continue to divert its focus,"" Munoz said in his post.
""As I have repeatedly and recently made clear to the company, I look forward to continuing to assist Nissan in its investigations.""
People with knowledge of the issue have said that Munoz, who had been placed on a leave of absence earlier in the month, had not been co-operating with the internal investigation.
Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan's alliance with Renault, remains in custody in a Tokyo detention center since his initial arrest in late November.
Ghosn has been indicted on two counts of under-reporting his income, and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan. 
The scandal has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and has escalated tensions between Nissan and Renault, where Ghosn remains CEO and chairman. 
Munoz joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe and led its significant expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States and posted record sales. 
Earlier this year, Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years. 

Since then, the world's largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.

""Last year, net foreign stock market inflows reached 300 billion yuan ($44.38 billion) and this year we estimate that inflows will increase further. We could expect 600 billion yuan,"" Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), was quoted as saying at a market forum.
It did not say where the forum was taking place.
Fang said that in addition to the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes, the inflows would be driven by a boost in the proportion of A-shares included in MSCI global indexes, as well as the inclusion of A-shares in FTSE Russell and Dow Jones indexes.
Fang also said that a number of U.S., Japanese and European investment banks had applied to raise their stakes in domestic brokerages to 51 percent. 
In December, UBS Group (S:UBSG) became the first foreign bank to win approval for a majority stake in a domestic securities joint venture.
Fang said that several foreign banks had expressed a hope to apply to raise their stakes to 100 percent once permitted by regulations, and that the CSRC would strongly support such a move.

China's benchmark share indexes were among the world's worst performing equity markets last year, losing around a quarter of their value as the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war put further pressure on the slowing Chinese economy. But stocks have drawn some support over the last month on signs of an easing in trade tensions.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>","Pemex's New York roadshow spooks investors, yields spike","By Sheky Espejo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Yields on the debt of Mexican state-run oil company Pemex rose sharply this week after the company failed during presentations in New York to lay out a clear plan to reduce debt and increase output, analysts said.
Pemex faces the possibility of a credit ratings downgrade due to costly proposals by the new government of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that include plans to build a new refinery and upgrade existing ones.
Half a dozen investors and analysts who either attended or were briefed on presentations in New York by the company's new chief financial officer, Alberto Velazquez, said they were unconvinced by the plan to turn around Pemex.
Mexican financial assets slumped late last year after Lopez Obrador canceled a partly-built airport project. They have regained ground in recent weeks, in part due to relief about an austere budget announced by his economic team.
Markets are watching closely for signs of how the new president will manage Latin America's second largest economy.
""It was a poor presentation and it is at a time when the market is increasingly sensitive about anything to do with Mexico,"" Pablo Cisilino, a portfolio manager at Stone Harbor, told capital markets publication Refinitiv IFR.
Pemex did not immediately respond for a request for comment.
The yield on Pemex's 6.5 percent coupon dollar bond due January 2029 spiked on Thursday and Friday, closing 35 basis points higher on Friday compared to Wednesday's close, according to Refinitiv data.
Both Pemex and the government were expected to try soon to issue debt on international markets, and the two-day road show launched on Wednesday by Velazquez and officials from Mexico's finance ministry was a bid to ease worries. 
""It backfired,"" said one New York analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], as the firm is formally known, has seen crude output drop for more than a decade as its major fields age and it has struggled to replenish reserves.
Another New York-based economist who attended the presentation agreed it did not go well for Pemex and said that the situation was ""worrisome.""

""They didn't know how to answer clearly,"" said the economist, who asked not to be named. ""We'll see how they do.""

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:48PM ET</span>",Slashed profit expectations may set stage for gains,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There could well be a silver lining in all the caution around the stock market as the earnings season approaches: Shares do way better when profit expectations have fallen, and lately, they've been falling like a rock.
By at least one measure, this is the most negative analysts have been ahead of a reporting period in nearly four years. Fourth-quarter reports get rolling next week with results from JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and other big banks.
Recent warnings on the quarter from high-profile companies have had investors bracing for more bad news. Earlier this month, Apple's (O:AAPL) big cut in its revenue forecast added to fears among some market watchers that a possible 2019 earnings recession - defined as at least two straight quarters of profit declines - may be on the horizon. 
With the bar low for companies to beat expectations, stocks could extend recent gains following the S&P 500's (SPX) worst December performance since the Great Depression.
""One of the key things the December selloff did was it priced a materially reduced set of earnings expectations for 2019. As a result, investors are going to be somewhat forgiving of companies who either miss estimates or are somewhat tentative in their guidance because they are now expecting that,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of investment and portfolio strategies at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management in New York.
""Any companies that talk about 2019 being just as good as 2018 or even sequentially a lot better are going to constitute an upside surprise,"" she said.
Case in point: General Motors. GM's (N:GM) shares soared more than 9 percent on Friday after the company said its earnings would top its earlier forecast.
Coming into that surprise announcement, Wall Street's estimates for GM's fourth-quarter profit had fallen by 12 percent since late October and the stock had dropped more than 20 percent over the last year.
While still relatively strong at 14.5 percent, analysts' estimated profit growth for S&P 500 (SPX) companies in the fourth quarter has fallen sharply since the start of October, when they forecast growth of 20.1 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For 2019, analysts are expecting profit growth of just 6.4 percent, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent and a big drop from 2018's tax cut-fueled gain of more than 20 percent. 
(GRAPHIC: Falling S&P 500 profit growth forecasts - https://tmsnrt.rs/2H80Idq) 
According to strategists at Bespoke Investment Group, the bar for this earnings season is ""extremely low.""
Heading into the fourth quarter, Bespoke analysts' earnings revisions for S&P 1500 companies are skewing more negatively ahead of any reporting period since the first quarter of 2015, they wrote in a report on Thursday. 
The S&P 500 rallied 2.62 percent in that six-week reporting period, and there have been just four prior earnings seasons since 2009 - when the U.S. bull market began - in which the earnings revisions spread for the S&P 1500 was more negative than it is now, they said. 
In each of those periods, the S&P 500 rose for an average gain of 4.33 percent.
""Analyst sentiment doesn't get much more negative than it is now, so if we start to see companies react positively to results early on, it would set the stage for a positive earnings season,"" the Bespoke strategists wrote.
To be sure, the S&P 500 uncharacteristically declined 5.2 percent in the last earnings period despite negative earnings revisions, according to Bespoke's data. 
That ""proved to be a major exception"" to the trend, they wrote.
Market valuations also have come down substantially. With the S&P 500 now trading near 14.9 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a multiple of 18 a year ago, market bulls argue that stocks have become undervalued after the recent sharp declines.
Investors also will be listening closely to what executives say about demand in China.
Apple cited slowing iPhone sales in China when it cut its sales forecast for the quarter that ended in December.
Comments about China and its trade conflict with the United States are likely to come up in conference calls and could affect investor sentiment, regardless of the earnings numbers.
""The commentary we're going to get on China and trade is going to be potentially pretty bad. It's almost like companies reserving for things that could go wrong in future quarters,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Some strategists said what could make it a successful earnings season from the market's standpoint might simply be any signs that 2019 earnings estimates are stabilizing.

""Just showing that these numbers are not falling off a cliff"" will be positive, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""That's what the market was pricing in.""

1121,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Major Reversal Indicator is Flashing ""BUY""","Along with his weekly report, Marvin Appel reveals a potential major market reversal based on a proprietary bottom fishing indicator utilizing MACD to detect oversold market conditions.
State of the market: Our major term reversal indicator gave a buy signal on Jan. 4, its first since 2011 (explained in detail below). This MACD-based indicator shows that the market is beginning to recover from very oversold conditions. It has an excellent record of spotting market bottoms. The buy signal makes it likely that 2019 will be profitable for stocks, although nearer-term prospects remain uncertain. Our main U.S. equity timing model, which unfortunately experienced a record drawdown during the fourth quarter of 2018, remains on a sell signal. It could move to “hold” as early as Jan. 14.
The S&P 500 SPDR (SPY (NYSE:SPY)) hit a low of 234 on Dec. 24 and has since rallied more than 9%. Potential resistance lies in the 257-263 area (see chart below). Using the 2011 correction as a guide, we could see a several-percent retracement at some point during the first quarter even if stocks are destined to enjoy a good year— as they did following the Oct. 3, 2011 correction low. 
I remain cautious about stocks. Unlike corrections of similar magnitude that occurred in 2011, 1998 or 1990, we are not in the midst of an economic boom like the 1990s, and the Federal Reserve will not pull a rabbit out of its hat with quantitative easing the way it did in 2011. The question is whether we are headed for a recession. Last month the bond market was telling us yes. Corporate bond prices were falling, spreads to Treasuries were rising and the yield curve was flattening. 
As an example, the chart below shows the yield spread from lower-investment-grade corporate bonds (Baa) and Treasuries. The wider the spread the greater payment the market demands for taking credit risk. Now at 2.4%, this spread is at its highest in two years. High yield bond spreads show a similar pattern, and are likewise at two-year highs even after the recent sharp recovery in high yield bond prices.
However, all of these potential warning signs have reversed themselves in recent days. If there is no imminent recession then high yield and floating rate funds, now yielding more than at any time since mid-2016, could be attractive alternatives to equity exposure, especially on a risk-adjusted basis. On the other hand, if there is to be a recession then neither equities nor riskier corporate bonds are attractive. We will have to follow the markets’ lead on this question. Either way, I believe that the time for exuberance about equities has passed.
Major Reversal Indicator is Flashing “BUY”
Back in 2002 I developed an indicator designed to identify major market bottoms based on analyzing the S&P 500 Index price data going back to 1941. As you will see below, this indicator has been quite successful over many years. On Jan. 4, 2019 this indicator flashed an entry for the first time since September 2011. More aggressive investors can use this as a bottom-fishing opportunity.
History of the Major Term Reversal Indicator
The indicator uses MACD to detect oversold market conditions that potentially represent important market bottoms. It generates entries only after significant market corrections or bear markets in the S&P 500 Index (not including dividends). There have been only 23 entries since the start of 1942.
The chart below shows all the entry signals since 1942 (blue vertical lines). Most occurred very close to major market bottoms. Note, however, that during severe bear markets such as 1973-1974, 2000-2003 and 2007-2009 there were entries that turned out to be very premature. 
The table below lists the 22 trades that have occurred and reports how the market behaved 13, 26 and 52 weeks after each entry. There is no formal sell signal with this indicator.
Implication
Of course, past results do not guarantee any future behavior. With that caveat in mind, history seems to suggest that entry signals have been very successful except during early stages of what, in hindsight, turned out to be severe bear markets. That suggests that how you interpret the Jan. 4 entry depends on whether you think we are at the start of a major bear market analogous to 2007-2009, 2000-2003 or 1973-1974.
Although government and corporate debt levels are extremely high, I do not believe that we are on the precipice of a major bear market. On the other hand, I do not expect the sort of market rally we saw after the September 2011 entry because back then, the Fed bailed out stocks with new rounds of quantitative easing. There will be no such intervention this time around. The entry signal is good news for equities in 2019, but does not rule out continued market volatility or a retest of the Dec. 26 lows. In particular, the first three months following entries have been no more profitable than average. As a result, investors should remain cautious but optimistic. "

We’ve already written extensively about the high stakes for Tuesday’s vote on Theresa May’s Brexit bill, but with eurodollar currency British pound cross (EUR/GBP) clocking in as the weakest currency pair on the day, we also wanted to highlight key levels to watch on the second most-traded pound cross.
As the chart below shows, the EUR/GBP hasn’t been able to form a meaningful trend of late, with rates mostly consolidating in the broad 0.8650-0.9100 range for over 15 months now. Given the three rejections off the 0.9100 handle in the last five months, we would expect that level to provide strong resistance on rallies in the coming week and beyond. In other words, traders will likely increase their selling pressure if and when EUR/GBP nears 0.9100, so it will likely take a strong EUR-bullish or GBP-bearish (no deal Brexit?) catalyst to push the pair above that barrier.
Source: TradingView, FOREX.com
Meanwhile, the unit is now testing its lowest price in over a month in the 0.8930 area, a zone that also served as previous resistance. If that near-term support level gives way, EUR/GBP could see a continuation down toward the late November low around 0.8810, with little in the way of previous support below there until the range bottom at 0.8650.
While it will be difficult to handicap developments out of Parliament, Downing Street, and Brussels in the days and weeks to come, EUR/GBP traders should keep a close eye on these four levels when planning their entries and exits."

Disney suffered a rare rebuke from its shareholders last year when a 52 percent majority opposed the compensation of Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote.
The proxy filing released on Friday showed that Iger's $65.6 million compensation for 2018 included $35.4 million in stock awards.

NEW YORK/OTTAWA (Reuters) - One of Huawei Canada's top executives on Friday disclosed he was leaving his post after more than seven years with the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, which is facing heightened scrutiny over security issues from Canada and its allies.
Scott Bradley disclosed his departure as the company's senior vice president for corporate affairs in a post on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) that did not give a reason for the move. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
Huawei Technologies Co is under intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. 
On Friday, sources told Reuters that Poland arrested a Huawei employee and former Polish security official on spying allegations, a move that could fuel Western concerns about the security of the company's technology.
Bradley was a key public spokesman for Huawei Canada, which has been under the spotlight since Canadian authorities in December arrested the chief financial officer of its parent company at the request of the United States.
Huawei is a major supplier of telecommunications equipment in Canada, where Bradley had served as chair of the 5G Canada Council, a national trade group promoting adoption of next-generation high-speed wireless technology. 
The Canadian government last year launched a new security review of Huawei's 5G technology, which at least two major Canadian carriers have said they plan to test in small-scale pilots. 
Bradley will serve as special adviser to the company, assisting the company ""as required,"" Huawei Canada President Eric Li said in a memo to staff that was obtained by Reuters.
""We are saddened to see him leave but grateful for the tireless work he has put in to help us grow our brand and public image, and build various relationships with government,"" Li said.
Bradley confirmed on LinkedIn that he intended to advise the company.

""As we start 2019, it is time for a change,"" Bradley said in the post. ""I continue to believe passionately in all of the values our Canadian team represents, and I believe that our team is one of the most innovative in the world.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - With securities regulators largely sidelined during the partial U.S. government shutdown, corporate executives may have to decide on their own what shareholder resolutions should go to a vote this spring. 
Many corporate boards will meet starting next month to choose which proposals to list on their proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings. If the shutdown drags on, they would have to go without guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC has stopped working through its queue of ""no-action"" requests during the shutdown, which is now in its 21st day. Companies looking to exclude certain proposals can request ""no-action"" letters from the SEC stating agency staff would not recommend enforcement action if the company skips the vote.
David Martin, an attorney for law firm Covington & Burling, said corporate clients are already calling with questions and the pace will ramp up as deadlines loom to mail out proxies.
""A lot of the public companies are beginning to wonder about this and worry about this,"" Martin said.
James McRitchie, a private investor in California who often files shareholder proposals, said the delay could help him press companies for change.
""My hand is strengthened if the company can't get an answer from SEC,"" he said.
The closure of about a quarter of the U.S. government is now tied for the longest ever. Many of the 800,000 employees who have been furloughed or who are working without pay missed their first paychecks on Friday.
Shareholder votes on issues like executive pay, climate change and diversity have gained more attention in recent years. Such proposals have drawn more support from big fund firms looking to attract deposits from retail investors.
Corporate lobbyists have argued many of these proposals are distractions that should not appear as ballot items. 
Covington & Burling estimates up to 300 no-action letters are requested by public companies each year, with agency staff granting about two-thirds of the requests.
The last no-action decision issued by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance came on Dec. 18, according to an SEC web page, and dozens of other requests are pending. 
An SEC spokesman cited the agency's operations plan for a shutdown which says staff will be unable to process tasks like issuing no-action letters.

Netflix's shift toward a ""vertically integrated streaming business,"" is accelerating, as the company reduces the level of licensing obligations to third parties and ramps up spending on original content, both of which should translate into a ""deeper moat, greater operating leverage, and meaningful free cash flow,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note to clients.
On the economic front, investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will adopt a slower pace of rate hikes this year were boosted as U.S. consumer prices dropped for the first time in nine-months.
""With little indication here that the acceleration in wage pressures or tariffs are causing any pickup in inflation, the Fed can take a pause in Q1 on raising rates to assess the health of growth indicators,"" CIBC said in a note to clients.
In other corporate news, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) slumped 9% after selling the rights to its Destiny franchise to developer Bungie – a move that could cost the company hundreds of millions in revenue, analysts warned.
KeyBanc slashed its 12-month price target on Activision's stock to $64 from $80, citing a short-term impact on the company's revenue and earnings following the termination of its relationship with Bungie.
The stumble in the broader market comes ahead of the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season, which gets underway in earnest next week with results from major Wall Street banks.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) are slated to report earnings on Tuesday, before US markets open.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>","GM bucks gloomy earnings forecast trend, shares jump","By Nick Carey and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) executives on Friday bucked gloomy forecasts for growth and sent the automaker's shares soaring, promising investors stronger 2019 earnings and outlining ambitious plans for its Cadillac brand to challenge Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) in the growing electric vehicle market.
GM said that despite forecasts of decline in U.S. and China passenger car sales, the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations, and promised higher earnings per share in 2019. Chief Executive Mary Barra, in her presentation to investors on Friday, stood her ground on cost-cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from U.S. President Donald Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials in the affected states.
""Because of the actions we have been taking for several years, General Motors enters 2019 leaner, more agile and positioned to win,"" Barra told investors at the New York presentation. 
The market cheered GM's forecast, sending the company's stock up nearly 8 percent.
""We're very much looking forward to the execution of what they've announced,"" said Tim Piechowski, portfolio manager with ACR Alpine Capital Research, which owns GM shares. Piechowski said GM's core business, its stake in ride services company Lyft and its Cruise self-driving car unit are together worth more than the company's recent share price indicates. 
Barra also said proposals from Ohio officials that GM sell its Lordstown, Ohio, small car factory to Tesla are ""moot"" because Tesla is ""not interested in our GM workforce represented by the UAW,"" the United Auto Workers union.
As Barra spoke with investors in New York, hundreds of GM workers demonstrated in Windsor, Ontario, across the Detroit River from GM headquarters, protesting the company's plan to shut its Oshawa, Ontario, vehicle assembly plant. The UAW is suing GM in connection with U.S. plant shutdown plans, and on Friday called on GM to build its new electric vehicles in the United States.
GM's bullish outlook coincided with new cost-slashing actions by rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which on Thursday outlined plans to cut thousands of jobs in its European operations and kill an experiment in providing van rides. Ford executives are scheduled to meet with investors next week on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.
Barra and her lieutenants have spent the last two years pushing a strategy to exit unprofitable markets in Europe and developing markets, restructuring money-losing operations in South Korea, and killing unprofitable car lines in North America. In November it put five North American factories, including four in the United States, on notice for closure, and cut almost 15,000 jobs.
""We are no longer investing in things that don’t make money,"" GM President Mark Reuss told investors on Friday. ""The future is coming fast. We are doing everything we need to do as fast as we can.""
ELECTRIFYING CADILLACS
That includes making the Cadillac brand ""the tip of the corporate spear"" on electrification, Reuss said. He outlined plans to launch a new generation of electric vehicles that would be ""profitable ... and attainable."" 
The automaker said Cadillac will become GM's lead electric vehicle brand as the largest U.S. automaker gears up to introduce a new model under that luxury brand to challenge Tesla, a development first reported by Reuters on Thursday.
Tesla's market capitalization is higher than GM's, even though the electric carmaker has never posted a full-year profit.
GM is relying on profit from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. The battle in that lucrative market is intensifying among the Detroit Three automakers as sales of small cars in the United States shrivel. Both GM and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) have launched revamped pickup trucks in a bid to take more share in the U.S. auto industry's most profitable segment.
Still, GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara emphasized to investors on Friday that the large pickup market is a three-company oligopoly protected by ""competitive moats."" Those include a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks that predates the Trump administration's trade actions.
GM's biggest market by vehicle sales volume is China, and the economic slowdown in the world's largest auto market has rattled investors across industries. Apple Inc (O:AAPL), for instance, last week took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, blaming slowing iPhone sales in China.
GM's China president, Matt Tsien, told investors on Friday that industry-wide auto sales in that country should stay roughly flat in 2019 after the 2018 decline. GM is taking actions to cut costs, including increasing automation in its Chinese plants and pushing down purchasing costs, he said. Cost-cutting coupled with 20 new or redesigned vehicles that will launch in China this year will sustain the company's profit, he said.
""Overall, GM is in a good position to mitigate the headwinds"" in China, Tsien said.
Kyle Martin, research analyst with Westwood management in Dallas, Texas, which owns GM shares, said GM's macroeconomic assumptions are ""not conservative, for sure. For China to be flat, you're going to need some stimulus.""
GM, with its Chinese partners, sells more vehicles in China than in the United States. The automaker builds locally most of the vehicles it sells in China.
BULLISH EARNINGS OUTLOOK
GM said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7.00, above the $5.86 expected by analysts according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Bottom line, we believe management just reset the bar higher for earnings and cash flow despite increased macro concerns among investors,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.
The company said it expects adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2019 to come in between $4.5 billion and $6 billion. 
Still, CEO Barra faces pressure to lift GM's share price, which has lagged broader market performance. The company has confronted challenges from activist shareholders twice during the past four years. 
GM shares rose as much as 9.3 percent on Friday and were still up 7.8 percent at $37.45 in afternoon trading.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Bovespa has rocketed to a 6.6 percent gain so far this year, making it the world's second-best performing stock market, but exchange data shows a persistent exodus of foreign capital in the early days of a new market-friendly administration.
Many foreign investors remain reluctant to raise their exposure to Latin America's largest economy after getting burned by volatility in the past, as with a lengthy market bust starting in 2011 that followed a commodities-fueled bubble. They are looking for more than cheery rhetoric from newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro, many market watchers said.
Daniel Gewehr, head of Latin America Equity Strategy for Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil in Sao Paulo, citing his close contact with foreign stock investors, said many are waiting for concrete signs of progress, particularly on a pension reform that may struggle to win support in Congress.
""They don't expect necessarily the approval of the pension reform in short-term, but a positive momentum that would come with actions such as a privatization plan or implementing a proposal for central bank independence,"" he said.
The far-right leader and his economic advisors, dubbed the ""Chicago boys"" for their ties with Nobel laureate Milton Friedman's alma mater, have promised to cut the country's large budget deficit, privatize a raft of state-owned companies and open the economy to more competition. 
Those pledges have been music to the ears of investors in general, but particularly local funds, who have been key actors behind the recent rally.
Most remain eager for signs of how Bolsonaro and his Economy Minister Paulo Guedes will tackle the country's public debt, now at around 77 percent of GDP.
An improvement on that front could bring down long-term interest rate futures, something that would boost investment in stocks.
'PRUDENT'
The Benchmark Ibovespa index (BVSP) touched an all-time peak of 93,987 points on Thursday.
B3 exchange data shows, however, a net outflow of 1.1 billion reais from foreign investors' transactions by Jan. 9, extending a net outflow of 11.5 billion reais in 2018.
Jorge Mariscal, chief investment officer of emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management in New York, said the Brazilian stock market was one of the best performing last year and a lot of optimism had been priced in, so ""reducing some exposure is a prudent thing to do.""
""There are some political hurdles to approving a pension reform but positive momentum is building. If the reform is approved I would expect fund flows to turn positive again,"" he said.
Others insisted the time to buy is now. 
Pablo Riveroll, head of Latin American equities and portfolio manager at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) in London, believes Brazil is one of the most attractive emerging markets.
""It has a domestic cyclical recovery which is relatively independent of global growth, and we think valuations are still attractive in spite of decent market performance,"" he said. 
""We are overweight Brazil and have added to Brazil in recent months,"" he added.
Of the 66 stocks traded on the B3 exchange, only nine were in negative territory for the year as of Friday's close.
Chris Dhanraj, head of U.S. iShares Investment Strategy at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) in New York, said Brazil's accelerating growth and excess capacity are a powerful combination for earnings growth. But he agrees with a general view that investors are waiting for more solid steps by the government towards reforms.
The first weeks of the new government may have helped fuel that caution. Divisions have emerged quickly among Bolsonaro's ministers, with infighting and policy flip-flops.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Commodities trader Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] has refused a judge's order to hand over the email archives of two former executives in Brazil who are facing corruption charges over accusations they bribed officials at state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro.
Brazilian federal prosecutors on Friday demanded in a court filing that the Switzerland-based firm preserve the emails. They may contain evidence that other top executives at Trafigura were aware of millions of dollars in bribes paid to Petrobras (SA:PETR4) executives for sweetheart oil contracts, the prosecutors say.
Trafigura declined to comment, pointing to a prior statement about the case in which it said it takes the accusations seriously. 
The case is part of Brazil's ""Car Wash"" probe that has revealed stunning political graft at Petrobras, brought down presidents and politicians, and sent scores of businessmen to jail.
Now, prosecutors are aiming for their biggest targets yet - multinational firms who have done business with Petrobras in the past two decades. Brazilian prosecutors allege corruption took place on U.S. soil and money was laundered through American and European banks, which could greatly widen the probe. 
Aside from Trafigura, other powerhouse commodity traders like Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL],  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) and Mercuria Energy Group are also under investigation.
Vitol has said it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities. A Glencore spokesman said the firm takes ethics and compliance seriously, and that it is cooperating with the investigation. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. 
Petrobras has suspended oil and fuel trading with Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura.
Trafigura's Brazilian attorneys filed documents before the federal court saying the firm was likely prohibited by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from handing over the emails of former executives Mariano Marcondes Ferraz and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes. Both men have been charged for bribing Petrobras officials, which they have denied.
According to a court document, Trafigura Limited sent a Dec. 31 letter sent to its Brazilian subsidiary Trafigura do Brasil, in which it wrote that it had been advised by outside counsel that it would have to carry out an extensive examination of its responsibilities under the GDPR in several jurisdictions and also examine what individual country laws state about data privacy. 
Trafigura questioned the Brazilian judge's demand that the emails be handed over, writing that ""it remains unclear whether the request in respect of Mariano Marcondes Ferraz is indeed within the scope of the decision made by the judicial authority.""
It argued in its court filing that it could potentially face a fine of 4 percent of its global revenues - well over $5 billion - if it is found in breach of the EU data laws.
Brazilian federal prosecutors declined to comment beyond the Friday court filing demanding the email archives not be destroyed.
Prosecutors have accused the European multinationals and some smaller players of collectively paying at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Petrobras, to sell them oil at favorable prices.
They have repeatedly said the firms' top brass had ""total and unequivocal"" knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be going on.
More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by competition and greed. 
Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen to cover their tracks, allowing them to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries. 

Earlier this week, the Brazilian court overseeing the investigations against the commodity traders disclosed that one such alleged middleman had been arrested in Miami on the request of the Brazilian judge.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 03:24PM ET</span>",Battered U.S. bank stocks may get a boost this year,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - After a miserable 2018, big U.S. bank stocks could be in for a lift if upcoming earnings releases show strong fourth-quarter loan growth helps to offset weak trading revenue.
And some bargain hunters are also betting on stronger 2019 growth than current valuations imply.
The S&P 500 bank index <.SPXBK> fell 18.4 percent in 2018 compared with a 6.2 percent drop for the broader S&P 500 (SPX) as investors fled banks on concerns about slowing economic growth, weakening credit, a flattening yield curve and bets the Federal Reserve would slow down interest rate hikes.
While some investors are still wary of the sector, which was at the epicenter of the last economic downturn, others say the sell-off went too far. Lisa Welch, lead portfolio manager for the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund in Boston, was encouraged by a pickup in loan growth data in the fourth quarter and also expects banks to report improving net interest margins.
""With the valuations they're trading at, we see banks as an extremely attractive buying opportunity,"" said Welch. ""Bank stocks were acting like the economy in the U.S. was going into a near term recession. We disagreed.""
S&P 500 banks currently trade around 9 times forward estimates, well below the long-term median of 11.6 and the long-term average of 12.7, according to data from Refinitiv. 
""Even with a little more cautious view on the economy, that's going to slow from the growth we had in 2018, we still think there's a lot of earnings growth potential,"" said Welch.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 Bank Valuation vs median and average - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SO1VI5) 
On Friday the S&P bank sector was up 0.2 percent compared with a 0.2 percent decline for the benchmark index. (N) 
The fourth-quarter corporate reporting season will kick off with results from  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) on Monday, Jan. 14, followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) the next day.
Wall Street expects 25.5 percent fourth-quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 banks and 27.4 percent for 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv which show bank earnings growing at 10.7 percent in 2019.
According to Jefferies analysis of Federal Reserve data, U.S. bank loans grew 4.7 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared with 3.2 percent a year ago, while commercial and industrial loans grew 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 2.6 percent in the year-ago quarter.
""We'll have to see if that's sustainable but at least that's a better story for the fourth quarter,"" said Kush Goel, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman in New York. ""People have become too pessimistic on the group. Loan growth and commentary will be better than people fear.""
Many bank investors have worried that bank credit costs will rise as the current economic expansion ages and as economic growth slows.
The sector has also been crushed by uncertainty about how much further the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and how its hiking path will affect net interest margins and loan growth. While higher rates tend to boost bank margins, they could also stunt loan demand as borrowing gets more expensive.
Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equity for  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance in Boston, estimated a less than 50 percent chance of a ""Goldilocks situation"" where Fed policy is just right for banks. 
While Dunn said bank stocks could rise in 2019, some valuations do not look cheap when rising credit costs are taken into account.
""You've seen the peak in great credit and it's probably likely to get worse from here. I'm not saying its going to fall apart, just incrementally,"" said Dunn who favors Citigroup shares over JPMorgan due to their valuations.
""I wouldn't say we're pounding the table buyers here in financials and banks. We're picking up a couple of good opportunities here and there,"" he said.

State-owned Monte dei Paschi said earlier on Friday the ECB had flagged in a letter the difficulties facing the bank due to its restructuring commitments and the ""significant challenges"" in raising funds on the market.
The letter contains the ECB's draft conclusions after an annual supervisory review which will be finalised in the first quarter.
Under the terms of its restructuring Monte dei Paschi had committed to sell the junior bond in 2018 but, like other Italian banks, it has been hit by a market freeze triggered by investor concerns at the anti-austerity policies of a new government.
The bond is needed to replenish Monte dei Paschi's second-tier capital but the bank has failed to tap bond markets since the anti-European coalition took power before the summer.
""The bank could start sounding out the market next week,"" the source said.
Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had warned it about its weakened capital position and its profitability, which is below the restructuring plan's targets.
The bank said the ECB had also flagged the risks stemming from Monte dei Paschi's large exposure to Italian government bonds, whose value has fallen sharply after May.
The ECB had set its provisional capital requirement for 2019 at 11 percent, the bank said.

The ECB has also recommended the bank continues to set aside money to cover loan losses in the coming years, Monte dei Paschi said.

Underpinned by optimism over China-U.S. trade talks and expectations of a slow pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, the stock market's recent winning streak added 6 percent to the S&P 500 (SPX) and left it up about 10 percent from the 20-month low it hit around Christmas.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which reports on Tuesday, dipped 0.41 percent.
U.S. stocks took a severe beating in the last quarter of 2018 due to worries over trade, rate hikes and a slowdown in global growth. 
Analysts expect S&P 500 companies' earnings per share to grow by 6.4 percent this year, compared with 23.5 percent in 2018, when they were supercharged by newly enacted corporate tax cuts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 02:57PM ET</span>",Citigroup allows hedge fund ValueAct more access,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will give ValueAct Capital more access to its books and board of directors, signaling that the bank and the activist hedge fund are deepening their relationship roughly a year after ValueAct first invested in Citi.
The two said on Friday that they had entered into an ""information sharing and engagement agreement,"" which will allow for a ""deeper level of engagement and cooperation."" 
The San Francisco-based hedge fund, one of the industry's most closely watched activist investors, unveiled a $1.2 billion stake in New York-based Citi last May, and said it liked the bank's low risk and reliable revenue.
ValueAct has increased its position in recent months and currently owns about 32 million Citigroup shares, or 1.3 percent of the outstanding, according to company filings.
The fund is one of the larger shareholders of Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets.
ValueAct, which differentiates itself from many more voluble activists, did not ask for a board seat at the time of its investment and said on Friday that it is not looking for one now. The agreement, which essentially offers the hedge fund rights that come with having a board seat, is a first for ValueAct, a firm known for working collaboratively and behind the scenes with target companies.
But when the time is right and some potential conflicts are eliminated, ValueAct is expected to propose a candidate for the board, the statement said. ValueAct currently holds a board seat at  Alliance Data Systems  Corp (N:ADS), which competes with Citigroup in issuing credit cards for retailers.
ValueAct generally holds core investments like Citigroup for three to five years, a person familiar with the fund said.
ValueAct and Citigroup on Friday declined to comment beyond the release.
By entering this agreement, the hedge fund is signaling its plans to likely become more involved with this bank than with  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), another name in its portfolio. ValueAct has invested roughly 35 percent of its portfolio in financial service companies.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke called the agreement positive for Citi, saying the company faces ""a stretch"" to reach its return on tangible common equity target of 13 percent by 2020. 
Citigroup has made a number of changes since ValueAct first commented on its stake in May in a letter to its investors. It parted ways with the head of its struggling branded-credit cards division, announced a reorganization of part of its investment bank, and named a new chairman and a new chief financial officer to replace those retiring.
Its shares have lagged those of other big banks because of doubts about its ability to increase revenue following extensive restructuring after the financial crisis.

Citigroup, which will report fourth-quarter results on Monday, was trading at $57.06 on Friday, up roughly 1 percent and outperforming the sector.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",German finance ministry often met Deutsche Bank on strategy in 2018,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's finance ministry regularly met with top  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) executives in 2018 for talks that included topics such as strategic options (DE:DBKGn), a finance ministry letter seen by Reuters on Friday showed.
The letter, written by a deputy finance minister to a member of Germany's parliament in response to questions and dated Jan. 10., listed 23 meetings between the finance ministry and Deutsche Bank executives in the period May to December 2018.
Subjects discussed in the meetings included ""strategic options of the institutes and evaluations by the leadership of the finance ministry"", the letter said.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung first reported on the letter and the meetings between finance ministry officials and Deutsche Bank executives. 
There has been longstanding and widespread speculation that Berlin may try to engineer a merger of Germany's two biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has helped feed that speculation by stressing the need for a strong German banking sector, a shift in tone from his predecessor.
The letter also responded to a request to evaluate a possible merger between Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which is 15 percent owned by the government, and other lenders. 
""The government is open to economically viable options,"" the letter said, noting that operational and strategic questions were a matter for executives.
Joerg Kukies, a deputy, represented the ministry at many of the meetings, while Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing represented the bank at six meetings.
The bank's chairman Paul Achleitner sat in on another six meetings, the meeting list revealed. 
A spokesman for the Finance Ministry had no immediate comment. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. 

Executives for both banks have played down the idea of a merger, saying that they need to focus on restructuring and improving profitability before any possible tie-ups.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","We'll help with Russia sanctions fall-out, German minister tells business","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will try to protect German and European companies from some potentially ""massive collateral damage"" if Washington levies further sanctions against Russia, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Friday.
Maas, speaking on Friday at a new year reception of the German Committee on East European Economic Relations, an industry group, said he expected the newly elected U.S. congress to move swiftly to bring new sanctions against Moscow.
""Our aim is to reach agreement (with the U.S. on sanctions) and protect German and European companies from the in some cases massive collateral damage,"" he said. 
He did not give further details but his remarks are likely to cheer German exporters hard hit by European Union and U.S. sanctions imposed after Moscow invaded and annexed parts of Ukraine in 2014. 
Washington has led the way in demanding tougher measures against Moscow, while Germany, which has deep trade ties with Russia and depends on it for much of its imported gas, has been far more cautious.
""For us sanctions ... only make sense when, as with the EU's sanctions, they are tied to clear, fulfillable conditions,"" said Maas, in an apparent softening of his more hawkish tone on Russia when he took office last year. ""Sadly, that is no longer the case for U.S. sanctions.""
Earlier, the industry group's chairman Wolfgang Buechele had criticized the U.S. sanctions for being too vague and unclear for German exporters to adhere to, pleading for German government backing if they were further tightened.
The EU last month extended for a further six months sanctions targeting Russia's financial, energy and defense sectors. They were originally imposed in July 2014 after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.
The U.S. expanded its sanctions in December, adding 15 members of Russian military intelligence and four entities involved in alleged election interference to a blacklist that allows for their assets to be frozen.
The new Democrat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, incensed by allegations of collaboration between President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russian lobbyists, is preparing congressional hearings on Trump's alleged Russia ties.
A particular focus of both their and Trump's ire is the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, by supplying Germany with Russian gas directly under the Baltic Sea, will cut Ukraine out of lucrative transit fees even as it fends off a Russian-backed insurrection in its east.
But Maas said he had told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that sanctions targeting Nord Stream 2 would not be appropriate.

""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin agreed last year to continue gas transit through Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nord Stream 2 isn't Germany and Russia going it alone. I say to critics of the project: questions of European energy policy must be decided in Europe, not the U.S.""

As we learned from FOMC Powell yesterday, the FOMC can be patient on one hand and nervous on the other with inflation data central to their pause in tightening along with financial conditions. 
The rally in equities this week balances against the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning. The role of oil bouncing with equities and the role of better U.S.-China trade talks supports renewed global growth views and adds to the one-handed risks for today. Against this we have the U.S. government shutdown, the weakness in retail sales and autos in China and Europe and the ongoing uncertainty from emerging markets.
One has to respect the calendar in the week ahead, and remember it won’t be until Friday that we get the full picture – with China growth data and U.S.-Q4 earnings— for why a one-handed market seems particularly scary. All that puts the stories from overnight into perspective with weaker Japan household spending, lower EcoWatchers survey, smaller current account surplus, weaker Italian industrial production, weaker UK industrial production all pointing to trouble in Q4 that sets the momentum for Q1 and beyond. The risk barometer to watch isn’t the Chinese yuan (CNY) – its expensive here – nor is it the euro (EUR/USD) at 1.15 as the ECB looks as confused as the FOMC. Rather, the safe-haven story to respect should it start to move today or next week is the Japanese yen (JPY/USD) with 107.50 the pivot to watch for a return to flash crash 105 barriers. "
1161,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",Bitcoin ETFs - Cash-backed Vs. Physical- How Will They Impact the Market,"The crypto space is fixated about the potential for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) to launch, with many speculators, experts, and enthusiasts saying that a Bitcoin ETF could spark the next major Bitcoin rally.
But whether a Bitcoin exchange traded fund is backed with cash or actual Bitcoins, i.e. “physical,” makes all the difference between an ETF being a good or bad thing for the Bitcoin market. Here, we’ll explore the difference between cash-backed and physical Bitcoin ETFs.
Physical Bitcoin ETFs
The Bitcoin ETF that garnered the most attention in 2018 was the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin ETF, and this is perhaps because it is backed by actual Bitcoins rather than cash.
Despite 1,400 favorable comments from the public, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly delayed its decision on the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin ETF, and it seems possible that this ETF will eventually be rejected. In-fact, numerous Bitcoin ETF applications have been sent to the SEC, and all of them have been rejected.
If a physical Bitcoin ETF like VanEck SolidX were approved, it would likely be a good thing for the Bitcoin market. Since a physical Bitcoin ETF is backed by actual Bitcoins, when people invest in a physical Bitcoin ETF, it would increase Bitcoin’s spot demand and spot price.
This effect could be quite significant since a physical Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC would be available on major stock trading platforms and make it easy for stock, bond, and precious metals investors to diversify a percentage of their portfolios into Bitcoin.
Considering that there are tens of trillions of dollars in the global financial markets, even a minute percentage of portfolios being diversified into Bitcoin via a physical Bitcoin ETF could cause a major Bitcoin rally.
Cash-backed Bitcoin ETFs
The evil cousin of a physical Bitcoin ETF is a cash-backed Bitcoin ETF such as the Direxion, Proshares and Graniteshares ETFs that were rejected by the SEC in August. At the time, these ETFs were rejected several crypto news outlets painted this as negative news when it was in-fact positive news.
A cash-backed Bitcoin ETF could be catastrophic for the Bitcoin market, especially if it is approved before any physical Bitcoin ETF is approved. This is because cash-backed Bitcoin ETFs essentially print paper Bitcoins, and that artificially inflates the Bitcoin supply, which can apply downward pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. This is similar to how the Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are cash-settled and are therefore paper Bitcoins. CME Bitcoin futures have been catastrophic for the market.
A more direct impact of a cash-backed Bitcoin ETF is that it would divert investment away from the spot markets. There could be tremendous capital invested into a cash-backed Bitcoin ETF, and it would do nothing to increase Bitcoin’s price. It would actually cause Bitcoin’s price to be lower long term since investors would buy the cash-backed Bitcoin ETF instead of actual Bitcoins.
So a Bitcoin ETF is a double edged sword. A physical Bitcoin ETF could be quite beneficial for the market while a cash-backed Bitcoin ETF could be poison. Crypto investors, traders, speculators, and enthusiasts must be aware of this when commenting on these to the SEC or interpreting news about them.

The dollar consolidated higher Thursday. What did Fed Chair Powell actually say? We look to data from Japan & Australia Thursday night and a big read on U.S. CPI Friday. What are the trading levels to know? How are we trading it?
E-mini S&P (March)
Thursday’s close: Settled at 2594, up 11.50.
Fundamentals: U.S. benchmarks are holding firm near the top-end of their recent range with the S&P (SPX) facing the psychological hurdle at 2600 and what’s just above it. Thursday, Fed Chair Powell continued to paint a patient and flexible rhetoric on hiking interest rates next. However, he pointed to momentum in growth carrying from last year. He is not wrong, growth only dipped in December. Three’s a trend, the next 30 to 60 days will be picked apart.
Doubling down, he said he sees the Fed’s balance sheet substantially smaller. Equity markets initially did not like that comment but were able to battle back before close. The Fed’s path of tightening faces a key test today with U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) coming out. We watch the core read most closely and this has not signaled that inflation is running away. In fact, on a year-over-year basis, it has come in shy of expectations for three of the last four months and has only beaten it twice in the last year. The month-over-month level (0.3%) has not seen extreme growth since last January.
xpectations for today’s results come in at 2.2% year-over-year and 0.2% for the month.
Headline risks persist with everything from U.S.-China trade to Brexit and the government shutdown facing its fourth week. The S&P 500 has gained for four straight sessions, but has not altered the technical picture. We maintain our viewpoint that this run is tiring and is within 1% of its exhaustion point in the near-term.
Technicals: The S&P settled within our key resistance pocket of 2592-2596.75 Thursday after trading to a high of 2599.50; the psychological 2600 barrier remains elusive, but more importantly we have major three-star resistance overhead at 2603-2609.50. Depending on your conviction level, you do not want to tip-toe around and wait for a direct test to resistance without having any short exposure on or not getting out of longs.
Crude Oil (February)
Thursday’s close: Settled at $52.59, up 23¢.
Fundamentals: WTI traded to an overnight high of $53.31 as it attempts to post gains for the ninth straight session. Our narrative has not changed; we need a fresh catalyst to hold $50. Such can easily come one of three ways: Most importantly, Domestic stockpiles must shrink. Crude has battled in the face of bloating storage of its own and within the products.
Furthermore, Cushing has added for 15 out of the last 16 weeks. Additional jawboning from OPEC or Saudi Arabia could feed the recovery’s appetite. Saudi Arabia announced this week they would slash exports, and this should trickle into U.S. inventory data and they doubled down saying fresh action from OPEC might be necessary. Lastly, a flat-out trade deal between the U.S. and China would bring a massive tailwind to risk-sentiment. Baker Hughes rig count data is due at 1 pm EDT.
Gold (February)
Thursday’s close: Settled at $1,287.40, down $4.60.
Fundamentals: Gold traded to a high of $1,295.70 and CPI data Friday was right in-line with expectations. This should leave the technicals in control with another lower high for the metal on the chart.
We have pounded the table that we prefer to capitalize on strength and even such there has been multiple swings this week to buy first key support and sell against strong resistance. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is unchanged and today’s close will also bring technical importance. While the dollar is unchanged, it does not include the Chinese yuan (CNY) which has gained 1.5% on the week against the dollar and is trading at its strongest level since July 26. This has provided a tailwind for gold to start the year and furthermore, China added to its gold reserves in December for the first time since October 2016.
Lastly, traders should keep a pulse on risk-sentiment, it’s ok if the Dollar Index holds ground, if equity markets show weakness or Treasuries recover from a recent move lower; this would bring support to gold.

1163,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",BREXIT- Pound in Focus as Meaningful Vote Looms,"Great Britain and Prime Minister Theresa May are running out of time if their Brexit plan is rejected next Monday, which will likely cause extreme weakness in the British pound, according to Fawad Razaqzada.
Next week’s major market risk event is most likely to be the UK parliament’s so-called “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the European Union at the back end of last year.
The deal covers the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU and the framework of future relations with the bloc. It was originally scheduled to take place in December, but May decided to delay the vote after it became obvious that members of Parliament would vote against it. The embattled Prime Minister has since made little progress, if any, to win support. Brexit proponents argue that this deal is not what people actually voted for in 2016, as it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules.
“Remainers” are obviously against any Brexit deal, but some from this camp also argue that under this deal, the UK will be worse off than staying within the EU. Therefore, it is likely that members of Parliament would still vote against May’s deal on Tuesday, which could lead to more uncertainty and confusion, not to mention volatility in the markets. The impact of the vote is obviously going to be felt on UK assets first and foremost, but such is the importance of the vote that it could impact the global markets as well. If, for example, it triggers a sell-off in the stock markets then we could see safe haven assets such as gold and Japanese yen gain further support.
As far as today is concerned, well the pound has risen on the back of a report from the Evening Standard, which suggested that a Brexit delay beyond March 29 looks increasingly likely, citing Cabinet ministers on the matter. The pound’s positive reaction suggests investors are betting that the potential delay in the official exit date means the chance for a no-deal outcome would decrease.
But as it stands, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, with or without a deal. However, things could change dramatically next week, depending on the outcome of the vote. It is possible, for example, that May might resign if the parliament rejects her deal, which could pave the way for a whole host of possibilities and uncertainties. But May is likely to fight her corner even if defeated. So, instead of immediately resigning, she may come up with plan B, but the Prime Minister will then only have three parliamentary days to do so. That would take us to Monday Jan. 21 for a potential second parliamentary vote. If her plan B is also then defeated, she may either resign or call for a general election. Other options include leaving the EU without a deal, which is the worst-case outcome for the pound, while calling another EU referendum is an alternative scenario. Unless May’s Brexit proposal passes the vote, any other options would probably involve delaying the official exit date of March 29, provided the EU agrees to it.
As we approach Tuesday’s eagerly-awaited vote, the pound is likely to turn even more headline-driven and volatile as some speculators try to pre-empt the outcome of the vote, as we have seen today with spike higher in the British pound (GBP/USD). Meanwhile those who have existing positions on sterling may decide to take profit, further exacerbating GBP’s stability. The potential for increased volatility is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for scalpers and short-term term trading strategies, but speculators who like to take longer-term directional views on the pound may be better off waiting for the outcome of the vote before deciding on a trade. On the other end of scale, aggressive traders may wish to buy as close to support or sell as close to resistance if they want to be in the market in the lead up to the vote, although we don’t recommend this strategy as it can be very risky.
Among the pound crosses, the GBP/JPY is among the most volatile pairs in normal times, but will be more frothy should the outcome of Tuesday’s vote trigger a risk-off response in the markets. So, the GBP/JPY has the potential to drop sharply if May’s Brexit deal is rejected by the parliament.
However, if the vote somehow passes then this pair could absolutely surge, as May’s Brexit vision is seen as being a market-friendly deal. In other words, her deal, if approved, would represent a “soft” exit from the EU, which could limit the damage the UK economy might face in the short to medium term, compared to say, a no-deal Brexit. This would encourage the Bank of England to hike interest rates to combat inflation, thus sending yield-seeking investors into the pound.
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com
The GBP/JPY has staged an impressive rally off its 2019 low at 131.95, which it hit on Jan. 2 (see chart above). Ahead of the Brexit vote, it has now reached the pivotal technical area between 139.35 and 140.00. This range was the last support prior to the latest breakdown. Once support, this level could turn into resistance going forward. But if the bulls reclaim this resistance zone then rates could push higher in the short-term, with the next potential resistance coming in at 141.60. Meanwhile, the next support levels come in at 137.65 and 136.80 respectively. If the latter breaks, say, on the back of the Brexit vote on Tuesday, then we wouldn’t rule out a potential drop towards the next psychological level around 130.00. In any case, traders need to be extra vigilant to the prospects of price spikes, flash crashes, and indeed flash melt ups, and take appropriate measures to minimize these risks. Good traders are, above all, good risk managers."
1164,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",Crude Reversal- You Ain't seen Nothing Yet,"OPEC production cuts will soon start to bite and make us forget about a so called over supplied product market, notes Phil Flynn, Senior Energy Analyst, The PRICE Futures Group.
Remember that talk of an oversupply in oil? Well that was so last year— or maybe December. The recovery in oil is now at the longest winning streak since 2010 — at least in terms of consecutive up days, not by overall price move. The shift in mood is based on the fact that the end of the year swoon in oil was due to a lot of false prices and irrational pessimism.
That pessimism put into motion the underpinning for this consequential comeback and signals much higher prices later this year. While we are coming into significant resistance at $53.50 and again at $54.17, based on February WTI, the reality of OPEC production cuts will start to set in. In the short term a battered shale sector will be hard pressed to match the cuts until later in the year when new pipelines start to open to remove oil bottlenecks. Yet in the short term, we expect U.S. rig counts will continue to decline and U.S. production will stagnate.
OPEC production cuts will soon start to bite and make us forget about a so called over supplied product market. While we seem to have a lot of gasoline, we still must have the right type of gasoline. We will still have to go into summer blends and drawdown supply.
While more shale oil may be good for gasoline diesel, it is still a challenge. Nick Cunningham at Oil Price writes: “One consequence of U.S. shale continuing to grow while OPEC+ countries keep barrels off of the market, is the increasing shift towards lighter oils in the global crude slate. Oil from West Texas tends to be light, while barrels from Saudi Arabia are more of the medium variety. Prices for gasoline and naphtha have grown increasingly weak – a result of the surging supply of light oil. Meanwhile, medium and heavy supplies are less abundant, and diesel prices reflect that.
Nick says that the “light/heavy disparity could grow as the year wears on, with the impending regulations on marine fuels from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set to take effect at the start of 2020. The IMO rules will force dirty fuel oil out of the mix for ship-owners, and diesel and other distillates will be called upon to fill the void. Analysts have long predicted that the IMO rules could drive up global crude oil prices.
Norway oil output is also falling. Reuters reported that Norway’s oil regulator reduced its forecast for production this year, predicting crude output could drop to the lowest in three decades before recovering in 2020. Oil output of 82.2 million cubic meters, or 1.42 million barrels a day, would be the lowest since 1988. The forecast compares to actual production of 86.2 million last year and is down from an earlier estimate of 87.2 million."
1165,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:19PM ET</span>",Money woes? More companies help workers build emergency funds,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - At the Springdale Ice Cream and Beverage factory in Cincinnati, workers were coming to the human resources department with money troubles, wanting cash advances on their pay. 
Some could not afford car repairs, which meant they could not get to work. Others needed money for medical bills, home repairs and other emergencies. 
Human resources manager Erica Simmons wanted to help. She enrolled the company, a division of Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, in a pilot program called Split to Save. The Consumer Federation of America started the Split to Save initiative about a year ago, and other employers on board include banks, credit unions and the City of Boston. The goal is to help workers build their own emergency savings accounts through regular payroll deductions. 
""It’s important that our associates are doing well and that means their physical and mental health and their financial health,"" said Simmons, who signed up for the program herself and has been saving a portion of her paycheck every month automatically. 
Employers routinely help workers save for retirement every pay period, but automatic withdrawals to fund emergency savings accounts have not caught on in most workplaces. 
The plumbing is all there, experts said, but there is a lack of will and coordination to promote the option. With 800,000 federal workers caught up in the government shutdown, the need for emergency savings has been in the spotlight. 
One problem Springdale ran into at orientations for new employees was that the new workers were enthusiastic, but many lacked savings accounts. So Simmons got the local credit union to give a presentation and sign up customers for accounts. 
About 80 new hires have been offered financial training in the last six months, and the company will soon expand to the rest of the plant's 220 or so existing employees, Simmons said. 
Workers take a pledge and the payroll administrator sets up the transfer. The company does not control the funds once they are deposited or even know how much anyone is saving. 
""Our challenge is to increase the number of people who use existing systems,"" said Consumer Federation's George Barany, who noted that 84 percent of workers currently use direct deposit. 
A similar program just launched from  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Retirement in coordination with the organization Prosperity Now. It has a handful of client participants, including MGM Studios, a division of MGM Holdings Inc . 
While Prudential is in the retirement business, one aim with the savings sidecar is to reduce the stress on 401(k) loans and cash-outs that damage retirement savings, said Phil Waldeck, president and CEO of Prudential Retirement. 
Because retirement funds are locked up to a certain extent, most Americans cannot pay to repair a simple tire blow-out. 
""Cars break down, people get sick. They tap places for money that are not optimal because they are in crisis,"" Waldeck said. ""For retirement plans to make the impact, you have to deal with long-term readiness but also short-term issues.""
AARP, the nonprofit catering to older Americans, is also starting to plan such a program. So far, the organization has sponsored a survey on the topic and is working with noted behavioral economists David Laibson, Brigitte Madrian and John Beshears to come up with methodology for starting accounts. 
AARP said its research has determined that automatic enrollment would be one of the most effective ways to build emergency savings accounts. However, legislative changes would be needed for that, and those are not likely to be coming soon. 
""We are very close and sometimes you can almost taste it, then things get delayed,"" said David John, a senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP Public Policy Institute. 
EARLY RESULTS
Workplaces that have started any type of savings program have found employees are enthusiastic. 
At WesBanco, a community bank in Wheeling, West Virginia, pledges to Split to Save since February 2018 from 161 employees total $235,758, and the average monthly commitment is $148.68 a month. 
The bank has 2,000 employees, and human resources head Lisa Werner has a goal of 800 employees at minimum. She planned to do a big push after the new year to get more people on board. 
""We get hit with so many temptations, but we don’t have an equal number of positive messages that say, hey, work for something bigger and better for your family,"" said Werner. ""We’re trying to encourage those additional messages.""

(In paragraph 11, please read A similar program just launched from Prudential Retirement...in coordination with the organization Prosperity Now...client participants, including MGM Studios, a division of MGM Holdings Inc"" instead of ""A similar program called Prosperity Now just launched from Prudential ... client participants, including MGM.""

(https:// 
Fox Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said in November it was still an ""open question"" whether the company will buy back the regional sports networks it sold to Disney (N:DIS) in July as part of the $71 billion deal.
Disney won a bidding war last year against cable company Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) to acquire Fox's assets. But the U.S. Justice Department has said Disney, which owns cable sports network ESPN, must divest Fox's 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets.

After the Disney sale is completed, Fox will carve out a new company, including Fox News, Business, Sports and the Broadcasting Company which it expects to have annual revenue of around $10 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares closed higher on Friday after hitting one-month highs as investor appetite for assets considered risky remained firm, despite caution over trade and ahead of earnings season.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) ended 0.1 percent higher on its fourth straight day in the black -- its longest winning streak since November.
But Frankfurt, Paris and London all ended in negative territory as enthusiasm over China's trade talks with the United States waned without hard evidence about what was agreed.
Worries about slowing economic growth in China also lingered while Wall Street's gains from a rally on Thursday faltered as Q4 results season kicks off in earnest next week.
""The lack of additional detail in relation to the update (on U.S.-China trade talks) has encouraged some dealers to trim their positions ahead of the weekend,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
China-sensitive autos and parts suppliers (SXAP) led the falls, down 1 percent.  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) dropped 6.4 percent, the biggest faller on the CAC 40, while Continental (DE:CONG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were among the biggest DAX decliners.
Still in the first full trading week of 2019, the STOXX 600 gained 1.7 percent as investors regained their appetite for risk boosted by dovish comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.
Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, the biggest in 11 weeks, BAML said. 
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) erased earlier gains as sterling bounced amid growing expectations that the government may delay its departure from the European Union beyond March 29. [FRX/]
Focus remained on Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get her Brexit deal through parliament, with a crucial vote due on Tuesday. A drastic about-turn in crude prices also weighed on heavyweight oil stocks (SXEP).
In the healthcare sector, downgrades by Jefferies hit UDG Healthcare (L:UDG) and Orion Oyj (HE:ORNBV) which were the worst individual performers with falls of 7.7 percent 7.4 percent respectively. 
French utilities took a hit after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) downgraded ratings on Suez (PA:SEVI) and Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), citing doubts about the global growth outlook. 
The stocks were down 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.
The UK's housebuilders were stand-out gainers on the day after BAML upgraded its view on the sector, saying ""it seems at least possible, or even probably, that some sort of Brexit resolution is within sight and therefore the UK housebuilding sector may see some relief"".

 Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and  Persimmon  (L:PSN) were leading British blue chips, both rising more than 4 percent.

1187,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",U.S. Companies to Gain Staunch Defender in Trump DOJ Pick,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Justice Department comes with a track record that signals he could take a softer stance in policing mergers and promote a more business-friendly approach to prosecutions.
William Barr, the nominee for attorney general, spent 14 years in senior leadership at  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). and a predecessor, GTE Corp., before serving as a director at companies including  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX). and hedge-fund firm Och-Ziff Capital Management Group.
That experience would make him the first attorney general in decades to bring an extensive corporate background to the nation’s top prosecutorial post and potentially sets up a sharp turn from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who devoted much of his two-year tenure to cracking down on illegal immigration and opposing the legalization of marijuana.
Barr would join a string of Trump cabinet heads who are rolling back regulations across the U.S. economy, from telecommunications to the environment. An establishment Republican who previously served as attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush, Barr begins a two-day Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. The Republican-controlled Senate is likely to confirm him, handing him wide-ranging influence over companies through his oversight of merger reviews, financial fraud and foreign bribery cases.
Abuse of Power
Barr has a history of assailing government regulation and corporate enforcement. At a 2004 conference held by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal policy group, he accused prosecutors of abusing their power and overreaching in corporate investigations. Government lawyers in white-collar cases, he argued, are ""very young, very inexperienced and don’t have the breadth of judgment that’s necessary.""
“Many enforcement agencies, they have a way of avoiding a result in court, which is just to grind the corporation into dust by continuing investigations ad nauseam,” Barr said. Many enforcement agencies couldn’t win if they took the case to court, he added, but use investigations “to kill the company with a death of a thousand cuts.”
Barr, 68, would return to the top job at a time when the department is juggling a number of high-profile investigations, including  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.’s $22 billion accounting charge in its power-equipment unit, allegations of foreign bribery by Airbus SE, and a years-long inquiry into corrupt payment allegations by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. Its biggest merger investigation is T-Mobile US Inc.’sc (NASDAQ:TMUS) proposed $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp (NYSE:S).
‘Hands-On Approach’
“He would be more likely to take a hands-on approach to corporate criminal cases and investigations than his predecessor,” said George Stamboulidis, a former federal prosecutor and now co-chair of the white-collar group at Baker & Hostetler LLP in New York. Given his experience in business and government, Barr will also likely have a larger say in changes to corporate enforcement policy, he said.
As Bush’s attorney general, Barr came under fire for not appointing an independent prosecutor in a sprawling bank-fraud scandal known as Iraqgate that involved the funneling of funds to that country. At the time, Barr also oversaw the department’s prosecutions stemming from the savings and loan crisis and a revitalization of antitrust enforcement following a pullback during the Reagan administration.
Telecom Deals
Barr had a front-row seat to major telecom deals after leaving the department. As general counsel at GTE, he worked on the company’s sale to Bell Atlantic and fought the merger of WorldCom and MCI, according to his Senate questionnaire. The GTE-Bell Atlantic deal formed Verizon, where Barr served as general counsel and worked on Verizon’s acquisitions of MCI and Alltel.
While at Verizon, Barr opposed net neutrality rules that prohibited broadband providers from slowing or blocking internet traffic, arguing they would deter investments by telephone and cable companies to improve internet service. Net neutrality regulations were implemented during the Obama administration and abandoned last year by regulators under Trump.
“It threatens the ability to recoup investment and deprives the network owner of the freedom to compete,” Barr said at a 2006 event hosted by the Federalist Society. “The proposed regulatory regime equals a less diverse internet. It means not more but fewer products, services and players.”
Consulting Stint
Barr’s corporate background, which includes a stint consulting for  BP  (LON:BP) Plc on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, will benefit the department’s work, said George Terwilliger, a lawyer at McGuireWoods LLP in Washington who served as deputy attorney general under Barr.
“Understanding how businesses and major corporations actually work internally is a helpful perspective when judging the conduct of those kinds of organizations,” he said.
Barr also served on Time Warner Inc.’s board of directors when the company was sold to AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). That position put him in conflict with the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, who unsuccessfully sued to stop the sale last year. The Time Warner case marked a radical shift in how the department polices mergers between companies that operate in different part of a supply chain, known as vertical deals.
The lawsuit was the first time in decades the government went to trial to stop such a deal. Trump opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger, vowing to stop it when he was a candidate.
Time Warner Clash
Before the lawsuit was filed, Barr and Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive officer at the time, met with Delrahim and two of his deputies to try to reach a settlement. Barr told them that the antitrust division’s model predicting higher pay-TV prices for consumers from the deal “was insubstantial, unrealistic and bore no relationship to how the media and telecommunications marketplaces actually function,” according to a court filing Barr made in the case.
Barr told Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, that he will recuse himself from the case, which is pending appeal. Still, his views could signal more openness to vertical deals in media and telecom industries going forward, according to Dan McInnis, an antitrust lawyer at Thompson Hine LLP in Washington.
“It makes it more likely that DOJ’s reaction to losing the AT&T case is to soften their position on vertical deals rather than double down,” he said.
Barr will have the ultimate say on whether the department allows T-Mobile to buy Sprint or files a lawsuit seeking to block the merger. The deal would further consolidate the U.S. wireless market by uniting the third- and fourth-biggest carriers. Consumer groups want the government to challenge the deal because they say it risks raising consumer prices by cutting the number of national competitors to three from four.
Antitrust Enforcement
Barr supported vigorous antitrust enforcement the last time he was attorney general, according to Jim Rill, who led the antitrust division under him. He supported an initiative to broaden the division’s reach overseas. Under the Reagan administration, the department took a position that it should only be concerned with anticompetitive conduct in foreign markets that had a direct effect of raising prices for U.S. consumers.
Barr ditched that position so that antitrust enforcers could target competitive restrictions overseas that harmed U.S. exporters.
“He was very supportive of what we were doing,” said Rill, now a lawyer at Baker Botts LLP in Washington. “He in no way was critical and no way tried to say, ‘Slow down.’”
Barr would take over a Justice Department that’s already made several changes under Sessions that make it easier for companies to avoid criminal charges or massive penalties.
Third-Party Payments
Sessions, a former senator from Alabama, barred the department from imposing penalties in corporate cases that required payments to third parties. Such payments were the crux of multi-billion-dollar settlements with Wall Street banks during the Obama administration over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds that fueled the 2008 financial crisis.
During his tenure, the department sought to prevent multiple agencies from issuing penalties for the same wrongdoing. It also made it easier for companies to avoid criminal charges by self-reporting potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain business.
Those are policies Barr is likely to continue.
“He’s not coming at this as being a street prosecutor of drug gangs,” said Michael Koenig, a former Justice Department prosecutor now a partner at Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP. “He will have a broader base understanding of corporate principles and corporate conduct.”

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:41AM ET</span>","Nissan expands Ghosn probe to more countries, executive Munoz under scrutiny: sources","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) has broadened its investigation into ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn to include dealings that took place in the United States, India and Latin America, three people with knowledge of the inquiry said.
In one aspect of their internal probe, company investigators are looking into decisions made in the United States by Jose Munoz who led Nissan's North American operations from 2014 to 2018, the people said. Munoz was recently placed on a leave of absence due to the probe, they added.
Nissan said this month that Munoz, its chief performance officer and widely seen within the industry as close to Ghosn, was on leave ""to allow him to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.""
Munoz is not cooperating with investigators, two of the people with knowledge of the probe said, both describing his actions as ""stonewalling"".
One of the sources described Munoz, who currently heads Nissan's China operations, as a ""person of interest"" in the probe, adding that it was not clear whether he would be accused of any wrongdoing.
Munoz, 53, did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The people with knowledge of the probe spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A lawyer for Ghosn, Motonari Otsuru, said in an emailed comment: ""I am unaware of this."" 
Some of the questions put to Munoz relate to dealer franchise rights, one of the sources said. Other questions relate to contracts with parts suppliers and service providers that Munoz approved when he was at the helm of Nissan's U.S. operations, another source said.
The sources said the findings made as part of the probe into Ghosn's affairs in the U.S. market are being shared with prosecutors. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment.
Nissan has said its internal investigation had uncovered ""substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct"" by Ghosn and that its scope is expanding. 
Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan's alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), has been charged with under-reporting his income. On Friday, he was also charged with aggravated breach of trust, accused of shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan. 
In his first public appearance since his Nov. 19 arrest, Ghosn declared his innocence in court on Tuesday, saying he had never received compensation that was not disclosed and that Nissan had not suffered any losses due to a temporary transfer of a personal foreign exchange contract. 
The transfer had been a temporary measure to prevent him from having to resign and use his retirement funds as collateral, Ghosn said.
Sources familiar with the matter have also said Nissan investigators are examining other dealer franchise decisions in several countries where Ghosn played a part in the decision-making to see if there had been any misconduct. 
In particular, the automaker's investigators are looking into Ghosn's role in what Nissan insiders have described to Reuters as a surprise decision in 2008 to pick a company called Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd (HAI) as Nissan's partner for marketing, sales, after-sales service and dealer development in India.
A different firm, TVS, had been lined up for the role after much research by Nissan management in India when Ghosn personally intervened at the last minute to push for HAI, four Nissan insiders said. They add that in 2012, HAI became the Nissan's exclusive national sales firm in India, despite being relatively inexperienced in distributing vehicles to dealers.
Reuters was unable to find a representative for HAI, which according to India's Registrar of Companies was dissolved as of Sept. 11, 2018. TVS did not respond to a request for comment.
The probe is also looking at what appear to be outsized payments for Ghosn's bodyguard services in Brazil, one of the sources said. 
Ghosn's lawyer Otsuru did not respond to requests for comment on the expansion of Nissan's probe into dealings in India and Brazil. A U.S. representative for Ghosn declined to comment.
One source also said Nissan is conducting audits of some distribution partners in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia's Al-Dahana which owns half of a joint venture called Nissan Gulf with the other half held by a wholly owned unit of Nissan Motor. 
Al-Dahana, a marketing and dealer development firm, is majority owned by Khaled Al-Juffali, vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia's largest conglomerates. Reuters has reported that Al-Juffali is the person prosecutors believe arranged a letter of credit for Ghosn over his foreign exchange contract after which a company that Al-Juffali owned received four payments totaling $14.7 million. 
Both Ghosn and the Khaled Juffali Company have asserted that the payments were for legitimate business purposes. Asked about the audit, a representative for the Khaled Juffali Company said the firm stood by its previous statement.
Another Nissan executive, Arun Bajaj, senior vice president for human resources and who heads talent development for Nissan's alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), has also been put on a leave of absence ""to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.""
Bajaj is being questioned and is cooperating with both Nissan's internal investigators as well as prosecutors, the sources said, adding that they expect him to return to work soon. It was not immediately clear what the questions were about. Bajaj did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Ghosn is unlikely to be granted bail and is expected to remain in detention throughout his trial as is often the case under Japan's criminal system, Otsuru told reporters this week. Ghosn's trial may not begin for another six months, he added.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>","Hitachi, UK say no decision taken on British nuclear project","By Susanna Twidale and Makiko Yamazaki
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Hitachi (T:6501) has yet to decide whether to proceed with its trillion yen ($28 billion) nuclear project in Britain and talks with the government are continuing, the company and government said on Friday.
Hitachi's Horizon Nuclear Power unit has struggled to find investors for its plans to build a plant in Anglesey, Wales, which could provide about 6 percent of Britain’s electricity.
Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported that Hitachi had decided to freeze the project, although it also reported that the board had yet to vote to make it a formal decision.
A spokeswoman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with Hitachi were continuing. ""The negotiations on that are ongoing and those are obviously commercially sensitive so I can't comment,"" she told reporters.
May met Japanese Prime minister Shinzo Abe this week in London. He told her Japan did not want to see a disorderly Brexit when Britain leaves the European Union in March. 
Hitachi said in Friday's statement that it had been assessing the project ""including its potential suspension and related financial impact."" 
""Should any matter arise which needs to be disclosed Hitachi will announce information in a timely manner,"" Hitachi said.
Nikkei reported that Hitachi had decided to freeze the project, leading to a special loss of 200 billion to 300 billion yen ($1.9 billion to $2.8 billion) for the year ending in March. Hitachi's board would vote on the suspension at a meeting next week, it reported, without citing its sources.
Hitachi said in its statement on Friday: ""These articles aren't based on Hitachi's decision or disclosed information.""
Hitachi was hoping a group of Japanese investors and the British government would each take a one-third stake in the equity portion of the project. A company source has said the project would be financed one-third by equity and rest by debt.
Britain wants new nuclear plants to help replace its aging fleet of nuclear and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s, but high up-front costs have deterred construction.
Another Japanese firm, Toshiba Corp (T:6502), scrapped its British NuGen project last year after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer.
Britain's Nuclear Industry Association said it is vital new nuclear projects went ahead to maintain electricity supplies.
""New nuclear is an integral part of a future decarbonized power supply,"" said the association's chief executive, Tom Greatrex, said.
Environmental group Greenpeace said Britain should rethink its energy strategy and place more focus on renewable energy.
Shares of Hitachi rose by as much as 6 percent on the Tokyo stock exchange after the report.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>","Volkswagen delivered 10.8 million vehicles in 2018, eyes world No.1 spot","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen Group's (DE:VOWG_p) deliveries rose 0.9 percent to a record 10.83 million last year, the German company said on Friday, putting it neck-and-neck with Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi in the race to be the world's biggest vehicle manufacturer.
Rivals Toyota Motor (T:7203) and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi have not released 2018 registration figures, but the Franco-Japanese alliance sold 10.6 million vehicles in 2017 and racked up sales of 5.54 million in the first half of 2018. 
Toyota last month released a forecast for total global sales of 10.55 million vehicles last year, but has yet to confirm official numbers. 
""If we assume that the 10.8 million sales VW have reported is confirmed, it is very likely to be enough to place Volkswagen Group in the number one spot,"" said David Oakley, an analyst at LMC Automotive. 
That would be the fifth consecutive year Volkswagen Group has held the position, Oakley said, adding it was too early to say whether Toyota or Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi would be in second place, also because registration figures have not yet been published for all markets.
Volkswagen Group's figures include sales of light vehicles and trucks. Measured by passenger cars alone, registrations last year would have accounted for 10.1 million, it said. 
""If we looked at passenger cars only, the picture would be roughly similar. Volkswagen Group would still be ahead, although by a wider margin, as it is relatively less reliant on light commercial vehicles than the other two,"" Oakley said.
Only around 4 percent of Volkswagen Group’s sales were light commercial vehicles in 2018 compared with 12 to 15 percent for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Toyota Group, according to LMC. 
If heavy goods vehicles were included in addition to light trucks and passenger cars, Volkswagen would still be ahead and Toyota would be in second place, Oakley said. 
Volkswagen said the VW brand delivered 6.24 million vehicles last year, while premium brands Audi (DE:NSUG) and Porsche posted registrations of 1.81 million and 256,000 respectively.
This makes Audi the third biggest selling premium brand behind BMW, which delivered 2,125,026 cars and leader Mercedes-Benz, which sold 2.31 million passenger cars.
Volkswagen said the ongoing trade dispute with the United States had dampened the business climate in China, its most important market, over the second half of 2018.
Volkswagen's head of sales, Christian Dahlheim, said in a webcast on Friday that he expected demand in China to remain stable in 2019, although the first quarter would be challenging. 
Separately, Dahlheim said the German carmaker did not foresee a significant financial impact in 2019 from the implementation of the new WLTP emissions standard, which cost the company 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2018.
Volkswagen Group said December deliveries fell 8.4 percent, to 916,200 vehicles, from 999,900 a year earlier. 
December group deliveries to China dropped by 12.5 percent year-on-year, the Wolsburg-based carmaker said, adding deliveries also fell by 5.6 percent in Europe and by 3.4 percent in the United States.

Citing unnamed sources close to the matter, Valor said CEO Roberto Castello Branco is trying to push out independent board members Segen Estefen and Durval Santos, whose terms end in 2020.
The board is expected to decide soon on a ""transfer-of-rights"" dispute with the government, which is worth billions of dollars and relates to a promising offshore oil area. With the departure of Estefen and Santos, the new government would name four of 11 board members at Petrobras, as the company is known, given the recent resignation of two other board members.
Such an abrupt turnover for theoretically independent board members underscores long-standing corporate governance questions for the hugely influential oil company, which past governments have often used as a blunt tool for economic policy.
Petrobras did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has railed against the state's outsized role in the Brazilian economy, even proposing that Petrobras and other state-run firms be privatized or split up.
Preferred shares of Petrobras slipped 1.2 percent in early trading, more than the 0.2 percent decline of the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP).
Earlier this week, Petrobras said in a filing that the country's audit court was analyzing a potential $14 billion payment from the government to the company to settle the transfer of rights issue. The Economy Ministry had denied reports that this would be the final number.

A government credit on that scale for Petrobras would add to headaches for Guedes and new President Jair Bolsonaro, who are struggling to rein in a gaping budget deficit.

1195,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Innovative Industrial Properties IIPR,"The past year saw the legal cannabis market explode. Canadian cannabis stocks were the hot investment of 2018. And they went on a ridiculous ride, observes growth stock expert Jason Williams (NYSE:WMB), editor of The Wealth Advisory.
Many went from their initial price offerings (IPOs) to $20 billion companies within a few weeks, and back down to the ground over the following months. So, it might seem odd that my “conservative” pick for 2019 is in the same industry. But it’ll all make sense when you hear what this company is doing and where.
Canadian cannabis is last year’s news. The U.S. is where the real money will be made in the future. Our industry is expected to reach $10 billion this year. And according to Marijuana Business Daily, it could get as high as $22 billion by 2022.
And it’s still illegal in the U.S. But over 30 states now allow medical marijuana use and seven states plus Washington, D.C., allow recreational use. And that will likely increase in 2019.
But there will be a lot of volatility out there. And there will be rallies fueled by speculation just like there were with the Canadian companies. So, you need an investment that’s immune to those kinds of wild swings but will still profit every time another state votes “yes.”
Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) is that kind of investment. It’s a real estate investment trust that owns marijuana cultivation and processing facilities and rents them to cannabis operations. The leases are triple net, which means that IIPR’s tenants pay all the bills, all the taxes, make the repairs, and pay rent to Innovative Industrial. That’s not a bad deal.
The stock is up by more than 100% since last year. It’s one of the best-performing cannabis stocks out there, now that the high-flying growers are coming back to earth. Plus, because it’s a REIT, it has to pay at least 90% of its pretax profits to investors. It’s like you’re getting paid every time someone gets high.

1196,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Texas Instruments TXN,"Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a leading producer of embedded and analog semiconductors and an excellent all-purpose stock for volatile markets; it is a fortress of solid fundamentals in a troubled high-tech sector, asserts Joe Duarte, growth stock expert and editor of In the Money Options.
And if 2019 is anything like the last quarter of 2018 long term investors are likely to be rewarded for their patience and their foresight when they own shares of this company. 
From a macro standpoint, the semiconductor space is forecast to slow over 2019 and perhaps 2020, in what is expected to be a cyclical correction after a multiyear expansion since 2015. 
It is also reasonable to assume that most technology stocks will be similarly affected by the general state of the sector given the interdependence of the sector especially the general dynamics of order flows and operational relationships.
So what sets this company apart from the crowd? Strong management, a wide book of system, its forward planning structure, obsessive attention to detail in its operations, factory operation, and a fountain of free cash flow (FCF), the money left over after expenses. 
Indeed, FCF is the central metric for this company which reported a 40% growth rate in FCF with a $5.9 billion cache over the trailing twelve-month period reported in Q3 2018. Specifically, FCF is a pool of cash for the company to distribute to its investors via dividends and stock buybacks.
The latter is especially important because the firm has an $18 billion buyback program in place, and recently increased its dividend by 24% ($3.08 per year — 3.26% yield), its 15th straight year of dividend growth.
Texas Instruments has a pristine balance sheet with $5.11 billion in cash on its balance sheet and $5.1 billion in debt, which is averaging a 2.77% coupon rate. The company continues to grow its revenues and is expected to remain earnings positive for the foreseeable future. 
Moreover, it’s concentrating its efforts in automotive and industrial semiconductors where the potential for robotics and artificial intelligence continues to expand and should continue to do for the extended term.
As a result, I believe the stock is the best positioned company in its branch of technology, with a strong book of business, sound management and a strong balance sheet. The bottom line is that when it’s all said and done, Texas Instruments should still be standing and poised to grow its business. Buy above $90.

1197,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Walmart WMT,"Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) — our top growth pick for 2019 — is the world’s largest retail and wholesale business; while it is best-known for being a low-cost provider of consumer goods, they have also made some critical shifts to capitalize on their position in the marketplace, by utilizing their robust distribution network in the grocery business, Joe Laszewski, senior portfolio manager for Stack Financial Management.
Walmart has been winning at grocery by leveraging their scale and logistical expertise to offer better stock levels and fresher perishables, along with new innovations like online ordering, in-store pickup, and in-home delivery. More importantly, the Company’s firm foundation in grocery helps to drive foot traffic into stores, where customers ultimately purchase higher-margin items.
The company's focus on grocery has helped them not only steal market share from traditional supermarket chains, but it also helps to insulate them from challenges facing many retailers that are losing revenue to online competition. 
The company recognizes how e-commerce has changed the marketplace and has also made several strategic acquisitions, the largest of which include Jet.com and Flipkart, to bolster its digital profile. Online sales growth is slated to come in around +40% in fiscal 2018, yet e-commerce is a significant opportunity to grow the top line, as it accounts for less than 5% of total revenue.
With stakes in China and India, Walmart is one of the few retailers positioned to participate in the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies. These initiatives are working, as evidenced by U.S. comp sales growth recently posting the strongest 6-month period in over a decade. 
From a valuation standpoint, Walmart trades at a trailing 12-month price/sales ratio of 0.5, which is in-line with long-term historical averages. However, the Walmart of tomorrow will not look like the Walmart of today. The earnings and margin strain in the near-term, caused by dedicated investment in digital and logistics, will be met with accelerated revenue growth to drive share price appreciation. 
In today’s market environment, Walmart offers the valuable stability and defensive characteristics that one would expect of a well-established Consumer Staple. However, the company has the scale, capital assets, and logistical expertise that virtually no one else has, giving them an opportunity to grow revenue in today’s highly competitive retail landscape.
With a continued focus on remaining a low-cost leader, while also improving the shopping experience, WMT carries wide appeal to both the baby boomer and millennial consumers. Although Walmart is unlikely to quickly dethrone Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the retailer is finding ways to leverage what they do best and take market share.

1198,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Sangamo Therapeutics SGMO,"Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) is the leader in gene editing, and an unappreciated leader in gene therapy as well; with many value drivers coming in 2019, the stock is our top speculative pick for the coming year, explains Jay Silverman, analyst with The Medical Technology Stock Letter.
The company has more in vivo gene editing studies underway than the entire gene editing universe combined, including the CRSPR companies.
A year ago in the first in vivo gene editing study in history, SGMO began treating adults with MPSII with SB-913. Management has always noted that once safety and efficacy was shown in the initial adult participants, it would discuss the results with the FDA and Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) in order to allow younger patients to be given the novel gene editing treatment.
On the Q3:18 quarterly call, the company announced that adolescents aged 12-17 would begin to be enrolled. Less than 3 weeks later, SGMO has posted an update saying that children as young as 5 year olds are now being enrolled.
This is a clear signal that the regulators are in agreement on the company’s program, as permanently editing the genes of a child has potential risks involved — and the agency believes that the initial responses warrant taking such risks.
Moreover, if gene editing occurs at an early age, many of the neurological and physical symptoms of MPSII could be stopped well before the condition advances.
The clean safety of SGMO’s ZFN technology stands alone in the revolutionary world of gene editing, especially compared with potential off-target toxicities of other technologies (e.g., CRSPR, etc.).
When SGMO announced initial positive results in August, the stock dropped sharply because while delivering significant drops in GAG, they could not measure IDS levels with the available assay used at the time.
Since, then the company has been working on developing a new test to measure IDS levels that appear to be gobbled up by organs (e.g., liver) as soon as they are produced. Measurable IDS enzyme levels appear to be the gating factor in gaining the Street’s appreciation of this revolutionary and positive study.
In 2019, SGMO will emerge as the leader in gene editing as positive clinical data will validate both the platform and management’s ability to execute. In addition to clinical catalysts, there is strong potential for more collaborations (e.g., CNS/Immunology).
The stock is a favorite of ours for 2019 as either on its own and/or compared with other gene editing stocks, in our view, Sangamo is undervalued. The stock is a buy under $30 with a target price of $40.

In fact, the company believes it has the most widely distributed financial services and banking franchise in the U.S., asserts Timothy Lutts, chief analyst and editor of Cabot Stock of the Week.
The company works behind the scenes in most cases, but that’s been enough to produce an enviable track record of growth in recent years.
It has both a product and a platform business. On the product side, Green Dot has a slew of offerings, though its core products are simple things like bank accounts, checking accounts, prepaid (and reloadable) debit cards and credit cards with a slew of perks.
The firm’s distribution network for its various products is amazingly large, with more than 100,000 brick and mortar locations selling its cards.
The platform business, which it refers to as banking-as-a-service, allows partners to develop their own banking and financial offerings for their customers. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay Cash runs on Green Dot’s platform, as do Walmart’s MoneyCard and Intuit’s Turbo card,
All told, Green Dot makes money from transaction fees, recurring monthly account fees, interchange fees and interest income. And all four areas have been growing steadily as the company expands its partnership and reach.
Revenue growth has averaged 22% over the past four quarters (revenues were $230 million in the 3rd quarter), while earnings growth has averaged 50%. Analysts are looking for 13% earnings growth next year, but that almost certainly is too conservative.
As for the stock, it’s been in an uptrend over the past three years, but as we approach the end of 2018, it’s 20% off its high, presenting you with a nice buying opportunity.

1201,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Anheuser-Busch InBev Soars on Possible IPO of Asian Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Anheuser Busch Inbev NV ADR shares jumped the most since 2015 after people with knowledge of the matter said the world’s largest brewer is considering an initial public offering of its Asian operations as a way to unlock value after a string of acquisitions left it saddled with debt.
The Leuven, Belgium-based maker of Budweiser has been talking with potential advisers about the possibility of listing its Asian business, according to the people. Any deal could raise more than $5 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.
The company’s shares (BR:ABI) rose as much as 7.2 percent, the most since September 2015, to 65.63 euros in Brussels trading on news of the potential listing.
AB InBev may seek to value its entire Asian business at around $70 billion through the share sale, though the eventual figure would depend on market demand and growth prospects for the business, the people said. Deliberations are at an early stage, and AB InBev could opt against pursuing a transaction, according to the people.
A value of $70 billion “looks very excessive to us,” James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a note.
The world’s largest brewer has been looking to reduce borrowings following its purchase of SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc for more than $100 billion in 2016. AB InBev shares fell 38 percent last year, making it one of the worst performers on the Euro Stoxx 50 index of European blue chips.
“We are always looking at opportunities to optimize our business and drive long-term growth, of course subject to our strict financial discipline,” a representative for AB InBev said in a statement, declining to comment on specific deals. “We are committed to our businesses in the Asia Pacific region and excited about the potential in this geography.”
AB InBev hasn’t chosen a listing venue, though Hong Kong is a possibility, the people said.
Missed Expectations
Investors have been questioning AB InBev’s strategy after its third-quarter results missed expectations and the company halved its dividend. Asia Pacific contributed $2.3 billion of AB InBev’s revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30, accounting for 17 percent of global sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Asia has been a key battleground for international brewers as consumption of mass-market lager slows in North America and Europe. The continent’s prospects dimmed slightly in the third quarter, with Heineken NV in October reporting its weakest Asian beer volume growth in three years.
AB InBev is the largest foreign beer maker in China, with a 16 percent share of the market in 2017, according to research firm Euromonitor. It has been focusing on selling higher-end brands in the country including Corona and beers made by Boxing Cat, a Shanghai-based craft brewer it acquired two years ago.
The Asia Pacific beer market is predicted to grow to $219 billion by 2022, up from $181 billion in 2017, according to Euromonitor.
AB InBev had 49 percent market share in 2017 in South Korea, where it owns brands like Cass, Euromonitor data show. The company bought South Korean brewer Oriental Brewery Co. in 2014 for $5.8 billion, regaining a business that it had sold to private equity several years earlier.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 06:49AM ET</span>","After Monsanto patent ruling, Indian farmers hope for next-gen GM seeds","By Rajendra Jadhav and Mayank Bhardwaj
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Monsanto's victory this week in a patent case in India regarding genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds has raised hopes among farmers that the company will now launch its next-generation seeds.
India approved Monsanto's GM cotton seed trait in 2002 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber. But newer traits have not been available since the company withdrew an application in 2016 seeking approval for the latest variety due to a royalty dispute with the government and worries over patent claims. (https://reut.rs/2jbDq80)
Nevertheless, the new herbicide-tolerant variety seeped into Indian farms and many cotton growers openly sowed them last year, prompting a government investigation that is ongoing.  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) has said local seed companies have illegally attempted to ""incorporate unauthorized and unapproved herbicide-tolerant technologies into their seeds"".
""We don't understand legal issues but we want new technologies,"" Shrikant Kale, a cotton grower in Yavatmal district in the western state of Maharashtra, said by phone. ""If the court verdict helps seed companies in bringing new technology, then it would be good for us as well.""
Nearly a dozen other farmers in three Maharashtra districts said they planted the illegal cotton variety in June after buying seeds from the gray market, and that they would be happy to use it legally if Monsanto launched it.
""Illegal sales mean that there's always a risk of buying spurious seeds and we buy such smuggled seeds as there is no alternative,"" said Vijay Niwal, another cotton farmer in Maharashtra.
""We don't mind paying a few hundred rupees more for seeds if they help us in saving thousands of rupees on managing weeds.""
India's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Monsanto can claim patents on its GM cotton seeds, after the company appealed an earlier ruling by the Delhi High Court that the world's biggest seed maker could not claim such patents.
Monsanto owner Bayer (DE:BAYGn) welcomed the Supreme Court's decision. It said in a statement to Reuters on Friday that it was confident of ""defending any challenge to our patent by presenting solid scientific evidence"", and that the company would seek a ruling on ""infringement of the patent"" in India.
Asked about plans to launch new products in India, Bayer said: ""Protection of intellectual property encourages innovation that is essential to providing India’s farmers with access to breakthrough technologies"".
But two industry sources aware of the company's plans said that a dispute over royalties paid by local companies that license its technology remained a hurdle to seeking fresh approval to sell a new variety of cotton seeds. India's agriculture ministry has twice slashed royalties in the past two years, apart from cutting cotton seed prices.
""The government could step in again to decide the rate of royalty, which could be really miniscule in comparison with the cost of developing a really good product,"" said one of the sources, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
""Biotechnology research is very expensive and if the government arbitrarily fixes the rate for expensive, cutting-edge technologies then that becomes a major hurdle in launching new products.""
The agriculture ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment.
""SELF-RELIANCE"" GROUP
The court ruling has been criticized by a nationalist group that has links to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and favors non-GM technologies and ""India first"" economic policies. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which loosely translates to National Forum for Self-Reliance, said the government needs to amend the country's patent law to negate the court verdict.
Industry executives say several foreign agrichemical companies had to scale down projects, fire scientists, or pull applications to sell products in India because of government-mandated cuts in royalties and a lower court's order in April that rejected Monsanto's patent claim.
They said the Supreme Court verdict overturning the lower court order could set a precedent for any future patent dispute and encourage fresh investments in one of the world's biggest farm markets, whose seed industry is worth around $3 billion a year.
""The entire biotechnology space has been liberated,"" said Ram Kaundinya, director general of the Federation of Seed Industry of India that represents foreign and local seed companies including Monsanto and Syngenta .
""There was uncertainty in this area for the last three to four years, which led to a reduction in investments. There are still some issues regarding price control but those are not as big as validity of patents.""
Many biotechnology companies working on corn and other GM crops will now push hard to get government approvals for their seeds, he said, declining to name the companies.
DowDuPont (N:DWDP), which in August last year told the Indian government it was putting off trials needed for approval to sell a GM corn variety, did not respond to a call seeking comment.
A public relations firm for Syngenta directed Reuters to Kaundinya for comment.
But permitting GM food crops is a big call for India, which so far only allows genetically modified cotton seeds.
The country spends tens of billions of dollars in importing food, as dated technologies, poor yields, shrinking farms and unreliable weather patterns afflict the country of 1.3 billion people. But opponents of GM crops say they threaten the country's biodiversity and are too expensive for Indian farmers.
Annual sales of GM cotton seeds is estimated at $500 million, and Monsanto-developed seeds now control 90 percent of India's cotton acreage.

Prosecutors had asked for a jail sentence of 10 years for Castellucci, who is also chief executive of Benetton-controlled infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL). 
Castellucci has already said he will be stepping down as CEO of Autostrade after a 13-year tenure.
The 59-year old manager is also under investigation for multiple manslaughter after a bridge operated by the company collapsed in Genoa in August, killing 43 people.
After the Genoa disaster, the Italian government blamed Autostrade for poor maintenance of the viaduct and threatened to revoke all of Autostrade's motorway concessions in the country.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",EU's plan to reduce states' blocking powers on tax to be subject to veto,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to fail to break the EU deadlock on tax reforms as it is planning to give states a veto right on a proposal meant to end governments' blocking powers on the matter. 
The move, scheduled to be unveiled on Tuesday, would come after EU states failed last month to agree on a common levy on digital multinationals which stand accused of paying too little tax by routing their profits to smaller, low-tax countries of the bloc, like Ireland or Luxembourg.
Decisions on tax matters at EU level require the unanimous backing of the 28 member states, which on other issues usually decide by a majority vote.
A long-neglected treaty article allows the commission to compel states to drop the unanimity rule when competition in the EU market is distorted. Invoking this rule would allow decisions on tax reforms to be made by majority.
But, after having considered triggering the article, the EU's executive is now expected to make its plan subject to the unanimous backing of EU states, three EU officials said, meaning it is unlikely to be approved.
Smaller states have for years used the veto power to block tax overhauls at EU level over fears of losing tax revenues.
The switch to majority voting has been threatened for years by the Commission in a bid to break the stalemate.
Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, flagged this plan for the first time in 2017 but no concrete proposal has been made so far. The commission's five-year mandate ends this year. 
Juncker has said that he would be in favor of moving to majority voting in sectors such as sales tax, digital taxes, financial transaction levies and the harmonization of EU countries' tax bases, which would reduce governments' tools for attracting firms with tax sweeteners.

Reforms under discussion would leave EU states the power of setting tax rates at a national level in most areas.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 06:04AM ET</span>","Investors plow billions into stocks, bonds and EM assets as risk appetite returns: BAML","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors plowed money back into stocks and bonds this week as they regained their appetite for risk, boosted by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, their biggest in 11 weeks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday, citing data from EPFR on flows in the week to Jan. 9. 
Some $7.2 billion flowed into bond funds, the biggest taking in 39 weeks. 
BAML's ""Bull/Bear"" gauge of investor positioning fell to 1.8 last week, what the strategists called ""extreme bear territory"", triggering a ""buy"" signal for equities.
""Initial skepticism on size and duration of rally... quickly morphed into chase via stocks in EM and U.S. but not Europe,"" BAML strategists wrote, commenting on feedback from clients after the signal.
The gauge crawled back up to 2.2, or ""neutral"" territory, this week.
In the U.S., growth stocks and large-cap stocks drew the biggest inflows with $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion respectively, while $700 million evaporated from value stocks.
Comments from Powell stressing that the U.S. central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases have triggered relief among investors who were fretting continued rate rises may be a mistake.
In another sign of healthy risk appetite, emerging market assets were popular with both equity and bond funds drawing in $2.4 billion, while high-yield bond funds received $1.5 billion inflows. 
Europe remained unpopular with $100 million outflows. European equity funds have suffered outflows in 43 of the past 44 weeks.
In sectors, investors pulled $600 million from tech stocks and $1.5 billion from financials stocks. They also dumped $1.4 billion of investment-grade bonds.
What could sustain the risk rally is inflows to credit funds, strategists said. These would signal that the Fed ""has short-circuited vicious cycle of higher credit spreads and weaker growth"", they wrote. 
""Green shoots"" from Asian or European macroeconomic data would also help support further gains, they added. 

European stocks climbed to a one-month high on Friday and eyed their fourth straight day of gains, which would be their longest winning streak since November.

LONDON (Reuters) - Soothing sounds from the world's top central banks helped stocks maintain their strong start to the year on Friday, while another leap from China's yuan capped its best week since being cut loose from the dollar in 2005.
With more promises of patience from Federal Reserve, the ECB mulling another dump of cheap money and news that trade talks between Washington and Beijing are moving to higher levels, the Friday feeling was in full effect.
Asia had crawled to a 5-week high overnight thanks to China and Japan, and European stocks were up for what could be the fourth straight day of gains and longest winning streak since September. 
The Fed's dovish stance also pushed down the dollar and nudged Treasury yields lower after five days of gains again. That cheered emerging markets and confidence more generally having been flattened during the brutal end to 2018.
""Equities are having a good run after a pretty horrible end to last year,"" said Rabobank quantitative analyst Bas Van Geffen.
""It is the changing wording of the Fed, it seems to be making more and more room for an eventual pause (in the rate hike cycle)"". 
The index of Europe's leading 300 shares (FTEU3) was up 0.3 percent in early trade at 1377 points, its highest in almost a month. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.1 percent and France's CAC (FCHI) was up 0.2 percent at 4814 points. 
The big gainer among Europe's leading indices was Britain's FTSE (FTSE), up 0.7 percent at 6992 points on the back of the latest slide in sterling against the euro on mounting Brexit uncertainty. 
Wall Street's strong performance on Thursday was another positive driver. The S&P 500 (SPX) is now up more than 10 percent from its Dec. 26 low, and futures point to another rise at the open on Friday. 
At the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday, Fed chief Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank would be patient about hiking interest rates.
""The word 'patient' is used often when the Fed's policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, economist at Nomura Securities.
""Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there's no reason China would not want to accept it,"" he added.
U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will ""most likely"" visit Washington later in January for trade talks too.
YUAN LEAP
In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was on course for its fourth straight weekly fall against other top world currencies having also hit a three-month low the previous day. 
The flip side was that the Japanese yen  was a shade higher again at 108.29 per dollar and the euro was up at $1.1530 (EUR=) on course for its best week since August.
It is China's yuan that has been the real mover though. Against the backdrop of the sensitive trade negotiations, the Chinese currency has risen 1.8 percent this week which is its biggest gain since July 2005 when Beijing abandoned the yuan's peg to the dollar.
Yuan traders had started offloading dollars in their proprietary accounts on Thursday following the wrap-up of three-day U.S.-China trade talks in Beijing. Markets treated absence of any bad news from those negotiations as good news.
""Some corporate clients were joining to sell their dollars,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. 
Bond markets have been turning too. U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell's comments on the Fed ""substantially"" reducing the size of its balance sheet. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.728 percent. 
Crude prices held near four-week highs, lifted by optimism on U.S.-China talks and as OPEC-led crude output cuts started to tighten supply.

In early European trade West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.9 percent at $53.07 per barrel, the highest level in almost a month. Brent crude futures traded at $62.18 per barrel, up 0.8 percent on the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan ex-Chairman Carlos Ghosn has requested his release on bail after being indicted in Tokyo on Friday on two new charges, his lawyers said, as the once-feted auto executive awaits a lengthy criminal trial that could be as long as six months away.
Ghosn was the overlord of an alliance that included Nissan Motor (T:7201), Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), until his surprise November arrest and removal as chairman of both Japanese automakers sent shockwaves through the industry.
The former executive, lauded for rescuing Nissan from the financial brink two decades ago, was charged with aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008.
Ghosn, former Representative Director Greg Kelly and Nissan itself were also charged for understating Ghosn's income for three years through March 2018. The three parties have already been indicted for the same charge covering the years 2010-2015.
Ghosn and Kelly have denied all charges. Nissan said it regretted any concern caused to its stakeholders.
It is rare in Japan for defendants who deny their charges to be granted bail ahead of trial. Kelly posted bail on Christmas Day and is unable to leave Japan without special permission. Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, expects his client to be held until trial, which he said could begin in about six months. 
If bail is granted, Ghosn - who is suffering from fever, according to his lawyer - would not likely be released until Tuesday given that Monday is public holiday.
Kelly, a Ghosn ally, was hospitalized for treatment of a pre-existing neck problem after his release and has since been discharged, said his lawyer Yoichi Kitamura.
""This second indictment for Kelly comes as no surprise as it merely makes what was a five year period for the first into eight years,"" Kitamura said.
Kitamura said he expects Ghosn and Kelly to be tried together on the two charges of understating income, and that he will work closely with Ghosn's legal team.
NISSAN COMPLAINT
Also on Friday, Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against its former leader.
The automaker, in a statement, said it filed the complaint ""on the basis of Ghosn's misuse of a significant amount of the company's funds. Nissan does not in any way tolerate such misconduct and calls for strict penalties.""
Ghosn, 64, appeared in court on Tuesday for the first time since his arrest, looking thinner and greyer. He denied the allegations, calling them ""meritless"" and ""unsubstantiated"".
He said he had asked Nissan to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contracts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. He said he did so to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral.
Ghosn's lawyer Otsuru on Tuesday said Nissan had agreed to the arrangement on condition that any losses or gains would be Ghosn's. Ghosn said the contracts were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss.

On Thursday, the boards of Nissan and controlling shareholder Renault - where Ghosn remains chairman - met for an update on the matter. Nissan later said it remained committed to the alliance.

The discounting, as steep as $118 for the recently launched 64GB iPhone XR, is the latest sign that Apple's weak holiday sales in China may have extended to the current quarter. 
The price cuts on iPhones by Chinese retailers began in the middle of this week, with at least six offering promotions this weekend, according to checks done by Reuters. 
Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Prices for iPhones sold through its Chinese website remained unchanged.
Such widespread price cuts are not uncommon around shopping festivals like Single's Day in November, but these cuts stand out as they affect Apple's latest XS and XR models that were released only months ago, said Mo Jia, a Canalys analyst who tracks China's smartphone industry.
Jia believes Apple itself could have lowered prices of the phones it ships to distributors, or that distributors may have slashed rates in order to move more units. 
""It's possible Apple wants to test the market's feedback if it brings down the channel prices. Or, Apple might be under pressure to clean out its stock of iPhones,"" he said.
Apple has been trailing local competitors such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] that offer cheaper options in China, home to the world's biggest smartphone market in terms of shipment volume.
Last week, Apple issued its first revenue warning in nearly 12 years, citing poor Chinese demand, sending its shares down 10 percent, their biggest intra-day fall in six years.
STEEP DISCOUNTS 
Suning announced on Friday that it would start selling the 64GB iPhone XR for 5,699 yuan, 800 yuan ($118.46) less than the device's sticker price in China. It is also selling the 64GB version of the iPhone 8 for 3,899 yuan, a 1,200 yuan discount.
JD.com, a major online seller of consumer electronics, is offering promotions on models going back to the 8 series. Dangdang, one of its rivals, has launched a similar campaign. 
Brick-and-mortar retailer GOME Retail Holdings (HK:0493) has discounted a range of iPhone models, while several authorized Apple resellers on Tmall, a marketplace run by e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA), are set to offer discounts on Sunday.
Qian Chao, a district manager for Shanghai-based iPhone distributor DoubleRise Beijing Technology, said it was the company's decision to make the price cuts and that it had not received any official notice from Apple.
Apple's China woes come against the backdrop of a broader slowdown in demand for gadgets across the tech sector as the country's economic growth slows, exacerbated by Beijing's festering trade war with the United States.
According to government data, smartphone shipments dropped 15.5 percent annually in the country in 2018. Domestic Chinese brands, meanwhile, have won over local consumers with a wide range of devices at competitive price points.

SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Crisis talks between India's cash-strapped Jet Airways Ltd (NS:JET) and aircraft lessors have failed to ease a row over late payments, prompting some lessors to explore taking back aircraft, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
In what one of the people described as an ill-tempered showdown between the airline and some of the world's leading leasing firms, Jet's main lender  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) sought to provide reassurance that India's biggest full-service carrier is doing all it can to pay its staff, suppliers and creditors.
""Jet has been delinquent for many months. Nobody wants to get in a situation where the problems worsen and it becomes even more difficult to take out aircraft,"" one of the people said.
Jet controls over a sixth of a market experiencing an unprecedented boom in air travel. Yet high fuel taxes, a weak rupee and price competition have squeezed profitability, leaving Jet with 80.52 billion rupees ($1.14 billion) in net debt as at the end of September and defaulting on payments.
The airline had previously told some lessors it would clear arrears by Dec. 31, but was unable do so, the people close to the matter said.

At meetings on Tuesday, held at SBI's headquarters in Mumbai's business district, the bank's Chairman Rajnish Kumar was asked how Jet planned to raise equity or debt, said one of the people - an attendee, who found the responses lacked sufficient detail.
Other attendees included Jet's management team, including the airline's founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal, as well as a senior adviser of Etihad Airways, which owns 24 percent of Jet and which did not provide any assurances, the person said.
An official from  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) later said lenders have ""in-principle"" agreed to extend some help to Jet, but details on the mechanics of it are still being worked out.
Some lessors have engaged with lawyers, are working with their technical teams about repossession and are monitoring the planes, but the situation could be complicated by a new bankruptcy law that allows up to 270 days where no action is permitted against the debtor or its assets, the person said.
Lessors such as GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) SMBC Aviation Capital and Jackson Square (NYSE:SQ) are looking into stopping the transfer of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets that had been due for delivery to Jet, the person said.
A second person said deliveries of 737 MAX jets from lessors had been behind schedule since November.
Avolon, DAE Aerospace, BOC Aviation Ltd <2558.HK> and  Aircastle Ltd  (N:AYR) also attended the meetings along with GECAS and SMBC, one of the people said, declining to specify which are considering reclaiming planes.
Jet Airways, in a statement on Friday, said the airline is working on its turnaround strategy and updating its partners, in real time, on efforts taken to improve its liquidity.
""A comprehensive plan that will ensure business sustainability, preserve value, and enable the company to honor its obligations was outlined,"" a Jet spokesman said in the statement, adding that the meeting took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual appreciation.
The turnaround plan involves creating a competitive cost structure and restructuring the balance sheet, among other things, and is expected to ""deliver a positive impact on the financials of the company,"" he said. 
SBI and SMBC Aviation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DAE Aerospace, GECAS, Aircastle and Jackson Square did not respond outside of regular business hours. Etihad, BOC Aviation and Avolon declined to comment.
The people familiar with the talks were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified.
FINANCIAL HELP
Jet, controlled by Goyal, has turned to Etihad for financial help. However, the Abu Dhabi airline is not ""in any position to sink new equity into Jet at this juncture,"" said a person familiar with Etihad's position.
Etihad posted a ""significant loss"" at the end of last year that would continue into 2019, according to an internal memo seen by sources on Thursday. The memo also showed 50 pilots would lose their jobs as the airline cut costs.
Jet held talks with Indian conglomerate Tata Sons Ltd [TATAS.UL] about financial aid last year. Sources told Reuters that Goyal ended the talks because Tata would have wanted him to step down or take a less prominent role.
A source close to Tata on Thursday said there had been no recent engagement with Jet and doing so was ""extremely unlikely"" because Tata people had ""moved on internally"".
Tata Sons declined to comment on Friday.
REPOSSESSION
After the disorderly collapse of  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments.
Lessors can file a complaint with the government which has the power to cancel the registration of a plane within five working days and allow lessors to repossess it subject to certain conditions, including unpaid dues on the aircraft.
Some laws conflict with full implementation of the convention and the government in October said it was consulting to revise those laws - a move that could reduce lease rates for Indian carriers. Nevertheless, the ability to repossess a plane can be a more complicated process in India than in some other countries.
On Tuesday, Jet proposed to creditors that it would catch up with debt payments in arrears as of September, and from April meet debt payments as they come due, showed a document seen by Reuters.
Jet's debt payments will be large over the next few years, starting with about 17 billion rupees due by March-end, credit-ratings firm ICRA said in a Jan. 2 research note.

Danske Bank is already under investigation by authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) made through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Bill Browder, founder and CEO of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, told reporters on Thursday he had asked French authorities to investigate Danske over alleged money laundering, rather than treating it as a witness. [nL8N1ZA5S2}
Following media coverage of Browder's press meeting the bank issued an update on the French investigation on Friday.
The bank has this month received a letter from an investigating judge of the French Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris court summoning it to an interview, stating that the judge envisages placing it under formal investigation, Danske said.
""As a result, Danske Bank may again become subject to formal investigation instead of being an assisted witness,"" it said.
The investigation is into alleged organized laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion and includes transactions worth around 28 million euros ($32 million) between 2007 and 2014, Danske Bank said.
The bank was charged with violating French anti-money laundering legislation in October 2017, but its status was changed to that of ""assisted witness"" in January 2018.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 03:00AM ET</span>","Indonesia's plans to regulate ride-hailing rates threaten Grab, Go-Jek models","By Cindy Silviana and Fanny Potkin
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is preparing to launch regulations fixing the rates drivers and riders for ride-hailing services such as Grab and Go-Jek receive, two government officials said this week, creating potential obstacles for the companies' expansion. 
The regulations would meet drivers demands for more oversight and higher rates but there are concerns that the rising costs to the companies could stifle their development as they battle to dominate the ride-hailing market in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 
Singapore-based Grab and home grown Go-Jek have been locked in price wars in Indonesia, part of a wider fight to bring banking, e-commerce, ride-hailing, food-delivery and other services to every corner of Southeast Asia. 
However, since 2018, motorcycle taxi drivers working for Grab and Go-Jek in Jakarta have held protest rallies calling for higher fares and better conditions.
Indonesia's Ministry of Transportation plans to implement minimum and maximum tariffs for car and motor bike ride-hailing that will be ""higher than Go-Jek and Grab's current rates"" and impose limits on promotional price cuts, said Budi Setyadi, director general of land transportation at the ministry.
""This is for the safety and protection of drivers,"" he said. 
The ministry's Public Transportation Director Ahmad Yani said a dependency on incentive-driven payments and low fixed rates per kilometre was a safety risk as it led to drivers overworking.
Yani said Grab paid 1,200 rupiah ($0.085) per km (0.6 miles) with a focus on bonuses, while Go-Jek's rate was 1,400 rupiah ($0.099) per km.
The officials said fixed fare ranges for motor bikes were still being finalised, but would be implemented from March. 
Fixed rates for ride-hailing cars will start in June and be set at 3,500 to 6,000 rupiah ($0.43) per km in the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Bali.
The drivers were pushing for increases to a standard fare of 3,000 to 4,000 rupiah per km.
NEW RULES
The firms told Reuters they welcomed the new rules, though they had not seen details of the motor bike regulations.
""Grab believes the government will develop the best regulatory framework and hopes that all stakeholders will be included in the process,"" said the company's Head of Public Affairs Tri Sukma Anreianno.
A Go-Jek spokesman said: ""We support the government's spirit to encourage our driver partners ... and hope the regulation will have a positive impact on the sustainability of drivers' income ... and fair business competition.""
However, both transport officials said the companies are worried about the pending regulation since they have spent heavily on driver subsidies to slash their customer rates and build their businesses. 
""Grab and Go-Jek have told me they would prefer there was no regulation,"" said Yani. ""Due to the competition between them ... they are scared what could happen if they don't keep up with each other.""
Indonesia's Supreme Court blocked a previous transport ministry attempt to fix ride-hailing rates in 2017 after drivers sued saying the rules favored the taxi firms.
Both ministry officials said the new regulations met anti-competition standards and followed extensive discussions with driver syndicates. 
Grab and Go-Jek drivers welcomed the prospect of standard fares. 
""I have been working for Grab since 2015. Before, I could earn 300,000 to 400,000 rupiah per day. Now, I can only get 150,000 rupiah,"" said Grab motor bike chauffeur Hermansyah.
Another driver, who had worked for both companies, said neither provided much protection, leading drivers to bear operational costs. He asked not to be identified since he had a role in organizing protests. 
The fixed rates will be a challenge to a business model that has depended on cheap passenger prices for growth and could undermine innovation.
""Cheap fares has been the firms' main way to attract customers,"" said Yayat Suprityatna, Urban and Transportation Observer at Trisakti University in Jakarta.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 02:45AM ET</span>",China's Wanda files for U.S. IPO of sports unit to raise up to $500 million: sources,"HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has filed confidentially for a U.S. initial public offering of its sports unit that could fetch up to $500 million, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The company made the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the listing, which could happen in the first half of this year, the sources said.
The IPO could raise between $300 million and $500 million, the people said, though one cautioned that $500 million might be high.
A Wanda spokesman did not provide any immediate comment.
Wanda's sprawling business empire ranges from real estate to sport to cinemas, but it has been rattled in the past years by a government-led crackdown on overseas deals and high leverage. 
The company owned by Wang Jianlin, one of China's richest men, has since started offloading domestic and overseas holdings, including stakes in cinema operator AMC Entertainment and Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid and a handful of property developments.
Other Chinese conglomerates such as HNA group and Fosun International (HK:0656) have also faced government pressure to cut down on what Beijing has termed irrational overseas deals.
An IPO of Wanda's sports assets would include Infront Sports & Media AG, a Swiss sports marketing company and World Triathlon Corp, the organizer and promoter of the Ironman race, three sources previously told Reuters.
The two were acquired in 2015 for $1.2 billion and $650 million respectively. Wanda, while preparing the IPO, had also received offers for the businesses from a number of private equity firms, Reuters reported.
 Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) are working on the deal, the sources said. Citigroup and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chinese companies have dominated the ranks of those looking to go public worldwide, raising $58.2 billion in IPOs last year, accounting for 29 percent of global issuers, according to Refinitiv data.
They have also been very active in U.S. listings, raising $9.1 billion last year, the highest level since 2014, Refinitiv data showed.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 02:28AM ET</span>",How Santander's Brazil unit is driving growth with car loans,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At BM Multimarcas, a used-car dealer on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, owner Santel de Abreu Bernardo can show you jalopies that most big banks would not touch.
There is a faded blue 2003  Renault  (PA:RENA) hatchback with 195,000 kilometers on the dial. And a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Gol Turbo so old that it could vote.
But when he needs to seal a deal, Bernardo has a go-to option for financing: the Brazilian unit of Spain's  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN).
It has grabbed 25 percent of the market for car loans in Latin America's largest country, in part by extending credit to borrowers shunned by other mainstream banks. That means financing working-class customers in need of cheap motorcycles and cars up to two decades old.
That business helped power Madrid-based Santander through Brazil's recent deep recession, even as domestic rivals Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA hit the brakes, and other foreign banks such as London-based HSBC Plc and U.S.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) sold their struggling Brazilian retail businesses.
There are risks to Santander's strategy, as any used-car veteran will tell you.
""When an old car breaks down, its owner prefers spending money to fix it rather than paying down debt,"" said Bernardo of BM Multimarcas. ""That's why many banks don't like financing old cars.""
Yet Santander, Brazil's third-largest private-sector bank, is cruising. Its 90-day default ratio is the lowest among Brazil's largest private banks, at 2.9 percent in September.
Year-over-year consumer loan growth in Brazil hit 22.6 percent in September, more than triple the industry average of 7 percent. Brazil unit profitability, which for years has lagged peers, jumped to 19.4 percent from 16.3 percent in the same period. That beat Bradesco, the country's second-largest private lender, and narrowed the gap with industry-leading Itau. 
Santander’s increasing reliance on Brazil shows how emerging markets can still provide a jolt of growth. The Brazilian unit contributed 26 percent of group profits in the first nine months of 2018, up from 19 percent four years ago. Santander Brasil's stock price has surged more than two thirds in the last 12 months, vastly outperforming the shares of its parent company, as well as those of Itau and Bradesco.
Still, Santander Brasil's outsized auto loan portfolio, and its willingness to bet on borrowers and vehicles avoided by competitors, could presage a bumpier road ahead in a country with a history of economic volatility.
""Certainly, Santander's growth strategy is a success story so far,"" said Andre Martins, an analyst at XP Investimentos. ""But the bank will be the one most exposed to defaults if the Brazilian economy turns down.""
(For a graphic on Santander Brasil's share of auto loans in Brazil, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2GtCxFR) 
RISK MANAGEMENT
For now, Brazil's economy appears to be on the upswing. And Santander executives say their strategy is battle-tested.
Around 80 percent of the Brazil unit's auto loans are on cars aged four years or less, and down payments are hefty, averaging 36 percent.
""If Santander's loan book were problematic, it would already have popped after a 3-year historic recession,"" said Angel Santodomingo, chief financial officer for Santander Brasil. ""Our success in credit quality is related to our ability to analyze and price individuals' risk.""
Santodomingo would not reveal Santander's secret sauce. But the bank is harnessing big data to glean information beyond borrower income and savings. And Brazil risk officers are using company tools that have proven successful elsewhere, including the United States, where Santander is a major subprime auto lender.
The bank has also embraced the internet to grow its business, leveraging online sales generated through WebMotors, a top car-selling website that it owns.
Two years ago it launched an app that allows dealers to arrange car loans within minutes for buyers who provide eight pieces of information, an innovation that is now being copied by other Brazilian banks. That process had previously taken at least a day and required car buyers to provide reams of documentation. If a loan is approved, clients sign the contract digitally.
""It saves a lot of time,"" said Eduardo de Jesus, a salesman at Basile Center Car, located in a middle-class neighborhood on Sao Paulo's northwest side. 
Santander plans to use that model to grow its consumer finance business in Brazil with loans for vacations, building materials and solar panels, according to Andre Novaes, head of Santander's consumer finance unit. Many Brazilian banks have avoided such lending because of the high default risk and shaky collateral. 
To safeguard its portfolio, Santander said it has encouraged highly-indebted clients to refinance and consolidate different types of loans in arrears into a single loan with more amicable terms.
Some bankers, however, view the practice as a way to mask Santander’s default ratio.
Severe losses in 2011 forced Itau and Bradesco to stop financing low-end motorcycles, and to ban cars aged ten years and older from their portfolios. They also increased down payments and shortened loan maturities, which had stretched as long as 70 months.
RIAL AT THE HELM
Santander has been in Brazil since 1982. It has made a few good-sized acquisitions, including the purchase of the Brazil unit of Amsterdam-based ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) in 2007. 
But most of its organic growth spurt has come under Sergio Rial, who took the CEO job at Santander Brasil in January 2016.
A lawyer and economist, Rial served a stint as chief financial officer at the grains trader Cargill Inc and as a board member at ABN AMRO. He was chief executive of the Brazilian meatpacker Marfrig when Ana Botin, the executive chairman of Santander Group, tapped him for the top job in Brazil.(Santander Brasil share's outperform rivals: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ADY3Cx)
While car loans have juiced growth, Rial has also bet on safer credit lines, including payroll loans and mortgages, as well as credit cards. Overall, Rial has been strengthening Santander's retail arm to the detriment of corporate loans. Consumer loans comprise 70 percent of the bank's loan book, up 12 percentage points from when Rial took the CEO post.
To engage the bank's employees, Rial has tied more of their compensation to performance; variable compensation increased 16 percent from 2015 to 2017 even as the bank's payroll shrunk roughly 7 percent. The number of clients has increased for 40 straight months, reaching 23.4 million in September.
Still, the auto loan business remains the bank's standout in terms of growth. De Jesus, the car salesman at Basile Center Car, said Santander's rivals are paying attention. 
""When clients come to a store, they want to know exactly if the down payment suits their pockets, and Santander's tools show it immediately,"" he said. ""Other banks are copying it now.""

ValueAct, which started investing in Olympus more than a year ago, emerged as a major shareholder in May with a 5.04 percent stake.
""The governance changes Olympus announced today will better enable the board to support and supervise management in their implementation of Olympus's strategy to become a global leader in the medical technology Industry,"" Hale said separately.

The bank, which will earn fees and gain a captive client base for its foreign exchange business, could offer existing corporate clients more on deposits if they sign up for Goldman's cash management services, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters. 
Long considered a low-margin, utility-like service, the wholesale payments and cash management business generated about $250 billion in global revenue in 2017 for big banks, according to management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
The steady stream of income has grown more attractive to banks that have been shifting away from volatile areas such as trading and investment banking in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago. 
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK),  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA),  Standard Chartered  PLC (L:STAN) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) currently dominate the market, handling corporations' payments and receivables across different regions. 
As Goldman seeks to grow stable revenue by adding a cash management service for clients whom it already offers hedging and strategic advice, the investment bank further evolves to match rival universal banks' range of businesses.

However, rivals privately scoff at the idea Goldman can gain significant market share in a business where contracts often last five years, clients tend to stick with their banks and a global network of banking licenses greases the wheels. 
""The regulatory and operational costs of building a global cash management platform will be very steep and will take many years to achieve the scale that will justify the costs,"" said a senior commercial banker at a large European bank. 
""Large multinational companies are consolidating the number of banks they deal with, and they don't tend to switch service providers frequently for workday functions like facilitating supplier payments and managing payrolls."" 
FIRST CLIENT
Nonetheless, Goldman believes it can make inroads. 
Its investment bankers have heard corporate treasurers at big U.S. multinational corporations complain that other banks' systems are clunky and outdated, one person familiar with Goldman's plans said. Goldman will try to woo those accounts with a user-friendly interface and other improvements, and eventually hopes to be the third or fourth bank corporate clients use, in addition to other banks, for cash management.
Later this year, Goldman will become its own first client by moving its deposits from other banks onto its own cash management platform. Goldman stands to earn money from cash management in three ways: fees earned for processing funds, fees earned on exchanging a client's cash into other currencies during a transaction, and by using deposits as operational account balances, a cheaper alternative to wholesale funding.
Oliver Wyman predicts that wholesale payments and cash management revenue will grow 5 percent annually over the next five years. Growing volumes and rising interest rates will more than offset narrowing profit margins caused by increased competition, the consulting firm said. 
Paying clients more for deposits and offering new technology is a strategy Goldman used when it launched Marcus, its online retail bank, in 2016. 
It has paid off. Marcus had $30 billion of deposits in the United States and the United Kingdom and $4 billion in loans as of November, and is contributing about $200 million to Goldman's revenue, according to a November presentation. 
In recent months, Goldman has advertised that it is hiring cash management compliance, technology, and legal professionals. 

In one LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post seeking applications for lead data architect in the commercial banking engineering team, Goldman said it was looking for ""innovative solutions to traditional banking activities"" by combining the ""heritage of a 148-year-old financial institution with the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of a tech start-up.""

1229,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>","Hitachi Sees $2.8 Billion Hit on U.K. Nuclear Halt, Nikkei Says","(Bloomberg) -- Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd. will halt work on a nuclear power project in the U.K. and take a one-time charge as negotiations with the British government over funding stalled, the Nikkei reported. Shares in Tokyo rallied the most in more than two years.
The company will book a loss of between 200 billion yen and 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) after freezing assets of its British nuclear business and writing down their value, the Nikkei reported without attribution.
Investors applauded signs the company may distance itself from the nuclear power industry -- which has been saddled by cost overruns, stiff competition from cheaper fuels and tougher regulations -- as well as the Brexit turmoil that has consumed the government of Prime Minister Theresa May.
“What investors want is increased profit and a lot of synergy to be captured in the near to medium term, and not long-term projects that could escalate and blowout in terms of costs,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in Tokyo. “If Hitachi was able to guarantee the on time completion of the project and secure attractive financing of the project with the U.K. government, then perhaps nuclear is possible.”
Shares in Tokyo rose as much as 8.9 percent, the biggest intraday jump since November 2016. The company eased back to a 8.5 percent gain as of 1:59 p.m. local time, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in the broader Topix Index.
Nuclear Plans
Hitachi said in response to questions from Bloomberg News that it’s reviewing the project and it hasn’t made a final decision. The Nikkei report said the company’s board will make a decision next week and cited an unidentified executive saying the project isn’t being abandoned entirely and could be restarted in the future.
The conglomerate would join the ranks of Japanese companies including Toshiba Corp. that are shifting away from the nuclear power sector as project costs balloon and demand shrinks in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. It also follows Hitachi Ltd.’s move last month to take over ABB Ltd.’s power grid division for about $6.4 billion as it shifts toward the higher-growth market for electricity networks.
The reported decision also leaves the U.K. with a dwindling number of potential partners to help fund a revival of its aging nuclear fleet. A decision over the nation’s marquee 18 billion-pound ($23 billion) Hinkley Point C project in 2016 was stalled as May’s government reviewed the project, sparking speculation there were concerns over its reliance on the participation of Chinese state-owned companies.
According to the Nikkei report, Hitachi was struggling to find Japanese investors to help fund its development and had approached London for further support. Those negotiations made no progress, it said.
Recent Japanese media reports reflected support for the Wylfa Newydd project in Anglesey, Wales, had been waning. The Yomiuri newspaper in December reported the company had informed the Japanese government it may freeze the project. The company’s U.K. unit, Horizon Nuclear Power Ltd., also plans a second project in Oldbury, near Bristol in southwest England, which the Nikkei report didn’t mention. Hitachi said in 2017 that it was in discussions with multiple parties about selling a stake in Horizon to reduce the financial risks of building the reactors.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 11:46PM ET</span>",Alphabet board sued on allegations of sexual misconduct cover-up,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two shareholder lawsuits filed this week accused the board of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc of playing a direct role in covering up sexual misconduct claims against two former executives over the last five years.
The company declined to comment.
Both of the lawsuits seek to force Google to change its governance and oversight to stop future workplace conduct issues. They also call for Alphabet directors to pay damages to Alphabet for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties and engaging in corporate waste.
The allegations stem primarily from large severance payments to Andy Rubin, who led Google's Android mobile operating division until 2014, and Amit Singhal, head of Google's search unit until 2016. Company investigations into both men had found accusations of sexual harassment against them to be credible, according to the lawsuits.
Rubin and Singhal have denied the allegations. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai apologized last year to employees for the companies' past handling of sexual misconduct cases and vowed to improve practices. https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/note-our-employees
One of the two lawsuits in San Mateo County Superior Court in California cites minutes from Alphabet board and board committee meetings where the executives' situations were discussed. 
Plaintiff James Martin obtained the documents through a ""shareholder inspection demand,"" according to the lawsuit. Google provided them on the condition they not be published, according to his attorneys, and details from the minutes are redacted across at least eight pages in the 82-page lawsuit filed on Thursday.
Martin's attorney, Frank Bottini, said his team plans to show that Google suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damages including payouts made to executives accused of sexual misconduct, lost productivity from employees around the world walking off the job briefly in November to protest the payouts and hits to its brand reputation.
The employee demonstrations followed a New York Times report in October that said Google in 2014 gave a $90 million exit package to Rubin.
Ellen Winick Stross, an attorney for Rubin, said on Thursday that Martin's lawsuit, ""like much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes Andy’s departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his ex-wife. Andy left Google voluntarily. Andy denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court.""
Employee organizers said they welcomed the lawsuits as they continue to push for further changes, including an employee representative on Alphabet's board.
The lawsuit calls for Alphabet to add at least three independent directors to its board and move to a ""one share, one vote"" stock structure to increase shareholder oversight of management decisions. Alphabet executives currently hold voting control through shares with 10 votes each.
""We'd like to see ... meaningful change in the tone at the company, the policies, the treatment of women, the reporting of sexual harassment and other issues,"" Bottini said. 

The second case, brought on Wednesday by Northern California Pipe Trades Pension Plan and Teamsters Local 272 Labor Management Pension Fund, cites company filings and media reports. They are represented by the law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll.

The movements in U.S. stocks came despite Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he is “very worried” about growing amount of U.S. debts.
""I'm very worried about it,"" Powell said Thursday. ""From the Fed's standpoint, we're really looking at a business cycle length: that's our frame of reference. The long-run fiscal, nonsustainability of the U.S. federal government isn't really something that plays into the medium term that is relevant for our policy decisions.""
""It's a long-run issue that we definitely need to face, and ultimately, will have no choice but to face,” he added.
Total U.S. debt is about $21.9 trillion, of which $16 trillion is owed by the public, according to CNBC."
1232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>",Xiaomi CEO Looks Past Selloff to 5G-Led China Phone Revival,"(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp.’s billionaire co-founder, shrugging off a share slump that wiped $6 billion off its market value in just three days, expects the advent of next-generation wireless to energize demand for its smartphones.
The Chinese devices maker is now focusing on pushing upmarket while expanding into Europe, forgoing the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun told Bloomberg Television. He didn’t outline his reasons for avoiding the world’s largest economy, once deemed a promising arena for Xiaomi but now increasingly hostile to Chinese corporations.
On Thursday, Xiaomi announced plans to give its bargain “Redmi” label more prominence so it can begin to raise prices and specs on its flagship Mi gadgets. That effort to elevate its name comes as the smartphone boom plateaus and China’s economy decelerates. But rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. have already claimed a share of the higher end of the market, encroaching on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s turf.
While Lei declined to comment on how an economic deceleration might affect his business, he did say 5G will revive not just demand for smartphones, but also the internet services Xiaomi hosts. They now run the gamut from online music to movies and serve, collectively, some 220 million users.
“In China, the penetration rate of smartphones is extremely high,” Lei said in an interview. “But I think we are at the eve of 5G. I believe when 5G phones start to get popular, the overall demand from China will recover.”
Xiaomi shares rose 2.1 percent to HK$10.18 as of 11:21 a.m. in Hong Kong. The stock is 40 percent below the price in July’s initial public offering and shed 17 percent in the past three days after a post-IPO lockup on billions of shares was lifted. Several analysts cut their price targets or estimates on the former high-flier this week. Once touted as an internet company that can command a value of as much as $100 billion, Xiaomi is now worth roughly a third of that.
In the wake of Apple’s shock outlook-cut last week, CLSA slashed its forecast on Xiaomi’s shipments by 15 percent to 135 million units this year -- lagging Huawei but ahead of local rivals including like Oppo.
To be sure, it’s come a long way since its inception. Shareholders who’ve owned a piece of the company since its first funding rounds can pocket a fat profit. Some 3.9 billion shares bought in a round of funding that started in 2010 cost less than two Hong Kong cents each, according to the company’s prospectus.
“Over the past two to three years, we have entered about 80 countries and regions,” Lei told reporters at an earlier roundtable. “I hope the momentum continues.”

Nissan confirmed it had sent Ghosn's Japan-based legal team a termination notice on his residence in Azabu, one of Tokyo's priciest neighborhoods, on Monday, the latest step in ending its relationship with Ghosn, who is facing financial misconduct charges in Japan.
In the wake of Ghosn's arrest, the automaker is also planning to terminate other agreements under which it had been providing residences to Ghosn, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters, including the lease agreement on an apartment in Amsterdam.
In addition, it is no longer making payments on his residence in Paris, the person added on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Nissan was not immediately available to comment on the additional residences.
As chairman of Nissan,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), the globe-trotting Ghosn had access to a string of residences around the world, including additional homes in Beirut and Rio de Janeiro. 

Tokyo prosecutors are expected on Friday to indict Ghosn on two new financial misconduct charges, adding to his legal challenges. Ghosn has denied all of the allegations against him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - William Barr, nominated by President Donald Trump to become U.S. attorney general, plans to recuse himself from a major antitrust case, according to people who spoke with him on Thursday, as he navigates possible conflicts of interest presented by about $37 million in assets he amassed as a private-sector lawyer.
Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate.
Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&T last year, from 2009 until 2018. 
The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision.
Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said.
""He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,"" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr.
She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend.
A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter.
Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys.
According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate.
As of Dec. 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy Inc stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well.
Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. 
Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. 
Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc and drugmakers Merck & Co Inc and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan.
Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. 
In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management (CBS.UL).

Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) raised U.S. prices on around two dozen prescription drugs on Thursday, including the psoriasis treatment Stelara, prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood thinner Xarelto, all among its top-selling products.
J&J joined many other companies that raised U.S. prices on hundreds of prescription medicines earlier this month.
Most of the J&J increases were between 6 percent and 7 percent, according to data from Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines.
The increases came on the same day that Democratic members of Congress introduced proposed legislation aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs for American consumers.
J&J said the average list price increase on its drugs will be 4.2 percent this year. However, it expects the net price it actually receives for its medicines to drop. That is because drugmakers negotiate rebates and discounts off the list price with payers in order to ensure patient access to their products.
The company does not plan to raise prices on any more drugs this year, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said. 
Drugmakers kicked off 2019 with U.S. price increases on more than 250 prescription medicines by Jan. 2. That total has almost doubled, with pharmaceutical companies hiking prices on nearly 490 drugs by Jan. 10, according to Rx Savings.
This includes insulin price hikes of between 4.4 percent and 5.2 percent by Sanofi (PA:SASY) and 4.9 percent by  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb).
Sanofi said its increases were below the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services projections for medical inflation, and that it expects net prices to drop in 2019. Novo Nordisk said its raised list prices help offset increases in rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.
With pressure from lawmakers and the administration of President Donald Trump intensifying, the pace of drug increases has been slower than last year, when drugmakers raised prices on around 650 drugs over the first 10 days of 2018. 
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed policy changes aimed at lowering drug prices and passing on more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers to patients. Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short-term, however, and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cadillac is expected to become General Motors Co's (N:GM) lead electric vehicle brand as the largest U.S. automaker gears up to introduce a new model under that luxury marquee to challenge Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), two people briefed on the matter said Thursday.
GM is set to announce Friday as part of an investor update that a Cadillac will be the first vehicle based on its forthcoming ""BEV3"" platform, the people said. The vehicle platform is the basis for vehicle underpinnings, including the battery system and other structural and mechanical parts.
GM is not expected to disclose on Friday additional details, including precisely when the Cadillac EV will be built, whether it will be a crossover or sedan, or where it will be assembled, the sources said.
A GM spokesman declined to comment.
GM had previously focused on making electric vehicles under its mass market Chevrolet brand, including its plug-in Chevrolet Volt and battery electric Bolt. GM announced last year it was ending production of the plug-in Volt as well as a low-selling plug-in Cadillac CT6, even as it moved to boost EV spending.
GM said in November as part of its restructuring efforts it was doubling resources for electric and autonomous vehicle programs over the next two years.
Last month, two Ohio senators asked GM to commit to building all future electric vehicles for U.S. buyers within the country.
GM said in 2017 it planned by 2021 to introduce a new dedicated flexible electric vehicle architecture and an advanced battery system to support the development of at least 20 new models in the United States and China.
GM said in 2017 that a new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van.
Johan de Nysschen, who was then Cadillac's president, told Reuters at the Detroit auto show in January 2018 the luxury brand will play a ""central role"" in GM's electrification strategy, including China. He added that Cadillac would be ""at the forefront"" of rolling out new electric vehicles in the United States and China. He left GM in April.
This week, GM said Cadillac sales in China rose 17.2 percent in 2018, surpassing 200,000 units for the first time. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said that GM aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles.
Barra said in 2017 the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020. GM opened a battery plant with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) last year.

In October, GM urged the Trump administration to back a nationwide program to boost sales of zero emission vehicles like electric cars, even as the government has proposed ending California's ability to require more clean vehicles.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>","British banks' new disputes service too limited, lawmakers say","By Iain Withers and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Big British banks have been criticized by lawmakers for pressing ahead with plans for a new complaints service for small firms wronged by lenders, which they argue is too soft.
UK Finance, a City of London trade body, is setting up and funding the new service which be capable of resolving disputes and paying awards of up to 600,000 pounds ($765,600).
This initiative follows a decade of campaigning by small businesses which have complained they were mistreated by their banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The banks’ proposal has won the backing of the British government, according to correspondence between Britain's finance ministry and lawmakers published on Friday.
But two groups of British members of parliament have criticized the proposals for being too weak, arguing they would still exclude hundreds of firms from access to affordable justice.
Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the cross-party parliamentary group for fair business banking, said his group had been offered a seat on the new complaints service’s steering committee, but he planned to reject this unless his concerns were addressed.
""It’s massively important to give firms access to affordable justice and we are nowhere near that,” Hollinrake told Reuters.
“It’s nice to be invited, but unless they address these points it’s a case of thanks, but no thanks.”
Hollinrake also criticized the new dispute body’s proposed award limits and eligibility criteria, saying it should have independent governance, such as by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators
Small complaints are currently handled by the Financial Ombudsman Service, but campaigners and a number of senior lawmakers favor setting up a new tribunal system for disputes outside the Ombudsman's limited remit, with stronger powers to sanction and compel evidence from lenders.
But the government has shown little appetite for backing the legislation needed to establish such a system and has instead supported the UK Finance plans.
Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, said: “There is cross-party support to provide enhanced protections and improved access to justice for SMEs, so it’s disappointing that the government will not pursue our recommendations.""
The government rejected the Treasury Committee's call for setting up a tribunal to handle complex complaints from banking customers.
The government said the existing Ombudsman's remit was already being expanded from April to give an additional 210,000 SMEs with turnover of up to 6.5 million pounds access to its free service.
The government has backed the Financial Conduct Authority's plan to increase the Ombudsman's redress award limit to 350,000 pounds from 150,000 pounds.
""It is the government’s view that businesses with a turnover greater than 10 million pounds can reasonably be expected to be in a position to go to court,"" it said. 
UK Finance's new disputes body would cater for businesses with a turnover of between 6.5 million and 10 million pounds.

AXP is now up about 10% from its Christmas Eve close at $89.50, and the shares are on track to close a second consecutive week back above their 80-week moving average -- a long-term trendline that has historically signaled buying opportunities (see chart).

There have been 13 such signals over the past 15 years, and the stock's returns going forward are compellingly bullish— especially for a ""boring"" blue chip like AXP.
Looking out four weeks after one of these 80-week pullback signals, AXP was 3.62% higher, on average, with 77% of the returns positive. And expanding the time frame to three months after a signal, the stock's average return climbs to 6.34%, with 85% of the returns positive.
However, Wall Street seems unprepared for an extended AXP rally. Among the 18 analysts tracking the shares, only seven call them a ""strong buy,"" with 11 doling out a lukewarm ""hold"" rating. Any upgrades from this group could bring some fresh buyers to the table in the weeks ahead.
Meanwhile, short sellers have been piling on. Short interest on American Express stock rose by 15.4% in the most recent two-week reporting period, and was up by 27.1% over the past two reporting periods. The current supply of 7.86 million AXP shares sold short represents an eight-month high, and points to a healthy supply of sideline cash that could unwind to fuel short-term upside in the stock.
Options players are also bearishly skewed. During the past 50 days, speculative players on the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) have bought to open 1.45 puts for every call on AXP. This ratio arrives in the 86th percentile of its annual range, as options traders have shown a greater preference for bearish bets over bullish only 14% of the time in the past year.
With AXP set to report earnings on Jan. 17, prospective call buyers may wish to see how the post-event price action shakes out — and how low implied volatility falls before placing a trade based on this bullish buy signal. That said, given the strength of the three-month returns following prior 80-week pullbacks, it's worth pointing out that AXP’s at-the-money April options are currently pricing in just 24.8% implied volatility, which is about 14 percentage points ""cheaper"" than the stock's current 30-dayvolatility."

He's presenting at MoneyShow Orlando Feb. 9.
Amarin Corporation plc (AMRN) rose $1.12 to $15.03 Wednesday, trading 13.8 million shares, 1.5 times its average volume. The move followed a J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference presentation by the company, which markets a purified fish-oil pill. The stock took out the declining tops line and reached resistance at $15.80 before backing off. Next targets are $17 and $19.
Aphria Inc. (APHA) gained 46¢ to $6.79 on 7.2 million shares Wednesday. The cannabis stock got as high as $6.90, an important resistance from its gap down in early December. A move to fill that gap would suggest a rally to our next target of $7.75.
Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC) jumped $3.96 to $33.60 on nearly 17 million shares, its largest volume day in two months, after positive remarks from stock analysts. The stock, like some others in the marijuana group, has broken out of its falling wedge and is starting to emerge. A break of resistance at $36 to $36.50, would suggest a move to the mid-$40-level.
Veracyte, Inc. (VCYT) gained 66¢ to $15.20 on lighter volume of 235,200 shares. The biotech company announced it is scheduled to present at the Needham Growth Conference Tuesday, Jan. 15. The stock has advanced five days in a row, breaking out of a 10-week declining channel and now testing the November high of $15.50, getting to as high as $15.39 intraday. A break through here could take the stock towards the long-term rising channel top near $19.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 06:59PM ET</span>","Macy's cuts profit, sales forecast after weak holiday season","By Nandita Bose and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) shares plunged 18 percent on Thursday after the department store operator slashed its full-year profit and sales forecast on the back of an anemic holiday season, sending a chill through the wider retail sector. 
Macy's said its sales slowed after a good start to the holidays, and flagged particular weakness in women's sportswear, sleepwear, fashion jewelry, fashion watches and cosmetics. Its comparable sales over the critical November and December months rose 1.1 percent.
Department stores in recent quarters had shown signs they were finding ways to cope with declining mall traffic and tough competition from online seller Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). A robust economy and strong consumer spending had been expected to offer further relief. 
Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) reported similarly muted comparable sales growth for the holidays, sending its shares down as much as 9 percent.  Target  Corp (N:TGT) was down nearly 4 percent even after the retailer posted relatively strong holiday sales growth of nearly 6 percent.
Those results come as overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season hit a six-year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard (NYSE:MA) report in late December. But some are already calling for an industry-wide slowdown this year. 
""It looks like the consumer is in good shape but generally there are signs of some slowing in the economy,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics. 
Consumer confidence in 2019 is seen as likely to be strained by rising U.S. interest rates, the ongoing trade spat with China, market volatility due to concerns over global growth and political deadlock in Washington. 
A recession could hit many department stores particularly hard, some industry watchers said. 
""If we do get a recession, the retailers that can offer strong value in both physical bricks-and-mortar format, as well as a good online experience will do best,"" said Jeff Yastine, senior equities analyst at investment advisory firm Banyan Hill Publishing. 
""That leaves many department store chains, like Macy's, on the outside of this trend until they can figure out how to marry 'luxury' with the convenience of online retail that consumers want,"" he said.
FORECAST CUTS
Macy's now expects 2 percent growth in comparable sales for the full year, down from a previous outlook of 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent growth. Its comparable sales, including licensed departments, rose 1.1 percent during November and December.
The retailer is now calling for diluted earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.00 for fiscal 2018, excluding settlement charges, impairment and other costs. Its previous guidance issued in November called for EPS of $4.10 to $4.30. 
""The holiday season began strong - particularly during Black Friday and the following Cyber week, but weakened during the mid-December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas,"" Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer at Macy's, said in a statement.
The retailer has reported four consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, and its shares had risen more than 80 percent over a 12-month period heading into Thanksgiving.
Kohl's reported comparable sales growth of 1.2 percent during the final two months of 2018, down sharply from 6.9 percent a year earlier.
Target was a bright spot with comparable sales growth of 5.7 percent during November and December, up from growth of 3.4 percent in the same period last year, but its performance on Thursday was overshadowed by its rivals.
Target said its sales were helped by higher customer visits and strong online sales during the holiday season, as well as strength in with toys, baby and seasonal gifts. It expects same-store sales growth of about 5 percent for the fourth quarter through January.
Target reaffirmed its full-year earnings and sales forecast, putting it on track for its fastest full-year comparable sales growth since 2005.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>",U.S.-based stock funds draw $8.74 billion in latest week: Lipper,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors put money to work in both U.S. stock and bond markets for the week ended Wednesday, after soothing remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that low inflation would allow the U.S. central bank to be ""patient"" in deciding whether to continue raising rates this year.
U.S.-based stock funds attracted about $8.74 billion in the week ended Jan. 9, following the previous week's cash withdrawal of $18.7 billion, according to data released Thursday by Lipper. U.S.-based taxable bond funds attracted $8.4 billion in the week ended Wednesday, following the previous week's cash outflows of over $12.7 billion, according to Refinitiv's Lipper research service.
""It appeared to be 'risk-on' for the week,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Lipper. He noted that it was the first week in 29 that equity mutual funds - excluding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - witnessed net inflows of over $4.4 billion. That marked their largest weekly net inflows since June 20, 2018, he said. 
But Roseen said it was the seventh consecutive week that taxable bond funds, excluding ETFs, witnessed net outflows, handing back $926 million this past week. Taxable bond ETFs, for their part, attracted roughly $9.35 billion for the same time period, Lipper data show. 
""Domestic equity funds - ex-ETFs - took in a little less than $3.3 billion, witnessing their second weekly net inflows in three while posting a 3.99 percent return on average for the flows week,"" Roseen said. 
Their non-domestic equity fund counterparts, posting a 4.08 percent return on average, witnessed their first weekly net inflows since Sept. 19, 2018, said Roseen, noting more than $1.1 billion of inflows this past week.
For the 15th week in a row, non-domestic equity ETFs witnessed net inflows, with this past week attracting $3.6 billion, Roseen said. That was their largest weekly net inflows since Jan. 31, 2018, he said.

All told, safer money-market funds attracted over $17 billion in the week ended Wednesday, underscoring investors' skittishness on financial markets given the recent volatility. It was the sector's fifth consecutive week of cash inflows, Lipper said.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is boosting its bonus pool by 3 percent for 2018 after its investment banking division topped charts throughout the year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
Bankers, traders and other employees will find out how much they were awarded on an individual basis next week, said one of the people. They shared information on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss bonuses.
JPMorgan employees who can look forward to bonus payments likely include those in the equities trading division. Equity markets revenue was up 17 percent in third quarter of 2018 over the prior year. 
JPMorgan reports fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. 
JPMorgan is known as one of the stingier banks on Wall Street in terms of how much it pays revenue-generating employees. 
In 2017, the largest U.S. bank spent $7.5 billion on total compensation, which includes bonuses as well as salaries and other employee-related expenses, like health benefits. That represented 31 percent of overall revenue. 

In its investment bank, that amount was $2 billion last year, representing a compensation ratio of 27 percent. At Wall Street rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), that figure was 37 percent.

Moody's, which cut PG&E's rating to B2 from Baa3, said access to capital has become more uncertain for the company.
The downgrade followed a Reuters report on Friday, citing sources, that the utility company was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection.
Moody's also downgraded its ratings of PG&E unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co to Ba3 from Baa2.
""The company (PG&E) is increasingly reliant on extraordinary intervention by legislators and regulators, which may not occur soon enough or be of sufficient magnitude to address these adverse developments,"" Jeff Cassella, Moody's vice president-senior credit officer, said in a statement.
S&P cut the rating on PG&E and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit on Monday to ""B"" from ""BBB-,"" the lowest tier of so-called investment-grade ratings.
The wildfire, which killed at least 86 people, broke out on the morning of Nov. 8 near the mountain community of Paradise. It is said to be one of the most destructive wildfires in California's history.

Moody's said it would continue to look for signs of legislative and regulatory support for PG&E, as the company works through various investigative, legal and regulatory processes.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>","Mexicans embrace bikes, scooters as fuel shortage drags on","By Julia Love and Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans faced with a fuel shortage are turning to bikes and scooters, generating business for startups that rent those alternative rides, but straining operations for ride-hailing service Uber in some cities. 
The shortages came after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador closed some vulnerable pipelines in a crackdown on fuel theft. There have been long lines at pumping stations this week in several states.
Uber said the fuel shortage posed challenges in some cities in the central state of Guanajuato and the Western state of Michoacan. Users are requesting fewer trips in those cities, but with fewer Uber drivers on the road, demand has increased for those who are working, said company spokesman Saul Crespo.
""Although the temporary closure of some gas stations can affect the demand for available vehicles, we are working to make sure our driving partners do not see their profits affected,"" Crespo said in a statement, adding Uber will take steps to hold prices steady. 
Spanish ride-hailing company Cabify said its operations had also been affected, while Chinese firm Didi Chuxing said it had not been impacted.
For startups peddling bikes and scooters, the crisis touched off a flurry of new business. 
Mobility as a Service for Latin America, a trade group representing firms such as Chinese bike-sharing company Mobike and California scooter outfit Bird, reported a spike in demand as people who normally drive scramble for alternatives. 
""It's a big opportunity for those companies to show that new alternatives can be substitutes for traditional cars, for short distances,"" said Miguel Abad, who leads public affairs for the group.
Mobike, which entered Mexico with its fleet of bright orange bikes last year, said its trips jumped an additional 10 percent above normal growth over the past few days. 
Jetty, a Mexico City-based van-sharing service, has seen a 10 percent rise in demand and expects the trend to intensify in the coming days, said Chief Executive Cristina Palacios. Starting on Monday, the company will temporarily boost service on its main routes, she added.
""There's still this risk that we might not have enough gas to meet our demand,"" she said. ""But up until now we haven't had any problems.” 
For Grin, a Mexico City-based scooter company, demand had more than doubled and was climbing further on Thursday, co-founder Sergio Romo wrote in an e-mail.
""Don't worry, Grin is electric,"" the company advised users on Twitter.
But drivers for ride-hailing services have faced the same headaches finding fuel as any others. 
In Mexico City, pumping stations were swamped with drivers making panic purchases, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador.
Cabify said in a statement that its drivers had been hit by the fuel shortage, asking customers to be patient.
Luis Garcia, who drives for Uber in Mexico City and owns cars driven by others on the platform, said he had struggled to fill up.
""There's been an impact on profits,"" said Garcia, 27. ""You're spending money to find a gas station."" 
Armando Silva, a 34-year-old who works in Mexico City's posh Polanco neighborhood, said he normally takes public transportation to the office. But with routes packed, he experimented with a new commute on Thursday.

""Today I tried a scooter, and it went well,"" he said. ""But I hope they resolve the shortage because it's more expensive and a little far to make the trip like this.""

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Brazil government approves Boeing-Embraer tie-up,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government on Thursday said it would allow a proposed tie-up between planemakers Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to go forward, capping weeks of uncertainty in which President Jair Bolsonaro expressed his hesitation.
The deal still must be approved by shareholders and regulators, but winning the backing of Brazil's government was its biggest hurdle.
Under the proposed deal, Embraer will sell 80 percent of its commercial plane division, its most profitable, for $4.2 billion. The deal is seen as part of a reshaping of the global aviation market for mid-sized planes. It follows a similar deal by Boeing's rival Airbus (PA:AIR) which bought Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) commercial plane division that competed with Embraer. 
Embraer's private shareholders now must vote to approve or reject the deal within 30 days.
Shortly after assuming the presidency on Jan. 1, Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had expressed concern that Boeing might end up owning all of Embraer if the deal was approved under the terms proposed. 

But on Thursday, a statement from his office said his government had analyzed the proposal and found that it ""preserves (Brazil's) sovereignty and the national interests.""

1247,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 04:38PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Core CPI Expected to Rise
Retail inflation numbers will be the focus of the economic calendar before the bell tomorrow.
The Labor Department will issue the December consumer price index (CPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the CPI fell 0.1% last month. But the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% in December.
On an annual basis the core CPI is expected to post a rise of 2.2%, slightly above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
Fed speakers, especially chief Jay Powell, have been having much more sway on the markets than economic indicators of late. But it’s important to note that the FOMC’s patience that Powell discussed will also make the Fed more data-dependent.
2. GM Hosts Investor Webcast
General Motors (NYSE:GM) will host a webcast for analysts and institutional investors tomorrow.
The even kicks off at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT) and is scheduled to last until 12:15 PM ET. Investors should be on the lookout for headlines from the automaker or can listen to the entire webcast here.
Today, Ford (NYSE:F) announced it would cut thousands of jobs in its turnaround plan for Europe.
GM issues its latest earnings on Feb. 6 and analysts are expecting a profit of $1.21 per share on sales of about $36 billion.
Shares of GM are down about 20% in the last year, but are up around 6% in the last three months.
3. Can Oil Muster Another Gain?
Oil prices have been on a tear, but bullish momentum slipped a little today, with WTI futures ending just slightly higher.
Still, oil is up 10% this week, on track for its best weekly gain since November 2016.
""(T)he bulls are trying to keep it together and waiting for the next big driver to emerge,"" said Gene McGillian, director of energy research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.
Barring some more comments from the Saudis to firm prices even more, attention will likely be on the Baker Hughes rig count number that arrives at 1 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
Last week the rig count stood at 877."

(Reuters) - Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a session of whipsaw trading as investors responded to mixed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, while a warning from Macy's pummeled retail stocks.
Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. But major stock indexes temporarily moved into negative territory after Powell said the bank's balance sheet would be ""substantially smaller,"" and after he raised concerns about the size of U.S. debt.
""That's what spooked the market a little bit. It's more of a commentary on the entire economy as a whole,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin.

Trade-related optimism faded somewhat as China offered little in the way of details on key issues such as forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, tariff barriers and cyber attacks.
In the United States, reports from Macy's and American Airlines added to concerns that growth of corporate profits would slow.
Macy's Inc (N:M) stock plunged 17.69 percent and pulled down other retailers after the department store operator cut its same-store sales forecast for the full year because of weak demand during mid-December.
S&P 500 companies on average are seen posting 14.5 percent growth in earnings per share as they report December-quarter results over the next few weeks, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, expectations for growth in 2019 are at 6.4 percent, down from an expectation of 7.3 percent on Jan 1.
""It could be a good quarter, but maybe with more cautious outlooks until we get something that comes out of the trade negotiations,"" said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. ""There is a lot of uncertainty there.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) climbed 0.51 percent to end at 24,001.92 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.45 percent to 2,596.63.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.42 percent to 6,986.07.
Trade-sensitive industrial stocks (SPLRCI) rose 1.44 percent, lifted by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which gained 2.55 percent after the U.S. Air Force accepted its long-delayed KC-46 air tanker.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) fell 4.13 percent after the No. 1 U.S. carrier cut its fourth-quarter profit and unit revenue forecasts. That weighed on other airline shares as well.
Ten out of 11 S&P sector indexes rose, led by a 1.55 percent increase in real estate <.SPLRCR>, with consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) ending down 0.23 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 12 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.3 billion shares, compared with the 8.9 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

1252,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Logs 5-Day Winning Streak, Shrugging off Slump in Retailers","Investing.com - Wall Street closed higher despite a slump in retailers and renewed concerns about the Federal Reserve tightening after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue to trim its balance sheet.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.51%, closing higher for a fifth-straight day. The S&P 500 gained 0.45%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.42%.
Powell said the Fed's balance sheet will be ""substantially smaller,"" indicating the central bank will press ahead with its balance sheet wind-down operation, renewing investor concerns about monetary policy tightening.
On rates, however, the Fed chairman reiterated the central bank will be ""patient,"" as it weighs the pace of global growth and domestic inflation.
Sentiment on stocks was also rocked by a slump in retailers after Macy’s (NYSE:M) revealed disappointing sales over the crucial holiday period and slashed its 2018 earnings outlook.
Macy's warned it expects no growth in net sales for the fiscal year 2018, a sharp contrast from its previous guidance for an increase in the range of 0.3% to 0.7%. Its shares slumped 18%.
Retailers  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) also slid, pushing the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF 2% lower.
A rout in airlines, meanwhile, also threatened the five-day rally in the broader market, led by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) as it cut its outlook on profit, raising fears that earnings may have peaked ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which gets underway in earnest next week.
But analysts at Cowen shrugged off the weakness in the sector on expectations that airlines will see margin expansion in 2019, driven by a ""combination of continued revenue momentum and a recent decline in fuel costs.""
Energy, meanwhile, ended the day unchanged as oil prices edged higher, but gains were held back by concerns over waning demand on signs of a continued slowdown in China, the world's largest importer of crude, and worries about U.S.-China trade.
The outlook on international trade was muddied somewhat as the White House is reportedly considering legislation that could grant President Donald Trump more unilateral power to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners' products that carry higher import taxes, Bloomberg reported.
But the draft “United States Reciprocal Trade Act”, which some within the White House would like Trump to unveil in his State of the Union address later this month, could struggle to garner enough votes in Congress, according to Bloomberg.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 03:58PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler agrees to $800 million U.S. diesel-emissions settlement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has agreed to a settlement worth about $800 million to resolve claims from the U.S. Justice Department and state of California that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests, but still faces an ongoing criminal probe.
The hefty penalty is the latest fallout from the U.S. government's stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules.
The Fiat Chrysler settlement includes $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, and extended warranties worth $105 million. It covers 104,000 Fiat Chrysler 2014-16 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels, the Justice Department said.
Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used ""defeat devices"" to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving. 
Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that ""the settlements do not change the Company’s position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests."" The company did not admit liability.
""You wouldn't pay $311 million total dollars to the federal government in civil penalties if there were not a serious problem,"" U.S. assistant attorney general Jeff Clark told a news conference.
The settlement also includes $72.5 million for state civil penalties, and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims.
German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH (ROBG.UL), which provided the emissions control software for the vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners. Owners will receive an average of $2,800 to obtain software updates as part of the emissions recall, Fiat Chrysler said.
Elizabeth Cabraser, a lawyer for the owners, said the ""substantial cash compensation"" will ensure that consumers get the recall fix. 
Bosch, which also provided diesel emissions software to Volkswagen, also agreed to pay $103.5 million to settle claims with 47 U.S. states that said the supplier ""enabled"" the cheating and should have known its customers would use the software improperly, the New York Attorney General's Office said.
Bosch said in a statement it did not accept liability or admit to the factual allegations, but that the settlement reflects ""Bosch’s desire to move forward and to spare the company the very substantial costs and the burden on the company’s resources that would be required to litigate these issues.""
The Justice Department said the settlement does not resolve an ongoing criminal investigation into Fiat Chrysler's conduct, but officials declined to discuss the status. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating.
'DON'T CHEAT' 
U.S. regulators are also investigating  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the status of the probe - and would not say if any other automakers are under scrutiny.
Daimler declined to comment Thursday but has acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In October, Daimler said operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent, blaming ""government proceedings and measures in various regions"" in referencing diesel emissions issues.
U.S. regulators said the industry was getting a tough message.
""Fiat Chrysler deceived consumers and the federal government by installing defeat devices on these vehicles that undermined important clean air protections,"" said Andrew Wheeler, acting administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""Today’s settlement sends a clear and strong signal to manufacturers and consumers alike - the Trump administration will vigorously enforce the nation’s laws designed to protect the environment and public health.""
Wheeler said the settlement message is simple to automakers: ""Don't cheat.""
The case dragged on after the Justice Department filed suit in May 2017 and the sides remained far part. At one point, the Justice Department sought $1.4 billion in civil penalties from Fiat Chrysler - or about a $1 billion more than the company ultimately paid, two people briefed on the matter said.
The Justice Department said Fiat Chrysler must work with one or more vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters that will be sold in the 47 U.S. states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high-efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. That is estimated at $50 million to $70 million, officials said.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement, ""Fiat Chrysler tried to evade these standards by installing software to cheat emissions testing. The company not only violated the law and our trust, but did so at the expense of our environment.""
U.S. Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said at a news conference that automakers were on notice: ""If you cheat our emissions tests you are going to get caught.""
Fiat Chrysler has agreed to an enhanced whistleblower program and the company must implement corporate governance, organization and technical process reforms to minimize the likelihood of future Clean Air Act violations and must hire a compliance auditor to oversee and assess the reforms.
With the Fiat Chrysler settlement, the U.S. Justice Department's total civil fines for both Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen are now valued at around $2,500 per vehicle.
In total, Volkswagen agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, including spending as much as $15 billion to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company pleaded guilty to three felony counts to resolve the criminal probe.
Fiat Chrysler shares were up 1.6 percent at $16.03 late on Thursday in New York.

The settlement will be open for public comment for 30 days before a federal judge decides whether to approve the agreements.

(Reuters) - A federal judge in Minnesota ruled this week that Dairy Queen, owned by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), may pursue its lawsuit to stop W.B. Mason Co from selling ""Blizzard"" bottled spring water, the name it uses for a popular ice cream product.
U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson rejected W.B. Mason's request to dismiss the trademark infringement case or move it to Massachusetts, where the office supplies distributor is based, because it sold no Blizzard water in Minnesota and lacked enough ties to the state.
The St. Paul-based judge wrote on Jan. 8 that a 1990 legal precedent gave her jurisdiction because W.B. Mason had registered with Minnesota authorities, despite recent Supreme Court decisions suggesting that greater ties might be needed.
Jason Kravitz, a lawyer for W.B. Mason, said on Thursday it was disappointed with the outcome and considered the 1990 precedent ""no longer good law."" He said the company will review its legal options.
Sheldon Klein, a lawyer for Dairy Queen, declined to comment. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has since 1998 owned Dairy Queen, whose full name is American Dairy Queen Corp.
Dairy Queen's Blizzard contains soft-serve ice cream that can be blended with fruit, nuts, M&Ms, Oreos and other mix-ins.
The Minneapolis-based company began using the Blizzard name in 1946, and has five Blizzard trademarks.
It claimed in its lawsuit last March 12 that the sale of Blizzard water, which began in 2010, threatened irreparable harm and customer confusion because many Dairy Queen stores also sold bottled water.
W.B. Mason sued three days later in Boston for a court order that there was no infringement. That case was later put on hold, and it is not immediately clear what will happen to it.
Known for eating habits that might give doctors heartburn, Buffett, 88, told Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance in 2016 that at Dairy Queen he usually orders a small sundae for the ice cream, an extra large sundae for the topping, and combines them.

The case is American Dairy Queen Corp v. W.B. Mason Co, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-00693.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 03:54PM ET</span>",Investors ask how the Bezos divorce will affect Amazon,"By David Randall and Jan Wolfe
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) shares seesawed on Thursday as investors questioned how the impending divorce of company founder Jeff Bezos would affect his control of the most valuable company on Wall Street and its ambitious expansion plans. 
Bezos, whom Forbes lists as the world's richest person, worth an estimated $136.2 billion, said via Twitter on Wednesday that he and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, will divorce. Amazon shares were down 0.5 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday, after gaining earlier in the session. 
The split throws into question how the couple will split their fortune, which includes an approximately 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon's roughly $811.4 billion market capitalization. Divorce laws in Washington state, where they live, hold that property acquired during a marriage is generally divided equally between spouses. 
Most analysts and fund managers are largely sanguine and say the divorce will not lead to any significant change in the company's leadership or its growth prospects. 
Prominent short-seller Doug Kass, however, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners, said he sold his stake in Amazon on news of the divorce. That was after initially buying a stake in late December and naming Amazon among his ""best ideas list.""
""Is it premature to ask what happens to Amazon when Jeff Bezos chooses to turn over the day-to-day running of the company he founded?"" he said. ""His announced divorce gives me pause for thought.""
The couple has multiple residences across the country, so there is a possibility the divorce could be filed in a state where marital property is not presumed to be divided equally. 
New York matrimonial lawyer Bernard Clair said in that case a judge would likely determine MacKenzie Bezos' share of Amazon stock based on her contribution to her husband's success, which could include helping him make important business decisions or raising their children so he could focus on work.
Any transfer of Jeff Bezos' stock would be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements. As an officer and director at the company, Bezos could be required to file an SEC Form 4 within two business days of any transfer, though former SEC lawyer Broc Romanek noted a provision of U.S. securities laws exempts share transfers made pursuant to a domestic relations order.
Even if Bezos were exempted from filing a Form 4, he would be required to update promptly the record of his Amazon holdings on file with the SEC if his position in the company changed by 1 percent or more, said D.C. securities lawyer Thomas Gorman. MacKenzie Bezos would also need to file a similar record if she received more than 5 percent of Amazon stock.
Peter Henning, a securities law professor at Wayne State University, noted that Amazon, unlike fellow tech giants  Facebook Inc . (O:FB) and  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL), does not give its founder's shares greater voting rights. If MacKenzie Bezos is given a large block of shares, she could have a big say at the company. 
Gorman agreed. ""She could wind up with some sort of control block, and get herself a directorship,"" he said. ""It depends on what she wants to do.”
Any effort to dilute MacKenzie Bezos' voting rights by creating a separate class of shares would require a shareholder vote, said Gorman, though he added that he thought such a move unlikely.
“Nobody wants to run their divorce through a shareholder meeting,” he said. 
Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta fund, said that while he is not changing his investment in Amazon, he expects other growth-focused portfolio managers may trim their stakes due to concerns about the divorce's impact. 
""This is such an over-owned company and this gives them an excuse to say 'Maybe I'll trim some back because it adds a new question mark',"" he said. 
Bacarella, however, said he is not concerned because even if MacKenzie Bezos liquidated a stake that could be as high as 8 percent, there would be no fundamental reason behind the sale. Any impact would be short-term in nature. 
""Unless you worry that he will get so distracted by the divorce that he cannot manage the company, this will be a non-event,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""He is given control of the company because shareholders like him and his vision, not because he has 50 percent of the stock.""
Thomas Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said questions about the future of the company due to the divorce are legitimate due to Jeff Bezos' outsized influence on its value. Should he leave the company for any reason, its shares would likely immediately fall more than 10 percent, he said.

“His influence on the company is as a significant as if he had super-voting shares because of his track record and the way he runs the company as if he owned the whole thing,"" he said.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 02:39PM ET</span>",Sears chairman confirms new $5 billion bid to save bankrupt retailer,"By Jessica DiNapoli, Mike Spector and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) Chairman Eddie Lampert confirmed on Thursday he has made a new takeover bid of more than $5 billion for the company, an offer that may significantly increase the likelihood the U.S. department store will be able to stay in business. 
Lampert's revised offer, whose details were first reported by Reuters on Wednesday, will be assessed by Sears during a Jan. 14 bankruptcy auction. The company will consider whether the bid offers more value to creditors than a liquidation.
""We believe our proposal will provide substantially more value to stakeholders than any other option, in particular a liquidation,"" a spokesperson for Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, said in a prepared statement. 
""(The proposal) is the best path forward for Sears, its associates and the many communities across the United States touched by Sears and Kmart stores,"" the statement added. Sears also operates the Kmart discount chain.
Lampert's previous bid, which fell short of Sears' expectations, was valued at $4.4 billion. His new bid, made through an affiliate of ESL and disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, assumes more than $600 million in additional liabilities, including taxes, vendor bills and other expenses Sears has incurred since filing for bankruptcy protection last October. That is on top of about $1.1 billion in liabilities Lampert, Sears' biggest shareholder and creditor, previously agreed to assume.
""He has increased his bid substantially, but it's hard to know how much more cash is in the mix,"" said Todd Feinsmith, co-chairman of law firm Pepper Hamilton LLP's bankruptcy practice. ""I think it indicates he's very serious."" 
Determining if Lampert will prevail in buying the company without seeing any other bids that may come in for Sears, Feinsmith added, is hard to do. At the auction on Jan. 14, his offer will be compared with how much Sears would bring if sold off in pieces. 
A group of Sears creditors, including some landlords and vendors, has been calling for the chain to shut its doors for good, saying they will recover more money in that scenario. They also say that suing Lampert over past deals he has done with the company will help boost how much they recoup. 
Lampert has maintained that those previous transactions were proper. As part of his new bid, he has asked to be freed from having to face lawsuits over his past deals with Sears. For that right, a so-called ""legal release,"" Lampert is offering $35 million in cash, according to the regulatory filing. 
Those creditors have also opposed Lampert's proposal to forgive the $1.3 billion of Sears debt he holds and use it as currency for his offer, a bankruptcy move called a ""credit bid."" Sears this week allowed his bid to move forward without U.S. bankruptcy judge in its case, Robert Drain, addressing whether the move is valid, but the judge will ultimately have to weigh in. 
SAVING JOBS
Lampert's bid would preserve up to 50,000 jobs. Sears employed about 68,000 people when it filed for bankruptcy in October. As part of his previous bid, Lampert planned to acquire 425 stores that are still open.
The new offer takes on roughly $166 million in payment obligations to vendors and $43 million in additional severance costs. The hedge fund will also assume $135 million in tax bills for properties that Lampert hopes to acquire as part of his bid. 
To finance the new offer, ESL has received debt commitment letters from lenders for a new asset-backed loan. 
ESL and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners LP, which was a creditor of Sears before its bankruptcy, will also provide debt financing, including a new real estate loan, according to the filing.
Sears had set a Jan. 9 deadline for Lampert to submit a new offer for the retailer and a $120 million deposit. The chain had decided to ask Drain to pursue liquidation on the morning of Jan. 8, before giving Lampert more time to improve his offer.

The ruling came after a regional consumer protection watchdog brought a case against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), arguing that the Dash buttons violate laws that say shoppers should know what they are paying at the time of any transaction.
""We are always open to innovation. But if innovation means that the consumer is put at a disadvantage and price comparisons are made difficult then we fight that,"" Wolfgang Schuldzinski, head of the consumer body, said in a statement.
The online retailer launched its thumb-sized Dash button in 2015, allowing members of its Prime membership scheme to re-order products such as laundry detergent, coffee and dishwasher tablets by pushing a wifi-connected button.
An Amazon spokesman said the company was convinced the Dash button complied with German law and it would fight the ruling through other legal channels, even though the consumer body said the court would not grant an appeal.
""Today's ruling is not only hostile to innovation. It also stops customers from making an informed decision about whether a service like the Dash button gives them a convenient shopping experience,"" he said.
Separately, Amazon is under investigation by Germany's anti-trust authority, which is looking into whether the company is exploiting its market dominance in its relations with third-party retailers who use its website as a marketplace.

Germany is Amazon's second biggest market. It has faced a long-running battle with unions in the country over pay and conditions for logistics workers.

PARIS/YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - One of  Renault  (PA:RENA) boss Carlos Ghosn's senior executives received an additional six-figure salary unknown to the carmaker's board via the Dutch joint venture overseeing its alliance with Nissan (T:7201), according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.
Ghosn and Nissan senior director Greg Kelly, who are at the center of a financial misconduct scandal engulfing the carmaking alliance, approved payments totaling 500,000 euros ($572,000) to Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who is responsible for corporate governance in her role as board secretary.
There is nothing to suggest that the payments by Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) were illegal or violated Renault-Nissan rules, but they highlight governance issues and potential conflicts of interest.
Renault declined to comment directly on Sepehri's RNBV pay as a board member of the Dutch holding company, which has not previously been reported. Sepehri did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
""Individual compensation, while entirely justified, is not publicly disclosed, in accordance with the law,"" a Renault spokesman said in an emailed statement. ""Renault would be outraged by any publication of an identified executive's pay, which constitutes personal information.""
Sepehri currently sits on the RNBV board with nine other Renault and Nissan executives, and is the only director who drew a compensation package directly from the subsidiary, according to the documents and a senior alliance executive.
She received 200,000 euros in 2013 and 100,000 euros annually from 2014-16 in addition to her Renault pay, according to statements addressed to her each year and the minutes of a 2013 meeting at which Ghosn and Kelly ordered the payments ""for the performance of her duties as a management board member"".
""It's important as a general rule that board secretaries avoid allowing themselves to be influenced by a CEO who might promise them remuneration through a subsidiary,"" said Loic Dessaint, head of Proxinvest, a prominent shareholder advisory firm based in Paris.
""If Ms Sepehri has been paid by RNBV, it is a conflict of interest situation,"" Dessaint said. ""At a minimum, Renault directors should have known about it.""
Ghosn and Kelly have been charged in Japan with failing to disclose $43 million in additional compensation for 2010-15 that Ghosn had arranged to be paid later. They deny that the deferred compensation agreements were illegal or required disclosure.
UNDISCLOSED PAY
The finances of RNBV and other alliance subsidiaries are under scrutiny in the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn's November arrest and ouster as the Japanese carmaker's chairman.
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, has also demanded that the carmaker provide information about RNBV payments to its executives.
Sepehri is among a small group of alliance executives who have previously attempted to find legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters reported on Dec. 19.
In 2010, she and Kelly worked on proposals to create an additional source of CEO compensation through RNBV, but later dropped the plan after concluding it would not avoid French legal disclosure requirements.
She and a handful of top managers were also involved in a 2017 project to pay out millions of euros in undisclosed bonuses via a new Dutch service company. The plan, of which Ghosn was the main beneficiary, was scrapped after Reuters revealed https://reut.rs/2R5zQ1j its existence in June of the same year.
Both efforts, which Renault has confirmed, were designed explicitly to keep the company's board and shareholders in the dark about significant compensation to the CEO, while working within the law and Renault-Nissan rules.
The scandal surrounding Ghosn and Kelly has strained Nissan's ties with 43.4 percent-owner Renault - which has maintained Ghosn as chairman and CEO, with his deputy Thierry Bollore as an interim stand-in.
Members of the Renault board, which includes French state representatives, say they have yet to be given full access to Nissan investigation findings shared with company lawyers reporting to Sepehri.
Her role gives her control over communications, legal and public affairs, as well as the flow of information to the board.
The access restrictions are required for judicial confidentiality, Renault said. The carmaker dismissed questions about a potential conflict of interest for Sepehri.
""Ms Sepehri occupies a typical general secretary function,"" Renault said, adding that the company was ""relying on the opinion of its lawyers and advisors"" in dealing with the Nissan investigation findings.
Three years after joining the French carmaker as deputy legal director, Sepehri helped negotiate the 1999 acquisition of near-bankrupt Nissan, where Ghosn - then Renault's second-in-command - led the lightning turnaround that made his name.
As their alliance deepened, Renault-Nissan BV was founded in 2002 as a jointly funded management organization.
GOVERNMENT PRESSURE
France's left-wing CGT union, which has a seat on Renault's board, said recently it had contacted Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to denounce RNBV's ""opaque workings"", citing payments to an executive it did not identify.
In response, the government demanded details of any undisclosed executive payments by the Dutch holding, in a Jan. 4 letter to Renault.
""I want to know who these payments were made to, whether they were disclosed, whether they correspond to work carried out and whether the Renault board and shareholders were informed about them,"" Le Maire said on CNews television.
Ghosn and Kelly agreed on March 26, 2013 that RNBV would pay Sepehri 125,000 euros immediately, and monthly payments thereafter amounting to 100,000 euros per year, according to the minutes of their decision.
    The two men were meeting as the RNBV board's ""governance, appointments and remuneration committee"". Its third member, Sepehri, had recused herself, the same document notes.
Four annual statements issued by RNBV confirm the subsequent payments, with a Dutch withholding tax deducted. While all RNBV directors were salaried Renault or Nissan managers, Sepehri was alone in receiving additional compensation for her board role.
In its response to Reuters, Renault said RNBV's board of directors - who also include Ghosn, Bollore and Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa - was informed about members' compensation.
""The RNBV management report, which is approved by the board and auditors, includes information about its executives' pay,"" the company said.
However, Sepehri's fellow directors of unlisted RNBV were not told who received the 100,000 euros mentioned only as compensation to ""board members"", according to a senior alliance executive who has seen the annual reports. He spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""There was no official board decision on this compensation,"" he said. Other alliance executives and RNBV directors declined to comment when approached by Reuters.
For Proxinvest, which advises large financial investors on how to vote at shareholder meetings, the RNBV board process also raises concerns.
""Good governance requires that a committee proposal should be approved by the full board,"" CEO Dessaint said. ""And the fact you have only one member receiving payment is very troubling.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian telecoms carrier Oi SA (SA:OIBR4) has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to sell noncore assets such as cellphone towers and data centers, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The company aims to raise between 1.5 billion reais and 2 billion reais ($404 million-$545 million) from the divestitures, the sources added, asking for anonymity because they cannot discuss the plans publicly.
Oi and Bank of America had no immediate comment on the matter.
Preferred shares in Oi, flat before the Reuters report, rose 1.4 percent to 1.46 reais. The benchmark Bovespa index was down 0.25 percent.
Oi filed for bankruptcy 2-1/2 years ago to restructure 65 billion reais in debt.
Before filing for what was Latin America's largest ever bankruptcy proceeding, Oi had raised around 3 billion reais by selling more than 3,600 cellular towers to the Brazilian unit of  SBA Communications Corp  (O:SBAC) in transactions closed in 2013 and 2014. 
The company plans to make investments aimed at improving its mobile and broadband operations and boosting its market share at the same time as it pursues the asset sales. 
The distressed asset managers that are Oi's top shareholders plan to focus on improving the company's mobile and broadband operations rather than a near-term sale of their stakes, Reuters reported last year.
Investment firms Solus Alternative Asset Management LP, GoldenTree Asset Management LP and York Capital Management Global Advisors LLC last year became Oi's largest shareholders after converting their debt in the company into equity stakes as part of its restructuring.
Oi has forecast capital expenditures of 7 billion reais a year over the next three years.

The debate over Theresa May’s Brexit deal is careening toward a dramatic conclusion ahead of the scheduled Parliamentary vote on Tuesday.
In the latest act in Brexit’s Shakespearian tragedy, Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn has stepped up calls for a general election ""at the earliest opportunity"" to ""break the deadlock"" over Brexit. Reading between the lines, Corbyn appears set to call for a no confidence motion in the government if May’s bill is defeated next week, as widely expected. Yesterday, UK MPs voted to decrease the window for May to come up with an alternative plan from 21 days to just three days, meaning the whole situation could come to a head in less than two weeks’ time.
For those not intimately familiar with UK politics, a majority vote of no confidence would give the government 14 days to try to win another confidence vote, and in failing that, would lead quickly to a new general election as this handy graphic from the BBC shows:
Source: BBC
For now, Corbyn is focusing on the potential for another election, though many in the Labor party are arguing for a second referendum, which could further muddy the waters and cast a pall of uncertainty over the pound moving forward.
Speaking of sterling, the UK’s currency is holding up relatively well amidst the latest drama. The British pound (GBP/USD) has recovered off last week’s mini-flash-crash lows and just yesterday saw its highest close in over month. That said, the longer-term trend continues to point lower, and it will be difficult for the currency to rally meaningfully as long as the cloud of Brexit uncertainty hangs over the whole situation. Swing traders will likely be looking to sell any rallies while keeping a close eye on fundamental developments.

The longer this rally continues, the more people are going to be fooled that happy days are here again,” says Jeff Greenblatt, Director, Lucas Wave International, LLC
In recent weeks we’ve been watching the intermediate- to long-term oil chart respond to square out vibrations over the past three years. A move of $50.85 higher from the February 2016 low to the November 2018 high followed by the recent implosion and possible low measures150 weeks (see chart). Finally, on Wednesday it broke through, violating a bunch of other relationships that could have caused at least a consolidation or shake out of the weak hands.
Source: TradingView and Forex.com
Are any other charts responding to at least intermediate term square out vibrations? There are. Let’s look at the Aussie dollar, which often moves against the greenback (see chart below). This time the U.S. Dollar has done well enough on its own to roll over, but it could get more wind at its back with the Aussie dollar changing direction. Thus far, it looks great. At 155 weeks to the 2016 low, the high on the weekly continuation is .8156, and on a square of 9 the reading is 13.855dg down.
The long bond is also starting to work on the weekly time frame as well. If bond prices continue to sink, it will help the stock market immensely on a rotation out of bonds. Let’s talk about these vibrational square outs. It was about 100 years ago Gann stated when price and time square out, the pattern changes direction. That could be anywhere from successful scalping on a one-minute E-mini chart or the calculations for the long-term top in the stock market which I showed you back in October. This is what drives the bus as far as financial markets are concerned. Why hasn’t this methodology taken off over the years?
Traders fail for a lack of knowledge. The prevailing wisdom in the Gann community is such that a stock at 30 could go to 60 in 30 days, weeks or months. This hypothesis works, to a degree. In years past I found a handful of these types of moves in a month. For instance, back in 2010 the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (BKX) peaked at 58.81 in 59 weeks. Here’s a picture of that action (see chart below).
Additionally, the high at 58.81 has a square root of 7.66. The vibration also works as the bottom was 17.76
At the time I didn’t think it was a methodology that was relevant in the 21st century. Then about four years ago I stumbled into these vibrations in a much bigger way. Not only does price and time square out, but price and/or time squares out with retracements. Price and/or time will also square out with the Gann square of 9 calculations.
It just depends how creative you allow yourself to be. In recent posts I’ve shown you how these vibrational square outs work on an intraday chart. The recent oil example and now the Aussie dollar show how this can be applied to the larger degree trend. At the New York Traders Expo in March, I will go into great detail about how this works. I call it Kairos because it represents the most opportune moment when you have the greatest edge against the person on the other side of your trade.
Since the NYSE Arca Oil Index (XOI) found the low thanks to help from the commodity itself, it has helped the stock market rebound from one of the worst Santa seasons not only in recent memory but stock market history. Until the market decided to rally the day after Christmas, many stated the market was on a path to the worst December since 1931. Yes, it did find the low but the concern going forward is the market has bottomed during the low volume holiday season.
Traders who follow sentiment/psychology are always looking for the fear to go off the charts in order to find the bottom. We haven’t seen that yet. But what seems to have happened is the crowd got alarmed to see how poor the market performed on Christmas Eve which was a low trading volume half day session. For that reason, I believe the low is vulnerable. The rally may even be vulnerable right here. Wednesday is the 89th trading day to the top in the NASDAQ back on August 30. True, this is not an absolute high or low but the Fibonacci 89-day window can still exert influence on the pattern.
What should happen going forward?
This is a bear market rally. To give you an idea, after the 9/11 bottom back in 2001 the market followed through on a six-month rally. But consider from March 2000 the bear had aged 18 months by that point. Using the NASDAQ as a guide, the current bear market— thus far— from high to low is 79 trading days. If this rally hits 38% in terms of time, it should last around 30 trading days. The NASDAQ is only at 10 trading days right now. It may need some serious upper testing before the next leg down commences.
How can I be so sure there will be another leg down? I’ve spent the past year tying all of the crazy domestic and international politics to the markets. This is a market that most closely resembles the late 1930s. The retest of the Great Depression low didn’t materialize until 1942, which meant it was a three-year bear market. I’m not saying this bear is going to last three years. 
Here is what I am saying.
Several years ago, I saw a Time magazine article from the first half of 1942 that stated German military production had peaked while America was only about 20-25% of its capacity. The German’s capability to wage war had peaked while we were just getting warmed up. The 1942 bottom materialized around the same time.
Is there anyone reading this who believes the insanity in the 24/7 news cycle is peaking right now? Your answer to that question should determine whether you believe the bear has run its course. Recently I’ve discussed The Fourth Turning, a book by William Strauss and Neil Howe. This is not a book about stock market cycles but the authors have done a masterful job of identifying the generational turns that last around 80 years. Recently I saw an old CSPAN interview from back in the late 1990s where the authors basically predicted what we are going through right now. This cycle is unlike any other we’ve seen as investors or traders. That’s a safe assumption since its not likely you were trading the market during World War II.
Is the bear market over? Not by a long shot, but then again markets don’t go straight up or down. The longer this rally continues, the more people are going to be"

All eyes will be on Fed Chair Powell, writes Bill Baruch Thursday.
Bill Baruch’s FX Rundown short video for Jan. 9-10 here.
Three Fed voting members spoke Wednesday and we got the Minutes from the Dec. meeting. But guess what? The week is just getting started. Trading levels for Dollar Index, euro, yen, Aussie and Canadian.
E-mini S&P (March)
Wednesday’s close: Settled at 2582.50, up 10.00.
Fundamentals: U.S. benchmarks began trading lower Wednesday night and have stayed under pressure heading into the morning. Right here Wednesday, with the S&P (SPX) trading at 2575 we said it is within 1% of its exhaustion point. Wednesday’s high was 2596.75 and another official Federal Reserve release is arguably a catalyst in selling. The Fed’s Minutes showed a divided committee but one where all essentially agreed on a wait and see approach after hiking in December. This aligns with the less-hawkish and even dovish (Bullard) rhetoric from officials who have spoken this week.
A larger catalyst in this weakness was U.S. and China trade talks and their lack of substance. All week, we have been pounding the table that there must be substance and details on key issues coming out of these talks; we got nothing.
Adding pressure to the tape Wednesday night was a miss across the board on Chinese inflation reads. Today, we look to weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Richmond Fed Chair Barkin speaks. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Powell at noon EDT. Arguably the most dovish member and 2019 voter St. Louis Fed President Bullard is up at 12:40 pm EDT. Chicago Fed President Evans, also a voter in 2019, speaks at 1 pm EDT and later this evening Vice Chair Clarida speaks at 5:30 pm EDT.
Technicals: The bullish tape is tired, we spoke of this here Wednesday as price action neared our major three-star resistance and sell target at...
Crude Oil (February)
Wednesday’s close: Settled at 52.36, up 2.58.
Fundamentals: Crude posted its largest gain Wednesday since reversing off the lows the day after Christmas. Reports that U.S. and China trade talks included groundwork on energy provided a tailwind for this repositioning run. Saudi Arabia has also been able to reinvigorate price action with publicly stating their desire to achieve $80.
While they have already begun to slash exports, comments from their energy minister Wednesday pointed to more action potentially coming from OPEC. This jawboning swallowed another bearish EIA inventory report, but domestic inventories remain the elephant in the room.
We have said for weeks we don’t believe Crude can hold above $50 without a shift to drawing down a bloated storage. Data Wednesday not only showed a smaller draw of Crude than expected at -1.68 mb but a massive build of 18.87 mb for the products. Additionally, inventories were added at Cushing for the 15th week in 17. This is not conducive for higher prices unless we continue to get fresh jawboning from OPEC or bullish data from them.
Technicals: Crude traded to a high of 52.58 but is consolidating lower and testing support at... 
Gold (February)
Wednesday’s close: Settled at 1292, up 6.1.
Fundamentals: Gold traded to a high of 1298 overnight. The Fed Minutes were supportive to the metal while holding pressure on the U.S. dollar (USD), however, they did not send the Dollar Index (DXY) any lower than it essentially already was prior. A whiff on Chinese CPI and PPI and weakness in equity markets overnight supported the metal but the psychological $1300 mark continues to be a barrier.
Weekly Jobless Claims were better than expected this morning and we now look to a deluge of Fed speak. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Powell. There is a 30-year auction at 1 pm EDT. Traders do want to be cautious that this newfound Fed rhetoric is running out of steam, especially as it gets put to the test with U.S. CPI tomorrow; remember, capitalize on strength but we do expect Gold to remain in a longer-term uptrend.

News websites El Confidencial and Moncloa.com reported on Wednesday that Spain's second-biggest bank had hired Jose Manuel Villarejo's firm, Grupo Cenyt, to investigate officials of construction company Sacyr (MC:SCYR) as part of efforts to stop a takeover bid by the company. 
The media reports did not say how many Sacyr officials were investigated but said BBVA also hired Grupo Cenyt to investigate Miguel Sebastian, then chief economic adviser to then prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
""With regards to media reports related to Grupo Cenyt, which if found to be true would be extremely serious, BBVA informs that in June 2018 it opened an investigation into the hiring and services rendered by this company,"" the bank said.
The bank said it had also hired an external law firm to conduct an independent review into the issue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent investor Jeffrey Vinik is ready to manage money for outside clients again and plans to relaunch his hedge fund firm Vinik Asset Management after sitting out the last six years.
Vinik, who once ran Fidelity's Magellan mutual fund and then oversaw $10 billion at his own hedge fund, is starting for a third time, he told Reuters on Thursday.
Based in Tampa, Florida, the 59-year-old plans to raise as much $3 billion for his portfolio and start trading within weeks, people familiar with his plans said.
Explaining that he missed competing with some of the world's biggest institutional investors, Vinik is returning just as a handful of his former rivals are throwing in the towel.
""I think hedge funds have taken their eye off the ball,"" Vinik said, adding ""Stock picking is a lost art and not many people are doing it well.""
For years hedge funds underperformed rising stock markets and last year they failed to deliver on promises to protect capital when the average stock-oriented fund lost 7 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
But Vinik, who has lived through a number of economic cycles, said the basics of greed and fear in the investment community always stay the same, and vowed he is ready to face what analysts are forecasting could be a rocky 2019.
""2019 might be bumpy but for the next 10 years, I'm bullish,"" Vinik said, adding that safeguarding his reputation as 
an investor will be a major motivating force to outperform.
""I'm not doing this to not do well,"" he said, adding that financial and technology stocks are likely to continue being profitable in the years ahead.
In 1996 when he launched his private hedge fund, Vinik's reputation was so powerful that the firm took in $800 million on day one and closed to new investors immediately.
Within four years the firm was managing $4.5 billion and it peaked at $10 billion. By the time Vinik was ready to close - the move coincided with his own move to Tampa from Boston - the firm had returned an average 17 percent a year.
Even after Vinik earned a fortune once estimated at close to $2 billion and spent some of that money on stakes in sports teams including the Tampa Bay Lightning and for a time the Boston Red Sox, he said he is the one now calling the shots at the firm. ""I am the analyst, I am doing the work,"" he said.

Tiger Global's hedge fund invests some $8 billion in assets and gained 0.9 percent in December. That compares with the fortunes of many hedge funds that lost money in December and saw their gains for the year wiped out. 
A Tiger Global spokeswoman declined to comment.
2018 was a second straight year of strong returns for Tiger Global after its hedge fund gained 28.2 percent in 2017. The average stocks-oriented hedge fund lost 6.9 percent last year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
Tiger Global, founded by Chase Coleman in 2001, has historically invested in technology companies and got a boost from betting that companies would fall, or shorting, in 2018. Performance was also fueled by bets on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).. The firm also got a boost from its investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc.

Danske Bank (CO:DANSKE) is already under investigation by authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) made through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
A Paris court began investigating Danske Bank in October 2017 after Browder said he had provided details of the Danish lender's involvement in money laundering relating to a tax fraud which had been exposed by Sergei Magnitsky in Moscow, a lawyer who died in a Russian prison in 2009.
Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia who now campaigns to expose corruption, has lobbied the European Union to bring in a ""Magnitsky Act"", the law adopted in the United States which targets human rights offenders.
Danske Bank was initially placed under investigation by a Paris court in related to suspicions of money laundering concerning transactions at its Estonian branch between 2008 and 2011, but in January last year the court changed its status to that of ""assisted witness,"" a Danske spokesman said. 
""We do not believe that we have provided incorrect information to the French authorities,"" the Danske spokesman said in response to an allegation that it did so made by Browder during a press conference in Copenhagen on Thursday.
""On the contrary, it is clearly in our interest to obtain as accurate a picture of what happened in Estonia as possible,"" the spokesman said in a statement, adding that the bank has an ongoing dialogue with the French authorities.
Browder, who in September asked the U.S. Treasury to investigate Danske Bank and to undertake steps to consider designating it for special measures under the USA Patriot Act, said he expected the French authorities to take action.
""The indication is that they are going to act on it."" 
Reuters was not immediately able to contact the French national financial prosecutor about the case.
On Wednesday, Danske Bank and four former top executives were sued by a U.S. shareholder alleging it defrauded investors and inflated its share price by hiding and failing to stop the money laundering in Estonia. 
Danske Bank said it was aware that a lawsuit has been filed in the United States.
""It is public knowledge that several U.S. law firms have indicated that similar lawsuits are on the way, so it does not come as a surprise to us,"" the spokesman said.

""We will consider the lawsuit and the further process in consultation with our legal counsel. At the present time, we have no further comments,"" he added.

Volkswagen filed the claims for damages as part of labor court disputes at the end of last year, the newspaper said, without giving details of which former employees it had targeted or how high the total damages claims might be.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.
Handelsblatt said Volkswagen has fired six managers since it admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards. It said all six were fighting their dismissals.
Volkswagen pleaded guilty in 2017 as part of a $4.3 billion U.S. settlement. In total, nine people have been charged in the diesel emissions scandal and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms.
Handelsblatt said Volkswagen was seeking to recover a large part of the 4 million euros ($4.60 million) the company paid for the defense of one of the jailed former executives, Oliver Schmidt, who was handed a seven year prison sentence in 2017.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - At the Canadian embassy in Tokyo last month, beef promoters flew in a chef from Canada to cook New York strip steaks for hungry Japanese importers and restaurant suppliers.
The annual Canadian beef buffet reception attracted 126 people, up sharply from the usual 30 to 40.
A trade deal among Pacific nations - called the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - took effect on Dec. 30 among the first six of 11 member countries to ratify it, including Canada, Japan and Australia.
CPTPP's real prize, Canadian exporters say, are reduced Japanese tariffs for beef, pork, wheat and canola oil. Japan is the world's third-largest beef importer and seventh-largest wheat buyer, often buying top-quality supplies to meet consumer demand for soft, white breads and beef raised on grain not grass. 
For Canada, following a year of volatile relations with the United States and China, the deal offers a rare opportunity to seize market share from the United States, which withdrew from the pact after President Donald Trump took office. 
Canada's opportunity illustrates the risks of Trump’s drastic trade actions. Farmers are key Trump supporters, but they have been among the hardest-hit from a trade war with China.
U.S. beef packers such as Tyson Inc and National Beef Packing Co also stand to lose, while Canadian grain exporters Richardson International and Viterra [VILC.UL] may gain. 
At the Tokyo beef buffet, enthusiasm about Canadian beef transcended borders. 
""The interest was as high as I've ever seen,"" said Dennis Laycraft, executive vice president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, who has been visiting Japan since the 1980s. ""This new agreement is one of the most significant opportunities we've seen since the original NAFTA (North American Free Trade) agreement was signed.""
Among those sampling Canadian beef were buyers from the Japanese units of Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), Laycraft said. Costco declined to comment and JBS did not respond.
In a statement, Cargill said it advocates for U.S. participation in CPTPP so that exporters and consumers do not miss out on its benefits. Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said the company wants to see a bilateral pact between the U.S. and Japan ""to ensure we remain competitive.""
Sensing opportunity, Alberta packer Harmony Beef made it a priority last year to secure Canadian and Japanese approvals allowing it to sell to Japan. Now Harmony is planning its first shipment next month of 52,000 pounds of fresh and frozen beef. 
""We put pressure on and fast-tracked the Japan approval,"" said Harmony's director of marketing Cam Daniels. ""They are an affluent society that is willing and able to pay for the best."" 
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, is Canada's second-biggest beef market after the United States. Even so, Canada's sales to Japan amounted to 27,000 tonnes from January through October 2018, about what U.S. exporters ship there in one month.
Lower tariffs boost any product's competitiveness in Japan in the long run, but short-term, preferences for specific brands as well as a country's supply capacity, are also factors, said an official at Japan's farm ministry, who was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Canada, the world's sixth-largest beef exporter overall, is the second-biggest shipper after the United States of grain-fed beef, which commands a premium over beef from grass-fed cattle. Japan's 38.5 percent beef tariff fell under CPTPP to around 27 percent, with further reductions coming. 
The U.S. National Cattlemen's Beef Association, urged the Trump Administration last month to cut trade barriers to Japan, the biggest export market for U.S. beef. 
""The U.S. beef industry is at risk of losing significant market share in Japan unless immediate action is taken to level the playing field,"" the association's president Kevin Kester said in a statement.
Other commodities are also in play.
Annual U.S. wheat sales to Japan of 3 million tonnes may fall by half over time unless the U.S. negotiates lower tariffs in upcoming bilateral talks, said Steve Mercer, vice president at U.S. Wheat Associates, which promotes the country's wheat exports.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative, asked about exporters' concerns, referred to the negotiating objectives that it outlined in December, which included reducing Japanese tariffs.
Japan typically buys 1.5 million tonnes of high-quality Canadian wheat annually, but that volume may approach 3 million tonnes over the next nine years, predicted Cam Dahl, president of Cereals Canada.
Canadian wheat sales may start to pick up in April, once Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which buys foreign grain, recalculates its re-sale price to mills, said Richardson's assistant vice president for the Asia-Pacific region, Adrian Man.
Japanese purchases of Canadian canola oil, used in cooking, already show signs of rising. Sunora Foods shipped four containers there in the past month, its biggest monthly sales to that market in recent memory, said president Steve Bank.
For pork, tariff reductions may allow Canada to surpass the United States in Japanese market share, said Kazuhito Yamashita, research director at Canon Institute for Global Studies.

""The U.S. could be left behind,"" he said. “So the U.S. must be hasty to reach an agreement.""

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","Thyssenkrupp break-up plans face economic, financial hurdles in 2019","By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) faces risks ranging from economic uncertainty to cartel fines in 2019, potentially complicating a planned spin-off of the German company's capital goods business which has so far left some investors unconvinced.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp have fallen 26 percent since September when it bowed to long-standing pressure to separate its elevators, car parts and plant engineering from steel, naval vessels and metals distribution, lagging German (GDAXI), European (STOXX) and global stocks (MIWD00000PUS).
While the break-up plan is backed by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach foundation and Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's two biggest shareholders, other investors question whether it will solve the German conglomerate's bigger problems.
""Overall, I still don't see how Thyssenkrupp will get anywhere,"" said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which represents 1 percent of the group's voting rights at its annual general meeting.
""2019 won't be the only transition year for the group. I suspect there will be quite a few,"" he said of the turmoil at Thyssenkrupp, whose chief executive and chairman left as a result of the sustained investor disquiet. 
(GRAPHIC: Thyssenkrupp shares - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SNFN0C) 
Some analysts say fears of a global economic downturn as well as potential fines over alleged cartel agreements in Germany could also hit Thyssenkrupp at a time of already stretched finances.
""Balance sheets will be an area of focus in a more severe industrial recession scenario. We see Thyssenkrupp as particularly vulnerable,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Lars Brorson wrote.
Rating the stock ""underweight"", Barclays has set a target price of 14.50 euros per Thyssenkrupp share, 10 percent below where its stock was trading on Thursday.
One top-20 shareholder, who declined to be named, said Thyssenkrupp's management still needed to prove that the break-up will result in a smaller, more agile set-up, adding: ""Simply announcing a breakup doesn't change anything.""
Thyssenkrupp, whose AGM is scheduled for Feb. 1, plans to get most of the break-up work, including a legal separation as well as top management appointments, done this year before shareholders are to approve the split in a year's time.
""The two entities will still be a disparate collection of businesses lacking synergies ... the split entities will continue to present challenges for investors to forecast and value with a likely discount to valuation,"" Morningstar analyst Denise Molina said in a note.
The main sticking point is uncertainty over Thyssenkrupp's elevator and car parts businesses, the core of the planned spin-off, partly because of an automotive industry downturn.

""The skeptical investor might worry that group management hasn't asked enough difficult questions about how margin expansion and/or order book growth has been achieved,"" a top-40 shareholder, who also declined to be named, said.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Honda to shut UK production for six days due to Brexit logistics,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Honda will shut its British operations for six days in April to help it counter any border disruption from the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. 
Carmakers have warned that their factories, which rely on the constant delivery of parts to enter production cycles, would be severely damaged if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, forcing the need for customs checks at borders. 
Honda said it had been assessing how to cope with any disruption caused by logistics and border issues following the departure on March 29. 
""To ensure Honda is well placed to adjust to all possible outcomes, we are planning 6 non-production days in April 2019,"" a spokesman said. 
""This is to facilitate production recovery activity following any delays at borders on parts. These contingency provisions have been put in place to best mitigate the risk of disruption to production operations at the Swindon factory.""
Germany's BMW has said it will move the annual maintenance shutdown period for its British Mini plant to April, in case there is no trade deal.

1275,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>","Powell Still Patient, but Balance Sheet Comments Raise Concerns","Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his statement that the FOMC would be patient on monetary policy Thursday, but he hit equity markets after raising worries again that quantitative tightening of the Fed's balance sheet would be on autopilot.
The S&P 500 was flat in afternoon trading, but sentiment on equities turned sour somewhat as Powell said the Fed's balance sheet will be ""substantially smaller,"" indicating the central bank will press ahead with its balance sheet wind-down operation, which peaked at roughly $4.5 trillion in Jan. 2015, but has now narrowed to about $4 trillion.
The Fed chief did not give a timeline for winding down the balance sheet.
On interest rates, Powell said the central bank will be ""patient,"" as it weighs the pace of global growth and domestic inflation, reaffirming investor expectations for a slower pace on monetary policy tightening.
Powell's cautious tone served as another sign that the Fed is no hurry to hike up rates and comes just a day after the release of the central bank's December meeting minutes, in which policymakers cited waning inflation, worsening financial conditions and slowing global growth as reason to 'be patient about further policy firming.
Powell also touched on the growing disparity between good momentum in economic data and concerns in financial markets over risks, stressing the underlying economy remained robust.
""Especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully as we ... figure out which of these two narratives is going to be the story of 2019,"" he said.
Powell downplayed the short-term impact of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which entered its third week Monday, but said an extended shutdown would lead to a less clear picture of the economy on which to base monetary policy decisions.
In the midst of the ongoing trade spat between the US and China, the Fed chairman said Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales warning shows growth is slowing in China, though he still expected the Chinese economy to generate ""solid growth"" this year.
Powell also expressed concern about the bulging amount of U.S. debt, which stands at about $21.9 trillion, saying he was ""worried about it.”

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>","Sen. Sanders, Rep. Cummings introduce bill to lower U.S. drug prices","By Yasmeen Abutaleb
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs for American consumers, critiquing President Donald Trump administration's efforts to curb medicine prices.
Democrats have been critical of efforts by the Trump administration to bring down drug prices after Trump, a Republican, promised to do so during his 2016 campaign and since being elected. They have said administration proposals let big drugmakers off the hook and did not do enough to help Americans. 
""I say to the president: No more talk, no more tweet. No more commotion, emotion and motion and no results,"" Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said at a news conference on Thursday. Cummings became chairman of the House Oversight Committee after Democrats regained control of the chamber this month.
""Americans want government to help them. And this is something you can do to help all Americans,"" Cummings said, addressing Trump.
The proposed legislation, which has several co-sponsors among Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Republican-led Senate, is comprised of three bills that aim to curb drug costs.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year rolled out a plan to lower drug prices and has introduced several modest proposals to curb medicine costs, but Trump has expressed frustration over continued price hikes by drugmakers.
Several pharmaceutical companies temporarily froze prices on select drugs last year. But drugmakers raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs, including the world's top-selling medicine, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Inc's Humira, to begin 2019.
In response to increased pressure, however, most drugmakers ended their practice of annual double-digit percentage increases of list prices, keeping most under 10 percent.
The Sanders and Cummings bill would peg U.S. prescription drug prices to the median price from five countries - Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan - where drug costs are typically far lower because of government price controls.
That is similar to a proposal the Trump administration said it plans to put forth in the coming months that would create an ""international pricing index"" to help the cost of prescription drugs to Medicare more closely align with other countries. The government health insurance program covers more than 40 million older and disabled Americans.
The bill would also allow the U.S. Secretary for Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prices in Medicare Part D, a program that helps Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered medicines like those purchased at drugstores.
The proposal would also end a ban that keeps Americans from buying medicines at lower prices from Canada and other countries. 
Drugmakers opposed Sanders' and Cummings' legislation, arguing that it was not the right way to address prescription drug affordability. Pharmaceutical companies have long argued that price controls in the United States would stifle innovation and that importing drugs from other countries is unsafe.
""The proposals from Senator Sanders would wreak havoc on the U.S. health care system,"" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the industry's top U.S. lobbying group, said in a statement.
""They would interfere with patient access to medicine, while also undermining the U.S. intellectual property system, replicating the flawed policies of foreign governments and circumventing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s robust safety standards,"" the group said.
They also say that rebates and discounts they must pay to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to ensure patient access to their products - and that are not passed on to consumers - forces them to keep list prices high. Trump administration proposals have singled out so-called middlemen like PBMs as a big part of the problem.
""While Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they desperately need, the pharmaceutical industry year after year makes huge profits and pays an outrageous level of compensation to their CEOs,"" Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Thursday at a news conference.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been defending the administration's efforts to lower drug prices. 

""(Trump) and I will not stop our work until list prices go down,"" Azar wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>",Trump says U.S. is having tremendous success with China on trade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was having tremendous success in its trade negotiations with China, a day after U.S. and Chinese officials concluded three days of talks in Beijing. 
The meetings in China were the first face-to-face talks since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Buenos Aires in December and agreed a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. 
Trump, a Republican, has accused China of cheating the United States on trade and stealing U.S. intellectual property, though he often has said he has a good personal rapport with Xi. 
""We're negotiating and having tremendous success with China,"" Trump told reporters as he left the White House on a trip to the U.S. border with Mexico on the 20th day of a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. He did not elaborate.
He added that he found China to be in many ways ""far more honorable"" than congressional Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Trump is locked in a stalemate with congressional Democrats over his demand for $5.7 billion in partial funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The dispute triggered a shutdown of about one-quarter of the federal government, and Trump has said he will not sign any bill to reopen the government that does not include funding for the wall. 
""I think that China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party,"" he said.
Washington has presented Beijing with a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the world’s two largest economies. They include changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other non-tariff barriers to trade.

Some 40 days into the 90-day truce, there were few concrete details on progress made so far. The meetings in Beijing this week were not at a ministerial level, so were not expected to produce a deal to end the trade war.

Tata-owned JLR , based in central England, said it will cut 4,500 out of 42,500 jobs, while Ford (N:F) said it will slash ""thousands"" of jobs as part of an overhaul that could result in plant closures and the discontinuation of some models.
A trade war between China and the United States combined with Britain's pending exit from the European Union has fragmented once global markets, forcing carmakers to reassess the profitability of individual models and locations.
In recent quarters, JLR and Ford's profits have lagged behind those of peers BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Peugeot , ramping up investor pressure on managers to stem losses. 
""We are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,"" Steven Armstrong, group vice president, Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in a statement on Thursday.
Ford Europe, which employs 53,000 people, has been losing money for years and pressure to restructure its operations has increased since arch-rival General Motors (M:G) raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France's Peugeot SAC (PA:PEUP).
JLR said demand in China, once one of its strongest countries, fell by 21.6 percent in 2018, the biggest drop of any of its markets. 
""The economic slowdown in China along with ongoing trade tensions is continuing to influence consumer confidence,"" said Jaguar Land Rover Chief Commercial Officer Felix Brautigam.
The job cuts come as Ford and JLR have been hit by a fall in demand for diesel-engined cars and after European policymakers last month agreed stricter pollution limits, forcing carmakers to accelerate investments to make electric cars.
""We believe Ford Europe could require as much as a 20 to 30 percent reduction of capacity and headcount,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Thursday.
Ford said it will seek to exit the family vans or MPV segment, review its operations in Russia, and combine the headquarters of Ford U.K. and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex to achieve a 6 percent operating margin in Europe.
""We want to be a net contributor of capital and not a net detractor,"" Armstrong told journalists on a later call, referring to Europe's financial contribution to U.S. parent Ford Motor (N:F).
Ford Europe reported a 245 million euro ($282 million) loss before interest and taxes in the third quarter, equivalent to a negative 3.3 percent EBIT margin.
JAGUAR CUTS
Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata Motors and employs around 40,000 people in Britain, on Thursday reported a 4.6 percent drop in full-year sales to just under 600,000 vehicles. It lost 354 million pounds between April and September 2018.
Automakers have been hit by a regulatory clampdown on diesel emissions ever since Volkswagen admitted to systematic cheating in 2015, leading regulators to discover massive discrepancies between real-world and theoretical pollution levels.
Diesel accounts for 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's British sales and 45 percent of global demand, the company said last year, as demand tumbles following new levies in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal. 
Ford's Armstrong said pressure to build electric and hybrid cars had forced the carmaker to make choices about where to allocate its capital. 
""In smaller vehicles the diesel decline is accelerating. It is unlikely that we will further develop small diesel engines for smaller passenger cars,"" Armstrong said. 
BREXIT 
Armstrong said any Ford layoffs and plant closures would be subject to negotiations with labor representatives, and such plans did not account for the possibility of a 'hard' exit by Britain from the European Union.
""If Brexit went in the wrong direction we would have to have another look, to mitigate that,"" Armstrong said. A Ford spokesman said the carmaker currently assumes that any Brexit deal would keep tariff-free trade between Britain and Europe.
Jaguar Land Rover Chief Executive Ralf Speth said he had serious concerns about the impact of a hard Brexit but it was not possible to predict what steps might be required if that happens.
""I don't want to make at the moment any statement about Brexit and/or the closure of the plant or further implications out of it not knowing the results from politics. We have to know first what is going on.""
Fellow carmakers Mini, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and Honda have said they would temporarily close plants in April after Brexit to avoid any disruption.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 12:09PM ET</span>","American Airlines shares fall on dour fourth quarter expectations, weigh on sector","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) shares fell as much as 11 percent on Thursday after the biggest U.S. carrier cut its estimate for a closely watched measure of performance, raising concerns that slowing global economic growth is hurting business travel.
The losses in American's shares also weighed on the broader airlines sector as slowdown fears were exacerbated by lower fuel prices, which typically lead to competitive discounting.
Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) fell as much as 5.5 percent, United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) 7.6 percent and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) 4.4 percent by midday.
""Legacies in particular have a clear risk ahead on unit revenues, and that includes American Airlines with everything from corporate, international to shutdown exposure,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said.
""It's happening a little earlier than anticipated per the American and Delta unit revenue guide downs in the fourth quarter, which is concerning.""
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) cut its quarterly unit revenue estimate last week due to lower-than-expected improvement in fares booked last minute.
A decline in fuel prices in 2016 and 2017 led U.S. airlines to discount ticket prices, hurting revenue. Investors have been concerned that the cycle may repeat itself if oil prices do not show an improvement, resulting in depressed fares.
American said it expects its fuel expense to reduce in the fourth quarter to between $2.22 and $2.27 per gallon, compared with $2.30 to $2.35 per gallon earlier.
The company now expects unit revenue, which compares sales to flight capacity, to increase about 1.5 percent in the quarter, compared with its earlier estimate of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent rise. ""We believe a change in messaging is needed at American. The company cannot continue to come out with a bullish message and then underperform all year,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said. American also lowered full-year earnings per share expectation to a range of $4.40 to $4.60, from $4.50 to $5 earlier. Analysts were expecting American to earn $4.62 per share in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
American's shares have underperformed the broader airline sector - down 36 percent in the past 12 months compared with a 16.4 percent decline in the S&P 500 Airlines index <.SPLRCAIR>.

The government set up a 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) fund this week to support Carige after the European Central Bank put it under temporary administration, following the bank's failure to raise capital from investors.
The ECB has pushed Carige to seek a merger with a stronger rival and finding a buyer is now one of the tasks of the three commissioners appointed to run Italy's tenth-largest bank.
UniCredit, led by Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, has been sounded out several times by the regulators and Carige advisers over the Genoa-based lender but has so far turned down overtures, one of the sources said.
But the source added that UniCredit might be swayed if the state offered financial support with such a deal.
UniCredit declined to comment while Carige said it would say no more after comments made by its commissioners on Wednesday.
The heads of Italy's two ruling coalition partners said on Wednesday the bank would be nationalized were public funds to be injected. Treasury Minister Giovanni Tria said he would prefer a market solution.
A second source also said UniCredit was likely to bow to pressure eventually. ""Certainly Mustier will demand that any eventual deal be done on the same conditions as Intesa Sanpaolo's acquisition of the Veneto banks,"" the source said.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Italy’s biggest retail bank, took over the good assets of Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza in 2017 for a symbolic price of one euro, securing 5 billion euros of public funding into the bargain.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",HSBC criticized as UK gender pay gap widens,"By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) is facing criticism after its latest gender pay report showed the gap between men and women's pay in its UK business widened in 2018.
The gender pay gap, which measures the difference between the average hourly salary of men and women, at Britain's biggest bank grew to 61 per cent in the year to April 2018, up from 59 per cent a year earlier.
The lender - which employs more than 40,000 people in Britain - had the widest gender pay gap of any large British company in 2017.. 
Nicky Morgan, chairman of Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, told Reuters: ""As if having one of the worst gender pay gap figures in the banking sector wasn't bad enough, HSBC now appears to have taken a further step in the wrong direction... HSBC should get on with putting this right.""
Under UK law all businesses have to submit their gender pay gap figures annually, shining a spotlight on pay discrepancies.
The average gender pay gap at all banks and building societies in 2017 was 35 percent, compared to 14 percent for all UK companies.
Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the former chief executive of Virgin Money (LON:VM), who runs the government-backed Women in Finance charter, said it was unacceptable for HSBC's gender pay gap to be moving in the wrong direction.
""They need to focus on getting it right. Set targets and make sure they hit them.""
HSBC said the large gap reflected the fact there were fewer women in senior roles and more in junior ones, reflecting an industry-wide problem. 
The bank said it was taking steps to bridge the gap, including targeting an increase in the ratio of women in senior management roles to 30 percent by 2020, from 23 percent today. 
It has committed to gender diverse shortlists for all senior roles and promotes shared parental leave and flexible working.
The Fawcett Society, a campaign group for gender equality, said HSBC's gender pay gap report ""doesn't seem up to the challenge"".

The UK's largest high street bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY) published figures showing its pay gap reduced slightly to 31.5 per cent in the year to April 2018, down from 32.8 per cent the previous year.

The largest U.S. airline cut its 2018 revenue per available seat mile forecast, causing the stock to tumble 8.4%. The outlook cut comes a week after Delta decreased its forecast for the end of the year.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Modi's 'Make in India' a casualty as steel, auto firms spar over sourcing","By Neha Dasgupta and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's steel ministry is putting pressure on automakers to use locally made steel by refusing to back down on tougher import rules despite warnings that the new regulations could disrupt the production of cars, government and industry sources said. 
The steel ministry in August announced stringent import rules for some high-grade steel products that are sourced by carmakers from countries such as Japan and South Korea but not yet manufactured in India.
India's auto industry, which includes companies such as Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI),  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), is staring at production stoppages if new tougher rules on steel imports are not relaxed, a federal minister warned in a letter.
""The shipments of the auto component industry have started getting impacted which possess significant risk of production stoppage of the whole automobile industry in the immediate future,"" Anant Geete, heavy industries minister, said in the Jan. 4 letter to steel minister, Chaudhary Birender Singh.
""There is also a risk that if the import of steel (raw material) is restricted, then the industry may go for import of the components itself which may affect the government initiative of 'Make in India',"" Geete said. 
The new rules are expected to come into effect on Feb. 17. 
The letter and the internal discussions at the steel ministry have not been previously reported. Reuters has reviewed a copy of the letter.
Despite the warning from the auto industry, the steel ministry is unlikely to back down, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
This week the ministry called the country's biggest steel producers such as  JSW Steel  (NS:JSTL) and  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC),  Steel Authority of India  Ltd (NS:SAIL) (SAIL) for a meeting with carmakers including Maruti, Hyundai, Honda and Ford.
In the meeting, which was held two days after Geete's letter to Chaudhury, the officials continued to push carmakers to work with steel companies to manufacture high-grade automotive steel locally and even form joint ventures, if needed, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
""We have told the auto companies that we need to step up local manufacturing and they need to sit with the local steel companies here to let them know the specifications because our companies are well-equipped,"" a senior government official with direct knowledge of the discussions said.
A spokesman for the ministry said talks were ongoing with foreign companies to make value-added steel in India. 
IMPORTS RISE
The steel ministry's push is the latest from Modi's administration which is desperate to check imports and show the success of its manufacturing program, aimed at building a domestic industrial base and boosting jobs and growth.
India remained a net importer of steel during April-November after exports dropped over 30 percent.
The auto industry will, however, face disruption if the import of some of these crucial steel products comes to a standstill, Vinnie Mehta, director general at the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India, told Reuters. 
The steel ministry has already granted a two-month exemption to carmakers on new quality control rules for imports which were originally due to come into effect on Dec. 18. Auto companies want an extension until the end of 2019. 
Carmakers continue to rely on imports because they say local steel companies are unable to match the quality, consistency and price, three company sources said.
An Asian carmaker which failed to source stainless steel exhaust pipes locally has instead decided to import the entire fuel exhaust system, said Sugato Sen, deputy director general at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, a trade body.
There are fears that other carmakers will do the same, which will hurt local manufacturing and jobs, he said. 
""Some suppliers are reluctant to go through the trouble, while others who are doing it have found there to be delays in getting clearances,"" Sen said. 
JSW Steel, Tata Steel, SAIL, Maruti, Hyundai, Honda and Ford did not reply to a Reuters email seeking comment.

1302,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 10:58AM ET</span>",Big Banks’ Bullish CEOs Face a Reckoning After Stock Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Sell first, ask questions later.
That’s been investors’ approach to Wall Street banks of late, and it poses a challenge for the companies as they report fourth-quarter earnings next week. Bank chiefs’ bullish views and near-record profits in their previous round of results couldn’t stop an 18 percent stock plunge last quarter. Now they’re going into the season with weaker earnings expectations as they contend with a pileup of share downgrades.
“The risk is for a negative-feedback loop” if bank heads acknowledge expectations for slowing growth or a recession, said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. analyst Mike Mayo. “By having a desire to not appear tone-deaf, they go out of their way to say there’s risk, that makes people worry, and that causes less activity.’’ Mayo himself has a positive view on big banks, which he expects to benefit from cost cuts and high credit quality.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). will be the first to report results on Monday, followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Wells Fargo & Co. on Tuesday, and others later in the week. While lenders were buoyed by a strong U.S. economy and rising interest rates for much of 2018, they’re now facing investor concerns over risks including the timing of the next recession and U.S.-China trade tensions. As a stock selloff roiled financial markets in December, banks may have missed out on opportunities to profit as their clients moved to the sidelines.
The KBW Bank Index fell 0.6 percent at 10:25 a.m. in New York. It has rebounded 4.8 percent this year after dropping almost 16 percent in December.
Here are some things to watch as banks report earnings:
Loan Growth
The four largest U.S. banks posted loan growth of just 1.5 percent in the third quarter. While fourth-quarter results are likely to include some bright spots, including strong credit quality and efficiency, gains in lending have remained modest. Wells Fargo reported a decline in average loans in the third quarter from a year earlier, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., JPMorgan and Citigroup had increases.
Deepak Puri, Americas chief investment officer for Deutsche Bank AG’s wealth-management unit, is expecting a rebound.
“We like banks” in the U.S., Puri said. “After a long time, deposits are making a comeback -- we expect banks to start generating deposits, which means they’ll be able to lend more.” Deutsche Bank Wealth Management oversees 211 billion euros ($243 billion) globally.
Puri’s not the only optimist. Billionaire Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) is betting big on banks, piling more than $13 billion into their stocks in the third quarter, regulatory filings showed in November.
Trading Revenue
The equity-market selloff last quarter posed a challenge for banks as they struggled to capitalize on extreme, but short-lived, bouts of volatility across financial markets.
“December was unlike any other that we remember in our 34 years on the street,” Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in a note to clients. “There were volatile and mostly downward markets right up to New Year’s.” That will probably translate to a poor quarter for capital-markets businesses, which may persist through the first half of this year, he wrote.
Last month, Bank of America and Citigroup executives signaled that trading revenue would be slightly lower in the fourth quarter, while JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said his company was on track to be “roughly equivalent” to a year earlier. Given the recent market turmoil, investors will be watching closely to see how those predictions panned out.
Yield Curve
Another pain point is the stubbornly flat yield curve, which has made it tougher for banks to profit by using short-term borrowing to finance long-term loans. A sustained inversion of the yield curve could also signal a recession is on the way, dimming the outlook for banks.
“Sluggish loan growth, fierce deposit competition and a difficult yield-curve environment will likely pressure earning asset growth” and net interest margins, Laurie Hunsicker, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note to clients.
Still, lenders should be able to navigate the flat-curve environment and make money, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a Bloomberg television interview.
“You can still earn a good spread,” she said. Morgan Stanley reduced its median price targets for large banks by 6 percent, citing lower market-based revenue and slower growth in net interest margins. The bar for fourth-quarter results “has moved significantly lower,” Graseck wrote in a report Tuesday.
Wealth Management
The fallout from equity markets is also likely to show up in wealth-management businesses, according to Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, who expects bank executives to set lower expectations for their divisions that oversee holdings for the affluent.
Lower fees and a decline in the value of assets under management will be a drag on wealth units, according to Marty Mosby, an analyst at broker-dealer Vining Sparks. Despite that weakness, he’s broadly optimistic on the banking sector, citing improving margins and capital deployment.
“Are the banks broken?” Mosby said. “They’re anything but broken.”

1308,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 10:28AM ET</span>",Jeff Bezos' divorce could soon make MacKenzie Bezos one of Amazon's biggest shareholders,"Jeff Bezos may soon have someone familiar looking over his shoulder when it comes to running Amazon and having substantial say about it — his soon-to-be ex-wife.
Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie,  announced Wednesday they plan to divorce after more than 25 years of marriage. Because nearly all of their $137 billion net worth is in the form of his stock in Amazon, it's highly likely that she will end up with a substantial stake in the company as part of any separation agreement. Indeed, there's a good chance that she could end up having the biggest stake in the company other than Bezos'.
""One would think so,"" said Ira Garr, a family law attorney in New York who represented Rupert Murdoch and Ivana Trump in their respective divorce cases. ""I can't see anywhere else the settlement could come from.""
Read this:  Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos may split his $137 billion fortune in half when they divorce — here's what typically happens when billionaires break up
Bezos owns about 79 million shares of Amazon's stock, which are worth about $130 billion. The shares give him a 16% stake in the company, making him its largest shareholder by far. The second largest is Vanguard, which had about 6% of Amazon shares as of last February.
Should Bezos have to give half of his shares to MacKenzie — a not-unthinkable outcome — her 39 million or so shares would give her an 8% stake in the company and vault her over Vanguard. Although she could opt for cash instead — which would force Bezos to sell off tens of millions of shares — or immediately turn around and sell the shares herself, it's likely she'll choose to hold on to her shares instead, legal experts said.
If she chose to sell — or forced Bezos to — ""the stock would go way down,"" Garr said.
The reasons why MacKenzie could end up with such a huge stake in Amazon have a lot do with where the Bezos' divorce proceedings are likely to occur.
Although the Bezoses have dwellings in different areas of the country, it's likely they'll file for divorce in Washington state, legal experts said. They have a home in the Seattle area where Amazon has its headquarters and have lived out most of their marriage there, said Deirdre Bowen, an associate professor of law at Seattle University's law school. 
""Washington seems to be the most logical place"" for the divorce proceedings, Bowen said.
That's important, because it would mean that Washington state law would govern the dissolution of the Bezoses' marriage. 
Washington is a community-property state; generally, assets acquired during a marriage are considered to be jointly held by the two parties. In the case of a divorce, those community assets have to be divvied up between the two spouses.
Community property law works a little bit differently in Washington than in other parts of the country. Unlike states such as California, Washington doesn't require community assets to be divided evenly between the two parties, legal experts note. But in the Bezoses' case, where the two have been married for a long time and the founding of Amazon took place after they got married, it's likely that's where a court would end up, said James Spencer, an adjunct professor at Seattle University's School of Law and an attorney with Brothers & Henderson.
""Considering the totality of the circumstances (as are publicly known), I think it more likely than not that a court would divide the stock roughly in half,"" Spencer said.
Legal experts such as Spencer, though, don't expect the Bezoses' case to end up being decided by a judge. Instead, they expect the two to reach a settlement out of court, whether through negotiations among themselves or between their lawyers or through arbitration proceedings. So, Washington's community-property law may not have a direct effect on the divorce's outcome.
But it's likely that MacKenzie will use it — and the assumption that she should get half of the couples' community assets — as a starting point for negotiations, Bowen said.
""She can go in and tell her attorney ... to work with the assumption that it's going to be 50-50,"" she said.
To be sure, MacKenzie could end up with a far smaller stake in Amazon than half of Bezos' current holdings. If they signed a pre- or post-nuptial agreement, for example, such a contract could severely limit her claims on Bezos' shares in the company.
Amazon representatives did not respond to an email inquiry about whether the Bezoses had such an agreement.
Another complicating factor is how negotiators for the two parties — and potentially an arbiter or judge — classify Bezos' stock holdings. Although assets acquired in marriage or the amount by which they appreciate are generally considered community property, courts can make a distinction between passive and active appreciation of assets, Bowen said.
Bezos could potentially argue that the massive increase in the value of his Amazon stock was due largely to his personal active management of the company and had nothing to do with MacKenzie. Should he take that stance and have it affirmed by a judge or arbiter, MacKenzie could end up with a much smaller stake in Amazon than she might otherwise.
He could argue his Amazon stake ""should remain mine,"" Bowen said.
The outcome of the case also will hinge in large part on the mental and emotional state Bezos and MacKenzie are in going into it. In their joint statement announcing the divorce, the two portrayed their parting as amicable. But late Wednesday,  reports in the New York Post and the National Enquirer charged that Bezos has been having an affair with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez, which could indicate their separation wasn't all that friendly.
If there's rancor involved, it could have a major effect on what each party will demand and settle for, Bowen said.
""The wild card here is I don't know the psychology each party has going into this divorce,"" Bowen said.
MacKenzie could end up demanding a large cash payout, she said.
""I don't think she's an unreasonable person, so I don't see that happening,"" Bowen said. But, she added, MacKenzie could say in the proceedings something like, ""'Why would I want Amazon stock when you're controlling it? I want you removed from my life.'""
And there's another potential wrinkle. Amazon's board and Bezos himself may be uncomfortable and unwilling to hand over that much of the company's stock to MacKenzie, particularly if the two are at odds. The board or Bezos may push to limit her ownership, either by having Bezos sell shares and give her her stake in cash or by giving her other assets, such as his ownership of the Washington Post or rocket company Blue Origin, instead.
""With someone who is as closely associated to his brand as Jeff Bezos, it may be that he will refuse a settlement that gives his ex-wife that much Amazon corporate power,"" said Terry Price, a family law professor at the University of Washington's School of Law."

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",HSBC to pay $30 million to settle bond rigging lawsuit in U.S.,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) has agreed to pay $30 million to settle litigation by investors who accused 11 big banks of rigging the roughly $9 trillion government agency bond market from 2009 to 2015.
The settlement with the British bank was made public late Wednesday night in the federal court in Manhattan, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos.
HSBC is the third bank to settle, after  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) agreed in August 2017 to pay a respective $48.5 million and $17 million and cooperate with the plaintiffs.
Investors led by two Alaska government entities and the Iron Workers Pension Plan of Western Pennsylvania accused banks of colluding to manipulate prices of U.S. dollar-denominated supranational, sub-sovereign and agency bonds.
They said the banks used chatrooms and other means to share price data and coordinate trading, effectively functioning as a single ""super-desk,"" to reduce competition and boost profit on ""virtually every trade"" at customers' expense.
""Rare is an antitrust case like this one, where a large volume of 'smoking gun' evidence exists at the pleading stage,"" they said in an amended complaint filed on Nov. 13.
HSBC denied liability, but settled to avoid more litigation that could prove ""extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming,"" according to its settlement agreement.
It also agreed to cooperate with the plaintiffs, including by providing evidence such as electronic chats among the banks.
A spokesman, Rob Sherman, declined additional comment on Thursday.
The remaining defendants include  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN), Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604), Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) and  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD).
Ramos has yet to rule on their requests to dismiss the amended complaint.
He had dismissed an earlier version of the complaint last Aug. 24, but gave the investors another chance to prove their case.
The Manhattan federal court is home to a slew of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to rig various financial markets, interest rate benchmarks and commodities.

The case is In re: SSA Bonds Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 16-03711.

JLR builds a higher proportion of its cars in Britain than any other major or medium-sized carmaker and has spent millions preparing for Brexit, in case of tariffs or customs checks.
But it lost 354 million pounds ($450 million) between April and September 2018 and had already cut around 1,000 roles in Britain, shut its Solihull plant for two weeks and announced a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich site.
JLR's chief executive Ralf Speth said on Thursday he needed to go further as part of the company's turnaround plan. 
""We are taking decisive action to help deliver long-term growth, in the face of multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions as well as technology challenges facing the automotive industry,"" Speth said. 
JLR, which became Britain's biggest carmaker in 2016, had been on course to build around 1 million vehicles by the turn of the decade, reported a 4.6 percent drop in full-year sales to just under 600,000 vehicles.
It has hired staff in China and Slovakia in recent years as it opens new plants and last year unveiled plans to cut costs and improve cash flows by 2.5 billion pounds.
Speth warned in September that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and posed a production threat. 
Ford also said on Thursday it will cut thousands of jobs in Europe, exit unprofitable markets and discontinue loss-making vehicle lines as part of a turnaround effort aimed at improving profit margins in the region.
Several companies have warned of a slowdown in China and the effect of trade wars just as automakers pump billions into greener technologies to meet stricter emissions rules and customers shun combustion engines in the face of higher levies. 
BREXIT WARNINGS
Demand in China, which had once been one of its strongest countries but has since been hit by a slowdown, fell by 21.6 percent, the biggest drop of any of its markets. 
""The economic slowdown in China along with ongoing trade tensions is continuing to influence consumer confidence,"" said JLR Chief Commercial Officer Felix Brautigam. 
Diesel accounts for 90 percent of the firm's British sales and 45 percent of global demand, the company said last year, as demand in the segment tumbles following new levies in the wake of the 2015 Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions cheating scandal. 
The firm's chief financial officer said in October that the firm's Changshu plant in China ""has basically been closed for most of October in order to allow the inventory of both our vehicles and dealer inventory to start to reduce."" 
Like fellow automakers, the company could see its three British car factories grind to a halt in fewer than 80 days if lawmakers next week reject a deal by Prime Minister Theresa May, leading to tariffs and customs checks after a no-deal outcome.
""Given the difficulties that they're going through... to add further costs and further disruption from a no-deal Brexit, it's clear why they've been so clear that this would be against their interests,"" said business minister Greg Clark.
BMW-owned car brand Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) is also taking steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit but called on the government to prevent that outcome.

""We urge the government to avoid any hard Brexit,"" Chief Executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes said.

Sales from Macy's stores and third-party licensees open for more than 12 months is now expected to grow about 2 percent, lower than a prior forecast of between 2.3 percent and 2.5 percent.
""The holiday season began strong – particularly during Black Friday and the following Cyber Week, but weakened in the mid-December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement.
Macy's weak holiday forecast follows downbeat numbers from rivals J.C. Penney Corp (N:JCP) and  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS).
Macy's said that the overall sales growth was largely offset due to underperformance in certain categories such as women's sportswear, fashion jewelry and cosmetics as well as challenges in fulfilling online orders after a fire in its distribution center.

The Cincinnati-based company also cuts its forecast for sales and profit for the year, after it had raised its annual earnings outlook in anticipation of a strong holiday shopping season in November.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 08:21AM ET</span>",Nike's Dutch tax status investigated by EU regulators,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has opened an investigation into the tax treatment of  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) in the Netherlands, saying this may have given the U.S. sportswear maker an illegal advantage.
The Nike case, announced on Thursday, follows other probes by the EU executive since 2013 into tax schemes in Belgium, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands it says allow companies to establish structures to reduce their taxes unfairly.
The countries have been ordered to recover the tax from beneficiaries of such schemes, which have included Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)  and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA).
The Commission said in a statement that Dutch authorities had issued five tax rulings from 2006 to 2015, two of which are still in force, endorsing a method to calculate the royalty payments to two Nike entities based in the Netherlands.
The EU executive, which oversees competition policy in the 28-member European Union, said that, at this stage, it was concerned that the royalty payments endorsed by the rulings ""may not reflect economic reality"".
""Member states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors,"" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Nike said it was subject to and ensured that it complied with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands.
""We believe the European Commission’s investigation is without merit,"" a Nike spokesperson said.
The Dutch finance ministry said it would cooperate with the Commission's investigation and said that it agreed tax rulings should provide certainty and not preferential treatment.
The Commission has pushed governments to tighten taxation rules in response to revelations in the so-called LuxLeaks and the Panama and Paradise Papers, but some countries have resisted EU-wide changes.
Vestager did say she welcomed actions taken by the Netherlands to reform its corporate taxation rules and to help to ensure that companies operate on a level playing field.
The Commission said its new investigation concerned the tax treatment of two Nike companies based in the Netherlands - Nike European Operations Netherlands BV and Converse Netherlands BV - which market and record sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
They received licenses to use intellectual property rights of Nike and Converse products in the region in return for tax-deductible royalty payments to two other Nike entities also based in the Netherlands, but not taxable there.
The Commission said the royalty payments appeared higher than what independent companies would have agreed between themselves. As a result the Netherlands may have allowed the Nike companies to pay a lower amount of tax. If this was confirmed, it would amount to illegal state aid. 
The Commission will allow the Netherlands and interested parties to submit comments.

The Commission is also conducting an in-depth investigation into Dutch tax rulings in favor of IKEA and an investigation into a tax scheme for multinationals in Britain.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>","Looking past Khashoggi, investors flock to Saudi Arabia bond sale","By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Foreign investors flocked to buy Saudi Arabia's first dollar bonds since Jamal Khashoggi's death, in a clear vote of market confidence after the country's reputation was damaged over the journalist's murder.
The finance ministry in Riyadh said on Thursday the order book for the $7.5 billion sale of longer-term debt sale peaked at $27.5 billion, with final pricing only a few basis points above corresponding secondary market yields.
Almost all the paper was bought by foreign investors, with U.S.-based buyers in particular snapping up 40 percent of the bond due in 2029 and 45 percent of the note due in 2050. Middle East buyers only got 3 percent and 2 percent of the two issues, respectively.
Riyadh's stock among investors took a hit with the killing of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, for which a definitive explanation has yet to emerge, and as the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen have become clearer.
But this week's sale coincided with improved conditions across emerging markets, with yields compressing over the past few weeks, and Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, on Wednesday called it ""opportunistic"".
A second analyst said the impact of the Khashoggi case was fading.
SHRINKING YIELD PREMIUM
Hit by slumping oil prices, Saudi Arabia has become one of the biggest emerging market issuers, having sold $52 billion in international bonds since its debut in 2016. It plans to boost borrowing this year, along with state spending.
It started marketing the bonds at around 40 basis points above its existing curve, but spreads were progressively tightened and final pricing on the $4 billion 2029 tranche was around 15-20 bps above and +25 bps on the $3.5 billion 2050 tranche.
""Timing-wise this is great, because risky assets are in vogue – 2019 went off like crazy and investors want to put their money to work,"" Philipp Good, chief executive and head of portfolio management at Fisch Asset Management, said on Wednesday.
Sergey Dergachev, functional head of EM corporate debt and senior portfolio manager at Germany-based Union Investment, said he thought investors had relegated the Khashoggi case to the background, ""especially since some significant government reshuffling two weeks ago.""
The sale - arranged by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and NCB Capital - was also the first this year by a Gulf borrower, and comes as crude prices recover.
Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia announced a slight rise in its crude oil reserves on Wednesday after they were independently audited.
""When you issue first or among (the) first in early January ...investors have cash balances to be put to work,"" Dergachev added.
Saudi's public debt amounted to 560 billion riyals ($150 billion) or 19.1 percent of GDP in 2018, and the budget forecasts a rise to 678 billion riyals or 21.7 pct of GDP this year.

The country is rated A1 by Moody's and A+ by Fitch.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:42AM ET</span>",U.S. buyback market support may wane in 2019,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies' shopping spree for their own shares helped put a floor on market declines in 2018. Don't look for the same level of support in 2019.
Wall Street's recent volatility has optimists betting that buybacks could provide the market with an even better buffer in 2019. But many strategists see the lift from buybacks - a major factor behind the bull market - losing some force as earnings growth slows while tax policy bonanzas fizzle out.
""Companies bought back around 2.8 percent of shares outstanding in 2018. That was a substantial support to the market and bigger than dividends,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. 
""(In 2019) we expect the corporate firepower behind share buybacks to be diminished. The growth in cash flow will be slower.""
Last year will likely go in the books as a record for buybacks. Through the first three quarters of the year companies bought $583.4 billion of their own stock, just shy of 2007's full-year record of $589.1 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data.
But even that was insufficient to prevent 2018 ending with a resounding thud for U.S. stocks as the S&P 500 (SPX) tumbled nearly 20 percent from its late-September high, although it probably prevented losses from being even deeper. For the year, the index fell 6.2 percent, its poorest showing in a decade.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. cash repatriation trends - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SaiAWb)
FOREIGN PROFIT REPATRIATION SLOWS
Strategists say U.S. companies will spend heavily again on their own shares in 2019 as they have plenty of cash and tend to favor buybacks over dividends and major capital investments in times of economic and policy uncertainty.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has forecast a 44 percent jump in buybacks to $770 billion for 2018, with growth slowing to a 22 percent rise to $940 billion for 2019.
But the market clout from buybacks will likely dwindle without the cash boost from a 2018 tax break on earnings brought home from overseas and the slashing of corporate tax rates.
After rushing home some $295 billion of foreign profits in the first quarter of 2018, the pace of repatriation by U.S. multinationals has since slowed sharply, Commerce Department data shows. In the third quarter that was down to about $93 billion.
About $190 billion, or about a third, of repatriated funds were used on buybacks in the first three quarters of 2018, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. But if repatriation keeps decelerating the buyback boost will dissipate, he said. 
Slower 2019 buyback growth would be partly due to a difficult earnings comparison with 2018, when Republicans cut corporate tax rates. Wall Street is expecting S&P 500 earnings growth of 6.7 percent in 2019, down from estimates for 23.5 percent growth in 2018, according to Refinitiv's IBES.
Any resolution to U.S.-China trade tensions might also weigh on buybacks.
The uncertainty generated by the dispute made companies more comfortable using surplus cash on buybacks rather than new capital investments. Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, expects that to continue until a deal is reached. 
After that happens, the emphasis could switch to capital spending, he said.
(GRAPHIC: History of S&P gains and retreats with buyback trends - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SbIngu)
FEEDING THE BULL 
Buybacks have been a major support to the bull market that began in March 2009. S&P 500 companies bought roughly $4.5 trillion worth of their own shares, equal to about a third of the benchmark's $15 trillion gain in value over that time, according to Audrey Kaplan, head of global equity strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. 
Kaplan expects 2019 spending on buybacks to stall around 2018 levels as companies weigh slower earnings growth against strong cash balances. But the sharp fall in stock prices in late 2018 means companies can buy more shares. 
""Corporate managers should find share prices attractive at these levels,"" she said. 
Datatrek Research said U.S. companies tend to spend between 40 percent and 60 percent of operating income on buybacks and only breach the low end in ""the direst times."" 
So even if earnings were to decline, buybacks would not disappear but would fall at the same rate as earnings, according to Datatrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas. 

""The amount of buybacks hasn't peaked but the growth in buybacks perhaps has peaked,"" said Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in Dallas. ""You just won't have the same amount of tailwind.""

The meetings, first reported by French newspaper Le Figaro, come a day before Japanese prosecutors are expected to indict the Renault boss and former Nissan chairman on more charges.
Nissan declined to comment on the meeting, and a Renault spokesman did not return calls and messages seeking comment.
Both boards would be updated on the situation, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Nissan directors might discuss ongoing efforts to improve compliance controls in the wake of the scandal, while the Renault meeting would be informal, they said.
Ghosn and senior Nissan director Greg Kelly have been charged in Japan with failing to disclose $43 million in additional compensation for 2010-15 that Ghosn had arranged to be paid later.
Both men deny that the deferred compensation agreements were illegal or required disclosure.
Ghosn, who remains in detention, is likely to be formally charged with aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008, and for understating his compensation for three more years through 2018, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier.
A member of Ghosn's Japan-based legal team earlier told Reuters that Ghosn did not attend an interrogation session scheduled for Thursday due to a fever, and that he had been advised by a detention center physician to rest.
Whereas Nissan ousted Ghosn as chairman within days of his arrest, Renault has so far maintained him as chairman and CEO, deepening tensions within their 20-year-old carmaking alliance.

LONDON (Reuters) - The early-year rally in world stocks ran out of steam in Europe on Thursday and the dollar touched a near-three-month low, as mixed signals from U.S.-China trade talks and caution at the Federal Reserve applied the brakes.
China said the three days of talks in Beijing had established a ""foundation"" to resolve differences, but gave virtually no details on key issues at stake. 
A slew of weak data also dampened the mood. Again in China, factory-gate inflation was the slowest in more than two years, while worse-than-expected industrial figures in France provided more evidence that Europe is spluttering again.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.4 percent as Paris dropped 0.8 percent, Germany's trade-sensitive DAX dipped and Britain's FTSE also fell as Brexit confusion continued to reign.
Wall Street futures were in the red, putting the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq on course for their first drop in five days.
""I am beginning to get a little concerned about the path of the European industrial data,"" said  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets' head of strategy, Michael Metcalfe.
""It is raising the possibility of a technical recession in Europe. One of the big challenges is that, if this is replicated in Italy's data tomorrow, that potentially brings the budget questions back into the market's thoughts.""
The soured sentiment saw the standard move into safe-haven government bonds that give a guaranteed return. Yields on German and French and government bonds - which move inversely to price - dropped toward recent two-year lows. [GVD/EUR]
The European Central Bank will publish the minutes from its December meeting later, where it formally shut the mass bond buying program it has been using in recent years.
U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.697 percent, down from 2.710 percent on Wednesday, when Fed minutes showed policymakers were becoming more cautious about future rate hikes.
The dollar remained flat after hitting its lowest level since mid-October. 
It was barely changed at $1.1556 to the euro, which had gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June.
China's yuan also muscled higher, breaching the 6.8 per dollar level for the first time since August in both onshore and offshore trade in Asia.
""This drop in the dollar is an overdue correction following a surprisingly robust few weeks, despite the massive collapse in U.S. rate expectations,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
OIL SLIPS 
Asian shares had performed fractionally better overnight on the weaker dollar and hopes of more economic stimulus in China.
But many stocks seesawed, and Tokyo and Shanghai both closed lower as markets parsed the trade talks and hoped that they will ultimately avert another ramping-up of U.S. tariffs in March.
Emerging market bond investors then got a major jolt as Lebanon's finance minister Ali Hassan Khalil told a local newspaper that it was weighing up a debt restructuring. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) had warned this week that such a move, if extreme enough, could potentially wipe out Lebanon's banks.
""The exposure of Lebanese banks to the sovereign (local debt and Eurobonds), amounts to some 55 trillion Lebanese pounds, almost double the 30 trillion LBP capital base of the banking system,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
Lebanon has the third largest public debt-to-GDP ratio in the world at around 150 percent.
Oil also caught investors' attention as Brent and U.S. crude fell back $1, having jumped overnight on signs of OPEC-led crude output cuts.
Brent crude was last trading 1.4 percent lower at $60.58 a barrel and U.S. WTI was down 1.5 percent at $51.57 cents. Industrial metals such as copper dipped a touch too. 
Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at the foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said he viewed more gains in oil prices as a key driver for any further rise in risk appetite.

If U.S. crude futures can break through the $55 level, ""you're going to see real yields probably lower. That's really good for the cost of money and taking some further headwinds out of the U.S. dollar,"" he said.

1345,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- AT&T T,"AT&T (T) stands apart from its rivals due to its impressive dividend history. AT&T has increased its dividend for 35 consecutive years, showing the ability to grow in a wide range of economic environments (including recessions), observes dividend expert Ben Reynolds, editor of Sure Retirement. 
In addition to a long history of dividend growth, AT&T also has an exceptionally high dividend yield that has been north of 6.5% recently. This yield is historically high for AT&T. 
The company’s average dividend yield in 2009 – the worst year of the Great Recession when stock prices collapsed — was 6.4%. AT&T is trading at bargain prices today, despite its long history of success and stable cash flows.
The reason for AT&T’s low stock price and corresponding high yield is concerns over the company’s large acquisitions of both DirecTV and Time Warner. These acquisitions have leveraged AT&T’s balance sheet. The company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.8x at the end of fiscal 2018.
Management is prioritizing debt reductions. The company expects to reduce its debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2019.
AT&T expects tremendous free cash flows (operating income less capital expenditures) of $26 billion in fiscal 2019 against an interest expense of approximately $8.5 billion and dividends in the range of $14 to $15 billion. This leaves billions in additional cash flows to pay down debt.
While the market is penalizing AT&T for debt incurred from its recent acquisitions, it has failed to recognize the increased cash flow and growth potential of AT&T resulting from the same acquisitions.
Synergies from the TimeWarner acquisition are expected to reach $2.5 billion annually by 2021, with $1.5 billion of that being cost reductions. The TimeWarner acquisition significantly boosts AT&T’s content creation ability.
The company is well positioned to grow earnings-per-share and dividends for years to come. Pessimism and resulting low share prices and high yields make now an opportune time to invest in AT&T for the long run.

Toronto- WDO,"Right now, Wesdome Gold Mines (Toronto: WDO) is probably, in my opinion, the most likely company to get taken out in the gold space in 2019, suggests Ralph Aldis, a resource sector specialist and a portfolio manager for U.S. Global Investors.
They have two operating mines at the Eagle River Complex in Ontario that share a central mill. It also has the Kiena Complex in Quebec that is basically being redeveloped.
There have been some great drill holes at the mines there, and in some cases, multi-ounce per ton. The mine is starting to shape up to be a real gem and if it restarts it will be a big catalyst.
The gentleman running Wesdome, CEO Duncan Middlemiss, is doing a great job. People I know were throwing term sheets at him all this past year to see if he wanted to raise some money.
But Duncan recognized that he didn’t need to raise any money. Instead, he’s been putting money in the bank by producing gold at a profit and has continued to execute and put out good drill results.
I think this is one of these companies similar to where Alamos Gold went and bought Richmont Mines Inc. or when you had SSR Mining buy Claude Resources. Wesdome is geographically situated in a very safe jurisdiction and has a lot of prospectivity.

1347,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- AstraZeneca PLC AZN,"Based in the UK, AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) focuses on treatments for respiratory, autoimmune, and metabolic conditions, as well as on cardiology, neurology, and oncology drugs, explains John Eade, analyst with the leading independent research firm, Argus Research.
While most companies in the Big Pharma group have moved beyond the patent cliff phase and are beginning to grow, AstraZeneca has lagged, as it faces pricing pressure and generic threats to its former blockbusters Nexium (for ulcers) and Crestor (for high cholesterol).
Management is taking steps to address these challenges by cutting costs and assembling a strong new drug pipeline, including a promising checkpoint inhibitor, Imfinzi, to treat various cancers.
Imfinzi has now been approved as a first-line treatment for lung cancer in the EU, in addition to the U.S., and as a treatment for bladder cancer. It is also being submitted as a treatment for early-stage lung cancer.
There’s more in the pipeline. EU and Japanese regulatory decisions are expected on Forxiga for type-1 diabetes in 2H19. Lezepelumab, a treatment for severe asthma, has received a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA.
There is a solid combination of growth & income. We expect AstraZeneca’s pipeline and management’s focus on cost-cutting to return the company to growth in 2019. The yield of 3.4% is above the Big Pharma industry average. Our12-month target price is $46.

1348,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Tesla TSLA,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is disrupting the world of renewable energy and electric powered vehicles. That’s a noble cause and hopefully it will save the world from global warming, asserts Todd Shaver, editor of Bull Market Report.
These are some of the core values that drive the vision. But there is so much more about this company and its future. Just like Steve Jobs, Tesla creates beautiful products using revolutionary technology that make an instant connection with their audience.
There is a unique combination of talents in the mindset of Elon Musk. On one hand, he is a global thinker on the scale of great visionaries like Richard Branson. On the other, his products are created with extreme attention to the most minuscule detail in design and engineering. That’s pure Steve Jobs.
For the third quarter of 2018 the company reported a huge profit of $310 million. This was a shock to Wall Street and the stock promptly rallied from $260 to $340 in less than three weeks. It appears that the company will not have to raise additional capital through stock sales or borrowing. The Street loved it.
We have driven a Tesla, and it is the best car we have ever seen. And most people that own one feel the same way. Revenues last quarter were $6.82 billion, up from $2.98 billion the year before.
They are producing 6000 Model 3’s a week now, and demand appears to remain through the roof as they have almost $1 billion in customer deposits.
The founder, Elon Musk, has calmed down and has mostly shut down his Twitter account, and just recently added Larry Ellison to the board of directors. A new age has arisen with this company and we wouldn’t be surprised to see a 4-digit stock price in the next few years.

1349,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Repligen RGEN,"Repligen (RGEN) is a pure-play supplier of bioprocessing technologies. It is a market leader in proteins (over 95% market share), where it has a near monopoly, explains Tyler Laundon, editor of Cabot Small-Cap Confidential.
Meanwhile, the company is coming on strong in both chromatography and filtration, which are both growing at over 20% in 2018. These solutions help customers overcome capacity, cost, quality and time pressures. It has a market cap of $2.3 billion.
Repligen is as much a partner as a supplier to its customers given the heavily regulated nature of bioprocessing and the strategic importance its products play in the drug approval and manufacturing process.
Customers are large biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations, including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma. Repligen also does business with life science companies, diagnostic companies and laboratory researchers. This 60/40 mix of clinical and commercial exposure gives Repligen a relatively stable, long-term growth profile.
Repligen has grown revenue at an average annual rate of 31% for the past three years and EPS at an average pace of 38%. In 2017, revenue jumped 35% to $141 million while EPS soared 43% to $0.70. Through the first three quarters of 2018 revenue is up 43% while EPS is up $0.02 to $0.52.
Management updated 2018 revenue guidance above consensus ($188 million) to a range of $191 million to $194 million (implying 35% to 37% growth) and adjusted EPS above consensus ($0.71) to a range of $0.71 to $0.75. Repligen ended Q3 with $190 million in cash and equivalents, implying plenty of room for more M&A activity.

In December the markets took many quality small cap biotechs down to historic low prices, observes Bill Mathews, small cap expert and editor of The Cheap Investor.
One of those stocks is Achillian Pharmaceuticals (ACHN), a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and commercializes small molecule drug therapies for immune system disorders in the United States.
Its lead drug candidate includes ACH-4471, an inhibitor of factor D that is in Phase II clinical trials for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and C3 glomerulopathy.
The company is also developing ACH-5228, a factor D inhibitor that is in Phase I clinical trial; ACH-5548, a factor D inhibitor; and other factor D inhibitors.
It has license agreements with GCA Therapeutics, Ltd. and Ora, Inc., as well as a collaboration arrangement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop and commercialize drug candidates for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus.
We like ACHN because the company has several products in FDA Trials, collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies and a large amount of cash. As of the end of its latest quarter, ACHN has $283 million ($2.05 a share) in cash.
The company expects its burn rate to be about $63-65 million for the year, and at that current rate, it should have cash for about four years. ACHN has a book value of $2.02 and no debt.
The stock has huge institutional ownership, with149 institutions owning 79% of the float. Its two largest shareholders, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard, each own about 12 million shares. We think positive FDA news could move the stock price up to the $3-5 level.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>","At China port, tariff drop a salve for hard-hit traders of American cars","By Yilei Sun and Adam Jourdan
TIANJIN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In the Chinese port city of Tianjin, gray market traders of American-made cars, badly stung by a scything trade war and punitive tit-for-tat tariffs, are scrambling to take advantage of an opportunity they fear may prove only temporary.
At a car ""supermarket"" near the city's busy harbor, importers told Reuters they were rushing to get ""Made in America"" cars through customs and revving up orders after Beijing temporarily cut tariffs on U.S. autos from Jan. 1.
The activity at the port - after a freeze since China hit U.S. auto imports with a 40 percent tariff last July - illustrates how ebbs and flows in the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing are impacting global businesses.
""Our business was harshly hit in 2018. Sales fell steeply and we were forced to hold cars in bonded zones to wait for tariffs to be cut,"" said Kevin Li, a dealer at the port whose firm brings in U.S.-made luxury sport utility vehicles (SUVs). 
""Now we are discussing with dealers in the U.S. to start importing more cars once again."" 
The higher tariffs have hit premium carmakers who import a large portion of the vehicles they sell in China, including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Lincoln brand, and Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which both have manufacturing in the United States.
Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators have been locked in talks in Beijing this week in a bid to end the trade tensions that have rocked markets. Those talks wrapped up on Wednesday, with hopes growing that a deal could be struck.
(U.S. car exports to China breakdown amid trade war png: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SDxiVD)
The two countries' leaders struck a 90-day trade truce last month after talks on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina, which saw China's steep levies on autos trimmed back for a three-month period until the end of March.
In the first ten months of 2018, U.S. passenger vehicle exports to China, excluding those for public transport, were just under $6 billion, down from over $8.5 billion in the same period the year before.
Since the middle of last year, when China raised tariffs, U.S. car exports to China have plunged between 35-55 percent each month versus the year before, far more steeply than in the first half of the year.
Shortly after the Chinese announcement, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler and BMW cut their prices for imported U.S.-made cars to make their cars more affordable. 
An official at China's main car dealers' association said he expected formal imports by carmakers to revive over the next few months given the lower tariffs. Reuters could not immediately confirm if numbers had already started to climb. 
BUYERS RETURN
Car dealers at the port, however, said customers had started to return late last month.
""We notice significantly more customers coming since the announcement of the tariff cut on U.S.-made cars,"" said Peter Liu, a dealer at the port, who imports cars from the United States including Mercedes-Benz and Land Rover SUVs.
Liu's firm is offering 10-15 percent discount to customers to bring in much-needed cashflow after a tough six months with his cars stuck paying fees in portside parking lots to avoid the steep levies.
""The tariff cut on U.S.-made cars has pushed us to now clear our cars parked in bonded zone through customs. We already successfully submitted documents to clear two Benz GLS 450s,"" Liu said.
Rival dealer Kevin Li said he was bringing 20 Mercedes-Benz SUVs through customs, making use of the tariff drop ""window"" to bring in cars even without firm orders.
That was a gamble, with overall demand still weak, he acknowledged. 
Data shows China's domestic car market likely contracted last year for the first time since 1990 and analysts say it isn't likely to turn around soon.
""There is a risk that car sales won't be that good in the first quarter, but we need to make use of the tariff drop,"" he said. ""We are paying for the tariff before receiving orders.""
WINDOW CLOSING?
The gray market trade in Tianjin is only a part of China's auto market, the world's largest, but it gives an important insight into the auto import trade. While carmakers prefer importing their own vehicles, Beijing has been encouraging alternative channels, fueling gray market growth.
This gray market channel made up roughly 14 percent of all imported cars in China in 2017, almost double the 7.7 percent in 2014, according to data from China's biggest auto importer, Sinomach Automobile Co Ltd (SS:600335).
Tianjin is the biggest port in China in terms of parallel car imports, bringing in around 70 percent of country's overall parallel car imports, according to a Commerce Ministry report.
Dealers estimate there are more than 10,000 U.S.-made cars sitting in the port's bonded zones.
With no guarantee the lower tariff window would not close again at the end of March, firms were rushing to bring cars in, dealers and industry insiders said.
Su Hui, a senior official at the China Automobile Dealers Association's parallel car chamber, said it took around two months to complete the process from ordering a U.S.-made car to completing customs clearance in China.
""So there is not much time for importers,"" he said.
The rush could also put pressure on customs in major Chinese ports, including Tianjin, Shanghai and Zhoushan.
Leo Liu, a Shanghai-based dealer at Yuanfang Global who sells 700 U.S.-imported cars a year, told Reuters his firm was clearing 100 vehicles at Shanghai Waigaoqiao since the tariff cut announcement. 

""But there are so many uncertainties, so we need to hurry up,"" Liu told Reuters.

Still battling to recover from a 2015 emissions test cheating scandal and facing tighter European environmental rules, the German automaker has been trying to boost sales and cut costs to fund an ambitious shift to electric cars and automated driving.
At the same time, trade disputes with China driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies have caused uncertainty in the global auto industry. 
""2019 will once again be a year of enormous challenges for the brand, aside from volume growth we will focus even more on our profitability,"" Chief Operating Officer Ralf Brandstaetter said.
VW brand sales rose 0.2 percent last year thanks to growth in South America, the United States and Europe, compensating for a decline in China and difficulties registering cars following the introduction of Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WTLP) emissions standards.
The numbers do not include sales under the Audi, Porsche, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Seat brands, which are also owned by Volkswagen. 
The VW brand increased market share in China in 2018 but its vehicle sales fell 2.1 percent with the world's largest passenger car market on track for an annual sales contraction not seen since at least 1990.
For the wider Asia-Pacific region, sales dropped 1.7 percent.
""This decline is mainly due to developments in China, where consumer restraint continues in an uncertain macroeconomic environment,"" the company said. 
Despite rising 3.6 percent for the year, European sales took a hit after stricter anti-pollution rules were introduced in September. 
""2018 was marked by significant uncertainty in some regions, especially in the second half,"" VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann said in a statement, but he added that new products had helped offset that.
The company sold around 50,000 electric and hybrid cars, a 13 percent increase compared with 2017.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 06:03AM ET</span>",Cash can beat stocks in returns and happiness,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - How bad was 2018 for investors? They pulled a record amount of money from stock and bond funds late in 2018 and tucked it into safe havens such as CDs, money market funds or U.S. Treasuries that mature in a year or less.
In better times, investors usually use bonds as a buffer when stocks turn nasty, but last year stock and bond funds alike were losers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 fell 4 percent for the year and the bond funds tracked by Lipper, on average, dropped 1.7 percent. Meanwhile, the top money market funds provided returns of more than 2.4 percent.
“The flight to safety was perplexing because this was not a 2008 market meltdown, but I don’t think people are willing to wait anymore to see,” said Tom Roseen, Lipper Head of Research.
Among the concerns gnawing at investors: uncertainty about interest rate increases, the U.S. trade dispute with China and slowing global growth. 
“This is the first time in years, that I have been looking at cash as a viable asset class,” said Linda Erickson, a Greensboro, North Carolina certified financial planner.
Every quarter last year she advised clients to sell 2 percent of their stock portfolio and add the money to a money market fund. The goal was to create a safe stash that would not suffer losses in bonds if interest rates continued to rise. With some money market funds and savings accounts yielding more than 2 percent, parking cash was far more acceptable in 2018 over previous years where interest rates were closer to zero for the same accounts.
When shopping for high-yield bank accounts beware of rules such as minimum deposits or balance requirements and make sure your money is FDIC insured. 
Certificates of deposit may pay up to 2.7 percent now if you are willing to tie up your money for a year, but in the current environment, there is little need to commit money for long periods or to use brokers for safe investments. People can buy 13-week Treasury bills paying about 2.4 percent through the federal government’s Treasury Direct program (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/tdhome.htm).
Portland, Oregon certified financial planner Theodore Haley put about a quarter of his clients’ bond portfolio allocations into money market funds or ultra-short bond funds.
“I can get a return without risk,” he said, noting ultra-short bond funds – with bonds that mature in a couple of years - are less likely to incur losses as rates rise than funds that invest in five or 10-year government notes. 
Haley will eventually reduce cash in portfolios when he sees risks subside, but he is not sure when.
RISK VERSUS COMFORT
While holding some cash is wise amid so much uncertainty, Rick Rieder, BlackRock chief investment officer of fixed income, noted that if rates are not rising and the stock market falls, 10-year Treasury notes could instead play their usual role in providing a buffer from stock losses.
If history is any indication, investors worried about bad times recover faster if they stay the course in a typical diversified portfolio. At the worst point in the bear market in March 2009, most analysts were predicting more trauma. But the stock market soared over 350 percent between then and the end of 2018, and investors who had about 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds recovered from the 2008-09 losses in about three years after the scariest point in the bear market.
Nevertheless, people often find it more comfortable to increase their cash during uncertain times. Even when the markets are not going through major gyrations, research shows cash has a powerful soothing effect on people.

Sonja Lyubomirsky, a happiness researcher and psychology professor at the University of California Riverside, along with Joe Gladstone, of University College London, surveyed British bank customers in 2016 and found that being able to see cash sitting in accounts and easily accessible gave people a feeling of comfort.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers endured their worst Christmas since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago as cautious customers forced high street stores such as John Lewis and  Debenhams  to slash prices to shift stock. 
With parliament in deadlock less than three months before Britain leaves the European Union, consumer spending is fading fast, exposing the weakness of many major retailers who are having to work ever harder to win sales and also adapt to the migration to online shopping.
Many Britons reined in their spending in November before leaving it late to shop for Christmas gifts in December. 
""This comes despite some retailers desperately attempting to generate sales through slashed pricing, which has seemingly not been enough to encourage shoppers,"" said Paul Martin, a partner at accountants KPMG. 
Trading updates released on Thursday showed that Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) suffered another quarter of falling underlying sales in both clothing and food, while department store Debenhams (L:DEB) is looking for fresh funding after its sales tumbled.
John Lewis, the employee owned biggest department store, said demand for beauty products and women's clothing had enabled it to nudge up sales but its gross profit margins remained under pressure in the ""intensely competitive pricing environment"".
""I would say that on average the promotional activity was something in the region of 20 to 30 percent higher than last year,"" Paula Nickolds, managing director of John Lewis department stores, told reporters. 
Debenhams (L:DEB) Chief Executive Sergio Bucher said the country's second biggest department store group would have to find another 80 million pounds of costs to cut in order to protect its profits after slashing prices. 
""The market in general has been very, very competitive,"" he told reporters. https://tmsnrt.rs/2H2WRhy
TESCO STANDS FIRM
 Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain biggest retailer, emerged as one of the few winners from the festive period after its own-brand basic ranges combined with premium offerings to fend off rivals at the top and bottom of the market, and keep its tills ringing.
It attracted 125,000 more shoppers to its stores this Christmas than last, with December 23 the busiest Sunday in Tesco's history. In just one hour it served 766,000 customers.
The solid performance stood in contrast to rivals Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Morrisons (L:MRW) which both missed Christmas sales forecasts this week, hit by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl. 
Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said Tesco had defied the retail gloom, but even it will need to continue to perform strongly to maintain its market rating. 
""Prospects for the UK economic environment remain nebulous, with a nervous consumer potentially looking to shop on price alone,"" he said. 
Britain's economy slowed after the 2016 Brexit referendum and looks to have lost more momentum in late 2018 as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to get parliament's support for her plan for a smooth exit from the European Union. 
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said its members reported zero year-on-year total sales growth in December, the worst performance for the month since 2008. The flat figure compared with 1.4 percent growth in December 2017.

One of the worst performers was the bicycles-to-car parts retailer Halfords (L:HFD) which cut its profit forecasts. Its shares fell 25 percent.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",German industry demands tougher EU line on China,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's influential BDI industry association has called on the European Union to adopt a tougher policy towards China and urged companies to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market as concerns mount over price dumping and technology transfer.
The tougher tone is the latest sign that policymakers and business managers in Europe are becoming increasingly worried about China as a competitor and its state-driven economic model.
In a paper presented on Thursday, the BDI stressed that German firms need China as a market, but sounded the alarm about Beijing's reluctance to open up access and made 54 demands to Berlin and Brussels to help.
""Beijing should in its own interests further open its domestic market and properly implement its long-announced economic reforms,"" BDI President Dieter Kempf said. 
The paper, first reported by Reuters in October, called for the EU to create a stronger economic framework for its own internal market to bind firms from non-market economies to its own liberal economic system.
""For the EU, it is more important than ever not only to spell out the importance of its own system and values internally but also to offensively represent them externally,"" said the BDI.
Among its demands are toughening up EU subsidy rules. Companies that don't produce goods in the EU should not be able to receive state subsidies, it argued. It also called for more EU investment in infrastructure and innovation.
As Germany's main business lobby group, the BDI's views carry weight and feed into government policy decisions.
Bilateral trade between Germany and China hit a record 187 billion euros in 2017, almost 30 percent of the total EU trade with the Asian giant. Some of the country's biggest companies, including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG), rely heavily on the rapidly-growing market.
Entitled ""Partner and Systemic Competitor - How to cope with China's state-driven economic model?"", the BDI paper stresses that China remains an important market.
""Nonetheless, it is generally sensible for the German industry to maintain diversified trade relations and make investment decisions,"" it said.
""Too much dependence on a single market always involves political and economic risks that must be minimized.""
However, not everyone agrees that taking a tougher stance against China is the best strategy. 
Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, which estimates that some 900,000 jobs in Germany depend on exports to China, cautioned against more confrontation.
""The BDI position paper on China brings another tone into the debate,"" DIHK economist Volker Treier said. ""But we always have to keep in mind that China is our most important trading partner. So every word should be weighed carefully.""
Those close ties were illustrated by Volkswagen's plan to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicle technology over the next few years, part of a $300 billion surge by global automakers with nearly half of the money targeted at China.

""The future of Volkswagen will be decided in the Chinese market,"" said Herbert Diess, chief executive of VW, which has decades-old joint ventures with two of China's largest automakers.

The yen and Treasuries ticked higher.
Stocks fell in Japan and futures pointed to lower starts in the U.S. and Europe, while Chinese equities fluctuated. The offshore yuan climbed to the strongest since August as the U.S. and China laid the ground for resolving trade issues, though S&P 500 Index contracts declined as some investors expressed disappointment at negotiations that seem likely to continue indefinitely. The dollar was steady and crude pulled back after climbing above $52 a barrel and entering a bull market.
Global stocks have rallied since the start of the year amid optimism tensions are thawing between the U.S. and China on trade and commentary from the Federal Reserve showed policy makers have shifted to a more cautious approach to further interest-rate increases. Still, concern surrounding the partial U.S. government shutdown continues to weigh on sentiment ahead of earnings season. And China inflation data on Thursday showcased slowing growth in the world’s No. 2 economy.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:57AM ET</span>",Prosecutors set to indict Nissan's Ghosn again on Friday: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors plan to indict former Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn on two more charges of financial misconduct on Friday, a person with knowledge of the issue said, bringing the total number to three.
Ghosn, who has been detained since his arrest in November, is likely to be formally charged with aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008, as well as for understating his compensation for three years through 2018.
The charges, which have been widely expected, add to an earlier charge of under-reporting his income by around half over the five years through March 2015.
At a court appearance this week, Ghosn said all accusations against him were ""meritless"" and ""unsubstantiated"".
Nissan also faces an indictment over the latest compensation reporting issue, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The Nikkei daily earlier reported that prosecutors planned to charge Ghosn for aggravated breach of trust on Friday. It also reported, citing unidentified investigation sources, that Ghosn had discussed the possibility of extending a 3 billion yen ($27.81 million) loan to a business run by a Saudi acquaintance who later provided collateral for a personal investment.
Both the Tokyo Prosecutors Office and Nissan declined to comment on the issues when contacted by Reuters.
Ghosn has been in detention since his initial arrest on Nov. 19. While he has said that he has been ""unfairly detained"", the Tokyo District Court earlier this week rejected an appeal by his lawyers to end his detention.
It is uncommon for defendants in Japan who deny charges to be granted bail ahead of trial, a practice that has drawn widespread criticism, including from Ghosn's defense team.
A member of Ghosn's Japan-based legal team told Reuters that Ghosn did not attend an interrogation session scheduled for Thursday due to a fever, and that he had been advised by a detention center physician to rest. 
Another member of the legal team told Reuters that they would apply for bail after Ghosn's current detention period ends on Friday, but that his release would come on Tuesday at the earliest should the court accept the application.

Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Motonari Otsuru, who leads Ghosn's legal team, said he expected prosecutors to take at least six months to prepare for trial.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:09AM ET</span>","Exclusive: VW, China spearhead $300 billion global drive to electrify cars","By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor
(Reuters) - Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry's transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers.
The unprecedented level of spending - much of it by Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) - is driven in large measure by government policies adopted to cut carbon dioxide emissions, and will extend technological advances that have improved battery cost, range and charging time to make electric vehicles more appealing to consumers, according to an exclusive Reuters analysis of public data released by those companies. 
For a graphic showing planned EV spending by country, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2Azl09N 
China for decades played catch-up to German, Japanese and American automakers, which dominated internal combustion vehicle technology. Now, China is positioned to lead electric vehicle development, industry executives say.
""The future of Volkswagen will be decided in the Chinese market,"" said Herbert Diess, chief executive of VW, which has decades-old joint ventures with two of China's largest automakers, SAIC Motor (SS:600104) and FAW Car (SZ:000800).
Speaking earlier this week to a small group of reporters in Beijing, Diess said China ""will become one of the automotive powerhouses in the world.""
""What we find (in China) is really the right environment to develop the next generation of cars and we find the right skills, which we only partially have in Europe or other places,"" he said. 
Diess added, ""We have very clear policies established here in China. Policymakers and regulators are requiring"" a shift to electric vehicles.
As China and other countries place more restrictions on conventional gasoline and diesel engines, auto companies have accelerated the shift to electrification. A year ago global automakers said they planned to spend $90 billion on electric vehicle development.
The $300 billion that automakers have earmarked to put electric vehicles into mass production in China, Europe and North America is greater than the economies of Egypt or Chile.
Almost one-third of the industry's EV spending total, about $91 billion, is being committed by the Volkswagen Group, which is aggressively trying to distance itself from the Dieselgate scandal, which has cost it billions in penalties and legal settlements. 
VW's sweeping electrification plan envisions capacity on three continents to build up to 15 million electric vehicles by 2025, including 50 pure electric and 30 hybrid electric models. Eventually, VW plans to offer electrified versions of all 300 models in its 12-brand global portfolio, which includes Audi and Porsche.
VW’s staggering EV budget dwarfs that of its closest competitor, Germany’s  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which has committed $42 billion. In comparison, General Motors Co (N:GM), the No 1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles.
Roughly 45 percent of the global industry's planned EV investment and procurement spending, more than $135 billion, will occur in China, which is heavily promoting the production and sale of electric vehicles through a system of government-mandated quotas, credits and incentives. 
As a result, EV spending by major Chinese automakers from SAIC to Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) could be matched or even exceeded by multinational joint-venture partners such VW, Daimler and GM, as they dramatically expand their electric vehicle portfolios in China and ramp up battery purchases from Chinese suppliers.
Reuters analyzed investment and procurement budgets made public over the past two years by 29 of the world’s top automakers, based primarily in the United States, China, Japan, Korea, India, Germany and France. The figures do not reflect planned investments and purchases that have not yet been made public.
Actual spending by vehicle manufacturers on research and development, engineering, production tooling and procurement likely will be much higher. The analysis also does not include related spending by automotive suppliers, technology companies and large corporations in other industries, from energy and aerospace to electronics and telecommunications.
“There has been a rush” to invest in electric vehicles and batteries, said Alexandre Marian, AlixPartners managing director and co-author of a 2018 study that forecast total EV spending of $255 billion through 2023 by global automakers and suppliers.
Marian said the industry has increased spending budgets on electric vehicles and batteries, while seeking more alliances and partnerships to help spread the higher investment costs.
Alliances, such as those between VW and its Chinese partners, will be among the greatest spurs to innovation, especially in the global rollout of electric vehicles.

CEO Diess said VW is ""evolving from the model where we have been developing and bringing European technology into this market to a new phase where we will co-develop part of the automotive technology in China for the rest of the world. I think this is a significant step change.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India's cash-strapped Jet Airways (NS:JET) proposed to creditors that it would catch up with debt payments in arrears by September and from April would meet debt payments as they come due, according to a document seen by Reuters.
Jet met with lenders, lessors and vendors in India on Tuesday to discuss its financial situation and a debt-repayment plan, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Jet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The airline has to make large debt repayments over the next few years, starting with about 17 billion rupees ($242 million) by the end of March, ratings agency ICRA said in a note on Jan. 2.
The airline last week said it had defaulted on a debt payment to a consortium of Indian banks, led by State Bank of India, that had been due on Dec. 31, prompting ICRA to downgrade the carrier's credit ratings and sent its shares sharply lower.
The 25-year-old airline also owes money to pilots, lessors and vendors. Intense pricing competition, a weak rupee and rising fuel costs weighed on Indian airlines in 2018.
An installment of interest and principal on debt due on Dec. 31 was delayed ""due to temporary cash flow mismatch"", the company said last week, without disclosing the size of the missed payment.
In a presentation slide from the meeting with lenders on Tuesday seen by Reuters, Jet proposed a ""resolution plan"" that would involve making payments on loans originally due in December, January and February in several tranches between Mar. 31 and Sept. 30.
""The management is taking every effort to ensure that the arrears accumulated until now do not grow,"" the slide said. ""Jet Airways shall be current on its payments for services beyond 01-Apr-2019.""
Mint daily on Wednesday reported that the airline's lenders proposed a $900 million resolution plan at the meeting on Tuesday.

The controlling shareholder and chairman of Jet Airways, Naresh Goyal, and major shareholder Etihad Airways are likely to jointly inject $450 million into the carrier, while Indian lenders will restructure another $450 million of debt, Mint quoted sources as saying.

According to a list from China's broadcasting watchdog - the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television - 84 new video games have been approved. 
This is the second such list in a fortnight after the body gave its nod to 80 video games in late December.
Despite the thaw in approvals, the biggest two players in the market, Tencent and domestic rival NetEase Inc, did not appear to have any games on either list.
The freeze on new approvals had spooked companies in the world's largest gaming market, where an estimated 620 million players spent $37.9 billion last year, mostly on mobile and PC games, according to gaming market research firm Newzoo.
China stopped approving new titles from March 2018 amid a regulatory overhaul triggered by growing criticism of video games for being violent and leading to myopia as well as addiction among young users.
Tencent in December had said that signs of a thaw in gaming approvals were ""clearly exciting news"" for the country's gaming industry and that the firm would look to ensure the content of its games complied with regulations.
The Hong Kong-listed company's shares took a major knock last year, in part because of concern over the gaming approvals freeze, wiping billions of dollars off its market value.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) will pay more than $700 million to resolve lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department and diesel owners over claims it used illegal software to allow 104,000 diesel vehicles to emit excess emissions, three people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.
Fiat Chrysler will pay $311 million in civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, about $75 million to states investigating the excess emissions and additional funds to offset excess emissions from the older cars. It will also pay $280 million to settle a lawsuit by owners, the sources said.
Fiat Chrysler has denied any wrongdoing and previously said there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. In October, the company set aside 713 million euros ($815 million) to cover potential costs related to the case.
Separately, Robert Bosch GmbH (ROBG.UL), a German auto supplier that made some components for the Fiat Chrysler diesel engines, is expected to announce it will settle suits from U.S. owners for $30 million, one person said.
The settlements are set to be announced on Thursday at the Justice Department. Fiat Chrysler, Bosch and the Justice Department declined to comment.
The Environmental Protection Agency issued a media advisory Wednesday that said it would make an ""announcement of a significant civil action to address cheating on federal auto-emissions tests.""
The Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May 2017, accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles from the 2014-2016 model years.
Fiat Chrysler won approval from U.S. regulators in July 2017 to sell diesel vehicles with updated software. The company has repeatedly said it hoped to use that software to address agencies' concerns over the 2014-2016 vehicles. 
The company is not expected to make any hardware changes to the vehicles and the fix will not impact the vehicle's fuel economy, two people said.
Owners of those vehicles are expected to get an average of $2,800 each for completing the software updates, the sources said. Fiat Chrysler will formally issue an emissions recall for the vehicles, but will not offer to buy back the vehicles, the sources said.
The Justice Department in 2017 said Fiat Chrysler used auxiliary emissions controls in diesel vehicles that led to ""substantially"" higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide, or NOx pollution, which is linked to smog formation and respiratory problems.
U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards.
VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. Regulators have also been probing diesel emissions in  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) U.S. Mercedes Benz vehicles. 
VW also paid $4.3 billion in 2017 in U.S. civil and criminal fines and pleaded guilty to three criminal felony counts to resolve the Justice Department's investigation.
Fiat Chrysler still faces an ongoing criminal investigation by the Justice Department.

Fiat Chrysler sells two U.S. diesel models and plans to add two new Jeep SUV diesel models by 2020.

1374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Traders Expect Vietnam Stocks to Jump 18% This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Optimism for Vietnam’s stock market was running high at the start of 2018, before a rout erased all early gains. This year again, investors are confident.
The benchmark VN Index could rise to 1,049 by the end of December, implying an 18 percent advance for 2019, according to the average estimate of nine analysts, investors and strategists compiled by Bloomberg News. In February of last year, market watchers expected the gauge to jump 23 percent for all of 2018, a survey showed at the time -- it ended up sinking 9.3 percent.
“Our view on the outlook for the economy and stock market of Vietnam is positive through 2019, with the domestic picture particularly strong relative to regional and developmental peers,” said Lawrence Brader, the co-portfolio manager of the PXP Vietnam Smaller Companies Fund in Ho Chi Minh City. His firm, PXP Vietnam Asset Management, oversaw $110 million in assets as of November.
Brader expects the nation’s benchmark to surpass its 2018 high and sees “a fair chance of the index doubling from here in the next three to five years.” The gauge hit a record of 1,204 in April, and rising above that level would mean an advance of more than 35 percent for 2019.
Some of the factors analysts are citing for their optimism are:
While the VN Index December estimate is bullish, it’s nothing compared with last year’s: the 1,049 average projection is 13 percent below the 2018 high. And how can investors be blamed after they got burned so badly?
After six years of the VN Index rising more than 6 percent annually -- including a 48 percent surge in 2017 -- 2018 started on a bright note. By early April, the gauge was up 22 percent for the year, before everything unraveled as it entered a bear market in May. Federal Reserve tightening triggered a surge in the U.S. dollar, just as concerns grew over the consequences of the U.S.-China trade friction.
Risks this year will be mostly external, with the trade war between the U.S. and China a point of focus, analysts said. A slowing global economy and a rebound in oil prices are other perils cited for Vietnam.
“There are a bunch of uncertainties out there,” said Michel Tosto, the head of institutional sales and brokerage at Viet Capital Securities in Ho Chi Minh City. “We expect activities of both local and foreign investors will be more muted. Investors will look for diversification, and investing in both stocks and bonds is not a bad idea.”
While the nation’s economic expansion will be slower -- it’s expected to be 6.6 percent, down from 7.1 percent in 2018 -- he says foreign direct investments will remain strong and the local currency will keep outperforming most of its peers in 2019.
Here are the year-end targets from some firms:
And further comments from market watchers:
Lawrence Brader, co-portfolio manager of the PXP Vietnam Smaller Companies Fund in Ho Chi Minh City:
“The market remains relatively cheap outside of a number of index heavyweights, and we continue to find both value and growth opportunities across a number of sectors. The opportunity to add to equity holdings with a strong outlook for earnings growth at reasonable valuations is apparent.”
Bernard Lapointe, head of research at Viet Dragon Securities in Ho Chi Minh City:
“The VN Index will stay in a fairly tight range between 900 to 1,000. I put a 70 probability on that. A move below or above these levels will depend on the geopolitics and macro headwinds that we are facing or may face.
“The biggest issues for the VN Index are external. Domestically, EPS growth is fine, although we have reduced our growth outlook in general. The dong has stabilized, and the central bank is doing a good job of managing inflation expectations.”
Shamoon Tariq, vice chief investment officer at Tundra Fonder, which helps oversee $350 million in assets:
“We have seen emerging and frontier markets getting roiled in 2018, mainly due to increasing Fed rates in the U.S., strong dollar and uncertainty over the US-China trade war. That has brought valuations in Vietnam to attractive levels.
“We keep adding into Vietnam’s structural growth stories, where we see earnings growth sustainable in coming years and cheap valuations. We are assessing the geopolitical situation in Vietnam’s context but have a positive stance for Vietnam overall.”

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 11:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears chairman submits new roughly $5 billion bid to save retailer - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert submitted a revised roughly $5 billion takeover bid for the company on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said, boosting the chances that the U.S. department store operator will escape liquidation.
In a concession, Lampert agreed to assume tax and vendor bills Sears has incurred since filing for bankruptcy protection in October, the sources said. The billionaire's revised bid was submitted through an affiliate of his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, on Wednesday afternoon along with a $120 million deposit, the sources added. 
Lampert's previous bid, which Sears had rejected, was valued at $4.4 billion.
The new bid, which Sears will consider during a Jan. 14 bankruptcy auction, proposes assuming up to about $300 million of tax and merchandise expenses the 126-year-old company has racked up since its Oct. 15 bankruptcy filing, the sources said.
The offer, which aims to preserve up to 50,000 jobs, also would assume up to roughly $350 million in additional Sears bankruptcy expenses, severance benefits for employees and other liabilities, one of the sources added. Sears employed about 68,000 people when it filed for bankruptcy. 
Ensuring Sears can pay its expenses, which include bills for legal and financial advisers and are known as administrative claims, was a main point of contention as the company negotiated the deal with Lampert. 
Lampert's previous bid had proposed acquiring 425 Sears stores. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the details of Lampert's new bid are not yet public. 
Sears and ESL declined to comment.
Lampert's revised bid is the only one that envisions keeping Sears alive, albeit in a smaller form, and came after a last-minute deal he reached with the retailer on Tuesday as the company was preparing to liquidate. Other offers submitted over the past several weeks were for pieces of Sears or liquidation proposals to close its doors. 
The breakthrough occurred hours before a scheduled bankruptcy court hearing on Tuesday. A Sears lawyer disclosed the agreement during the hearing, telling a judge it materialized after what he described as round-the-clock negotiations. 
The agreement required Lampert to make a $120 million deposit, more than $17 million of which he will forfeit to Sears creditors unless his bid prevails in next week's bankruptcy auction. 
Sears will now weigh Lampert's offer against a liquidation that would shut down the retail chain for good and put tens of thousands of people out of work. Sears has lined up a liquidator to sell off the chain's vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures if necessary. 
Sears dates back to the late 1800s and eventually became known for its mail-order catalogs. By the 1960s, it was the largest retailer in the world and a fixture in malls across the United States, selling everything from appliances to auto parts to toys. 
But the retailer failed to adapt to the modern era of online shopping and was overtaken by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which earlier this week became the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of close to $800 billion. 
Sears in October became the latest retailer to be swept up in a wave of bankruptcies amid the modern competitive landscape and is now trying to avoid the fate of other chains that failed to survive their court filings. Toys 'R' Us Inc and Bon-Ton Stores Inc were unable to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and forced to liquidate last year.
Lampert formed the modern Sears through an $11 billion merger in 2005 that combined Sears Roebuck and Kmart. He envisioned returning the retailer to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world, a radio station and Allstate (NYSE:ALL) insurance. 
Critics, including some Sears creditors, contend he let Sears deteriorate even as he invested in the retailer and loaned it money. 
Lampert's current bid for Sears still faces hurdles that have been tabled for now but could eventually threaten his attempt to acquire the chain.
His previous offers requested a legal release that would clear him from exposure to litigation over transactions he engaged in with Sears before it filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Unsecured creditors, including landlords and bondholders, have argued there are viable claims against Lampert regarding the deals, which Lampert maintains were proper. The transactions helped him become the company's largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder. 
Lampert has also proposed forgiving $1.3 billion of debt he holds in exchange for ownership of a restructured Sears, a bankruptcy maneuver known as a credit bid. Unsecured creditors have previously argued the move should not be allowed. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain plans to review the credit bid after next week's auction.

1376,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Index Futures Fall as China Trade Talks Disappoint,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock index futures slipped in Asia after a statement on China trade talks disappointed some investors and lawmakers in Washington remained gridlocked over a resolution on a partial government shutdown.
Contracts on S&P 500 e-minis expiring March slid as much as 0.7 percent. The underlying gauge pared gains on Wednesday as the spending impasse extended into its 19th day. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.
China and the U.S. wrapped up three-days of mid-level talks on Wednesday with Washington pressing for a way to make sure Beijing delivers on commitments made in any deal. For its part, China said the meetings were “extensive, in-depth and detailed,” and laid the foundation for a resolution of the conflict. Statements from both sides made no mention of the next round of tariffs to be implemented by March.
“Investors are still nervous about all this,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. “There had been a rally earlier in the week after President Trump tweeted that trade talks were going very well. This statement is probably not as upbeat as that tweet was.”
The S&P 500 Index has climbed 5.6 percent in the past four sessions, it’s longest winning streak in four months after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a more dovish stance and expectations of a positive outcome from the trade talks. The index has rallied 10 percent since hitting the brink of a bear market on Christmas Eve.
“Technically we’re at a point where you could have a bit of a consolidation or maybe even a bit of a pullback,” Sydney-based Oliver said. “When you get close to that 50-day moving average you might expect the market to have a bit of a pause after bouncing from oversold levels.”
Investors are also nervous the impact of the partial government shutdown that’s set to become its longest after Trump stormed out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders calling it a “waste of time.” Trump blamed Democrats for refusing to consider funding for a border wall while House Speaker Nanci Pelosi called Trump “petulant” and his approach to the talks “pathetic” as they sought to re-open the government.
Markets should be preparing for the shutdown to impact American growth as Trump and the Democrats play a game of chicken, said Patrick Chovanec, managing director and chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Group LLC. Both sides are fighting over a symbol that neither wants to compromise over, he said.
“Markets have gone through this so many times with these shutdowns that last like a week or whatever and at the end of the day, they realize it didn’t have any impact on GDP,” Chovanec, who was head of internal communications for House Republicans during the 1995 shutdowns, said. “But by Friday it’ll be the longest government shutdown that there’s been, and then you’re going to talk about a real economic cost.”
Read more on the impact already being felt from the government shutdown
The impact is starting to be felt. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc.’s initial public offerings, likely the two largest this year, have been left in limbo as the Securities and Exchange Commission is sapped of resources. Airports are girding for disruptions as security screeners call in sick in growing numbers and federal contractors face more than $200 million a day in lost or delayed revenue. About 800,000 federal workers will not receive paychecks on Friday.
“Real pain is going to start to be felt” when workers miss their paycheck and there’s disruptions to air travel, Chovanec said. If people aren’t paid and that money isn’t circulating, “that starts to have an economic impact.”

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",China's 'flash boys' hedge funds eye end to hiatus,"By Noah Sin and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's data-driven ""flash boys"" - hedge fund managers who for years have been handicapped by government curbs on tools to short-sell stocks - are dusting off high-speed trading products as Beijing revives the country's financial derivatives market.
China's financial futures exchange last month relaxed trading rules on stock index futures and vowed to boost liquidity of that market, while the country's two largest stock exchanges said they aimed to launch new stock index option products this year.
That is music to the ears of a breed of fund managers nicknamed ""flash boys"", whose quantitative strategies rely on historical data, algorithms and derivatives to profit from short-term price movements, sometimes within a second.
Such techniques differ from conventional strategies, in which portfolio managers make bets based on their views of a company or market.
""The widespread usage of derivatives will make returns more stable ... increase liquidity, and new strategies may emerge,"" said Wang Feng, a former Wall Street trader and co-founder of Alpha Squared Capital, a Hangzhou-based hedge fund. ""The industry will enter era 2.0. The most difficult time may have passed already.""
LEAN YEARS
Derivatives could be deployed to insure against unexpected losses or simply to bet on shares to fall, a so-called short strategy. The latter function was blamed for exacerbating the equity rout of 2015 and 2016, leading to more stringent rules. That led to poorer liquidity in such instruments and ultimately higher costs for hedge funds, sharply reducing their popularity.
Shen Yi, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trader who set up his own fund house in Shanghai, saw his assets under management halve from a pinnacle of $1.6 billion around 2015 as government curbs on index futures trading bit.
""In the last two years, you see quant funds shrink and shrink and shrink,"" he said. But with the rule relaxation, ""I would say we will go back to the peak time very soon"".
A liquid derivatives market is particularly essential to many quantitative trading strategies. In ""market neutral"" strategies, for instance, investors match long and short positions in different stocks, seeking to profit from stock selections while maintaining constant, steady returns regardless of whether the overall market is rising or falling.
In China, where shorting individual stocks is highly restricted, hedge funds instead use stock index futures to build short positions.
""The next two to three years will be a bull market for quant funds. We're getting ready for that,"" said Chen Bin, founding partner of quant fund manager SHQX Asset Management in Shanghai, who increased headcount by a quarter last year to 40 in expectation of business expansion.
The derivatives defrost is good news even for mutual fund managers, who typically focus on long-only products that bet on rising prices.
""A broadened derivatives market gives fund companies more choices in designing fund products,"" said, Fang Weili, deputy CEO of Huatai-PineBridge Investments in Shanghai.

WELCOME CHANGE
There were 8,966 private securities investment fund managers in China as of November 2018, commanding 2.26 trillion yuan ($331.05 billion), according to data published by the Asset Management Association of China.
Amid the Sino-U.S. trade war and softer domestic economic growth, the Chinese stock market shed a quarter of its value last year.
Due to excessive hedging costs, many hedge funds were forced to diversify into long-only quant strategies, which gave them little shield against the market downturn.
Without adequate protection, these funds' ability to deliver positive returns regardless of the wider market's performance - a key selling point for flash boys' clients - was sharply weakened.
Market neutral strategies achieved annualized returns of just 0.6 percent on average since regulators introduced harsh curbs on index futures trading in late 2015, compared with roughly 10 percent in the previous four years, according to an index compiled by fund distributor Shenzhen Qianhai Simuwang. 
But the industry sensed hope as regulators stuck to derivatives liberalization throughout 2018 despite slumping share prices, in stark contrast to their response in 2016. Officials started talking up a derivatives reboot when the stock market was in better shape in 2017.
Underscoring authorities' changing attitude toward derivatives' role in market downturns, the securities regulator made the rare move in November of exonerating three brokerages previously accused of funding short-selling activities during the 2015 market crash.)
Over the past year, China also allowed high-profile global hedge funds such as Bridgewater Associates, Man Group and Winton Capital to operate in China's capital markets, where foreign participants are predominately traditional, long-only players.
Shen applauded the moves, relieved that index futures were no longer the scapegoat for market slumps. ""Now we find another guy to blame, it's Donald Trump,"" he said.
For the flash boys to fully blossom again, however, regulators will need to do more.
First, there is the issue of cutting ""relatively high"" administrative fees for trading index futures, said Alpha Squared Capital's Wang, who expects such reforms to take time.
More broadly, fund managers would be more comfortable in applying short strategies if they did not have to worry about regulatory consequences, said Josh Gu, Chengdu-based director of quant research at the industry tracker HFR.
""Short trading (could be) very costly when your career is also at stake,"" he said.

China’s producer inflation data was in focus as it rose less than expected for the month of December.
The Producer Price Index in December, which measures price increases before they reach the consumer, was up 0.9% from a year ago, lower than the expected 1.6%, official data showed.
The Consumer Price Index, a gauge of prices for goods and services, rose 1.9% year on year in December, compared to 2.2% in November.
The data was ""consistent with evidence elsewhere of cooling domestic demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
The impact of the data were limited on Chinese stocks, as the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.2% and 0.5% respectively in morning trade.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 0.4%.
Meanwhile, China’s Commerce Ministry said in a Thursday morning statement the trade talks with the U.S. that ended yesterday were extensive and detailed, and that both sides agreed to continue to keep in close contact.
The U.S. side also issued a statement earlier in the day. According to the report, China had pledged to purchase ""a substantial amount of agricultural, energy, manufactured goods, and other products and services from the United States.”
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.3%. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he expects the Japanese economy to continue expanding moderately.

1380,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",FOMC Minutes- Did Markets Misread Powell's Post-Fed Comments,"It is clear from the minutes from the December FOMC meeting that the Fed was apprehensive in raising rates and expected to pause its tightening cycle in lieu of additional data. The market may have misread Chair Powell’s comments and overreacted notes Matt Weller.
The minutes from each Federal Reserve meeting are released three weeks after the meeting is held, meaning that they’re generally stale under the best of circumstances.
That sentiment is especially true this time around following the massive outbreak of volatility around the holiday period, when the S&P 500 fell 8% in the four days following the Fed’s December meeting— only to rally back 10% off those lows as of writing. In the interim, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell walked back his post-meeting comments, noting that the central bank will be “patient” in its approach to monetary policy, that there is “no preset path for raising rates” or adjusting the balance sheet, and that he was “listening very carefully” to markets.
Despite that disclaimer, today’s FOMC minutes still contained some valuable nuggets about the central bank’s plans heading into 2019 and beyond. Below are the major headlines from the minutes (emphasis mine):

MANY FED POLICYMAKERS SAID FED COULD AFFORD TO BE PATIENT ABOUT FURTHER POLICY TIGHTENING GIVEN MUTED INFLATION PRESSURES


A FEW OFFICIALS FAVORED NO RATE INCREASE AT DECEMBER MEETING


FED OFFICIALS SAW EXTENT, TIMING OF FUTURE HIKES AS LESS CLEAR


SOME OFFICIALS NOTED DOWNSIDE RISKS MAY HAVE INCREASED


FED DISCUSSED RESERVES OPTIONS INCLUDING INTEREST ON EXCESS RESERVES (IOER), REDEMPTION PACE

In essence, the central bank is suggesting that monetary policy will be increasingly flexible and “data dependent” moving forward, in contrast to the relatively formulaic one-hike-per-quarter pace that we saw through 2018. Furthermore, the discussion around IOER and redemption pace suggests that the balance sheet wind down is not on autopilot, as many traders feared.
Given the tone of these minutes and recent policymaker comments, we can conclude that markets interpreted Powell’s post-meeting press conference incorrectly; in other words, the “Powell Put” may still be in force, with the central bank remaining hyper conscious of market volatility when setting policy. The market tail continues to wag the Fed dog.
As of writing, the CME’s FedWatch tool shows that traders are pricing in an 85% chance that interest rates remain at or below current levels through the entire year, so the central bank (and the U.S. economy more broadly) has plenty of work to do if we’re going to see much in the way of interest rate increases this year.
Market Reaction
Risk appetite saw a slight boost following the release of the minutes, with major U.S. stock indices now trading back above pre-Fed-meeting levels. The S&P 500 is now testing a key level of previous-support-turned-resistance at 2600, which could determine whether the next 100 points are to the upside or downside heading into Q4 earnings season.

Bed Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from bath towels and bed sheets to kitchen appliances and home furnishings, has been heavily investing in revamping its stores and digital platforms as well as its loyalty programs to ward off online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Wayfair Inc  (N:W).
The company has also been spending on its decorative furnishing business, adding more assortments to its store and websites while developing its own brands that will be introduced over the next two years.
And the efforts seems to be paying off, with the retailer saying it is ahead of plans on its long-term goals of slowing down its declining operating profit and net earnings per share in fiscal 2018 and 2019 and growing them in 2020.
""As we are moving forward in 2019, we expect these initiatives to gain even more momentum and accelerate,"" Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares said on a conference call with analysts.
The retailer forecast 2019 earnings per share to be about the same as fiscal 2018 at $2 per share, above analysts' estimate of a profit of $1.57 per share.
""The company has shifted back ... focus on profit over sales. Whether this pays off longer-term remains to be seen,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said.
The Union, New Jersey-based company's net income fell 60 percent to $24.4 million, or 18 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Dec. 1.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 17 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales rose to $3.03 billion from $2.95 billion.
However, total comparable sales dropped 1.8 percent, continuing their slide for the seventh straight quarter. Analysts had expected comparable sales to fall 0.29 percent.

The ""Buy Buy Baby"" brand owner's shares, which had nearly halved in 2018, were up 16.3 percent at $14.26 in after-hours trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) called on the British government to avoid a disorderly Brexit and said it was building up some stock, expanding warehouse capacity and training suppliers for customs changes in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal. 
Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe's biggest trading bloc in under 80 days but a Brexit agreement looks set to be voted down by lawmakers next week, making a no-deal and potential trade barriers more likely.
The BMW-owned (DE:BMWG) brand, which reported record 2018 sales, said that despite the steps it was taking to prepare for Brexit, it was impossible to predict what would happen if there is not a managed transition after March 29.
""We are highly dependent on a proper, working frictionless chain of goods and this whole company hinges on just-in-time deliveries,"" Chief Executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told reporters. 
""We urge the government to avoid any hard Brexit,"" he said. 
Asked whether Rolls-Royce, which builds all of its roughly 4,000 cars per year at its Goodwood factory in southern England, would ever make some models overseas, Mueller-Oetvoes said:
""This is a no-go,"" he said. ""Rolls-Royce belongs to Britain, we are committed to Britain.""
Sales at the 115-year-old company, which employs just over 2,000 people, rose 22 percent to 4,107 cars last year, boosted by an over 40 percent rise in demand from China, which accounted for one in five purchases.
The numbers reflect similarly buoyant sentiment from Aston Martin, suggesting that luxury automakers might buck an apparent slowdown that has hit the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and prompted China's most successful car firm Geely to forecast flat sales this year.
""You see more and more self-drivers in the Chinese market, people being behind the wheel particularly over the weekends in the luxury sector ... and that made (models) Wraith and Dawn quite successful in China last year,"" he said.
""I can't comment yet on how 2019 will pan out for us in China but so far we haven't seen dents in our success over there.""
Mueller-Oetvoes also said that tax cuts made by U.S. President Donald Trump also helped the business.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials used three days of trade talks in Beijing to demand more details on China's pledge to make big purchases of American goods, as well as to push for ways to hold China to any commitments on changes to industrial policies.
The meetings in China were the first face-to-face negotiations since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Buenos Aires in December and agreed a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.
Washington has presented Beijing with a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. They include changes to China's policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other non-tariff barriers to trade.
Some 40 days into the 90-day truce, there were few concrete details on progress made so far. The meetings in Beijing were not at a ministerial level, so were not expected to produce a deal to end the trade war.
U.S. and Chinese officials discussed ""ways to achieve fairness, reciprocity and balance in trade relations,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said in a statement.
""The talks also focused on China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of agricultural, energy, manufactured, and other products and services from the United States,"" the USTR said.
China made that pledge after the Xi-Trump meeting in Buenos Aires, when U.S. officials said China would start buying immediately. But aside from some soybean purchases, there has been little sign of big-ticket acquisitions.
In December, top Trump administration officials had said the trade commitments amounted to $1.2 trillion, but did not specify the composition or time period.
Those purchases would help meet another key demand from Trump: that China take action to reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit with its biggest economic rival.
Big spending on commodities and goods would send a positive signal on China's intent to work with the United States, but would do nothing to resolve the U.S. demands that require difficult structural change from China.
It is unclear how much progress on those issues negotiators can make in 90 days, nor how much progress Trump would want to see to stop him from further escalating the trade war. The issues at play have soured the wider U.S.-China relationship for years.
At stake are scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion in Chinese imports. Trump has said he would increase those duties to 25 percent from 10 percent currently if no deal is reached by March 2, and has threatened to tax all imports from China if Beijing fails to cede to U.S. demands.
Beijing has said it will not give up ground on issues it conceives as core. China will not make any ""unreasonable concessions"" and any agreement must involve compromise on both sides, the China Daily, a state newspaper, said on Wednesday. 
The paper said in an editorial that the dispute harms both countries and disrupts the international trade order and supply chains. 
NOTHING IN THE DIARY
No schedule for further face-to-face negotiations was released after the talks, and USTR said the American delegation was returning to Washington to report on the meetings and ""to receive guidance on the next steps,"" USTR said.
One of the biggest challenges to any deal would be to ensure that China enforces whatever is agreed to stop technology transfers, intellectual property theft and hacking of U.S. computer networks.
The USTR said officials broached those topics and discussed the need for any agreement to include ""complete implementation subject to ongoing verification and effective enforcement.""
U.S. officials have long complained that China has failed to live up to trade promises, often citing Beijing's pledges to resume imports of American beef that took more than a decade to implement.
Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, said there was still time for a deal to be struck, but it will largely be based on American acceptance of Chinese promises for changes to its economic model, with little evidence of action.
""What really matters here is what enforcements will the U.S. have when the Chinese don't follow through,"" Scissors said, adding that this would need to entail a threat to reimpose tariffs by a certain date.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox Business Network the administration expects the ongoing negotiations to prove fruitful and that the administration's complaints about Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property were ""top of mind"" in the negotiations with Beijing.
Stocks rallied globally on the positive tone of the talks and optimism that Washington and Beijing can avert an all-out trade war. [MKTS/GLOB]
Companies in both the United States and China are feeling the pain from the effects of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rattled global markets last week when it cut its sales outlook, blaming weak demand in China.
China's Commerce Ministry, the lead agency on its side of the table, was silent after the conclusion of the talks, but was expected to address outcomes at its regular weekly news briefing on Thursday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, speaking to reporters before the talks ended, confirmed that talks were extended for an unscheduled third day, saying this ""shows that the two sides were indeed very serious in conducting the consultations.""
Speaking after the conclusion of the talks, Ted McKinney, the U.S. under secretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, told reporters in Beijing that he thought they ""went just fine."" He added: ""It's been a good one for us.""
TARIFF REMOVAL
The U.S. China Business Council, a group representing American companies doing business in China, applauded the ""substantive discussions"" over the past three days, but urged the two governments to make tangible progress on achieving equal treatment of foreign companies in China and changes to policies aimed at technology transfer.
The group also urged the removal of U.S. tariffs when China delivers on its promises.

""Removal of these tariffs must be a priority, to address the damage that has been done to American companies that depend on trade with China, and to the U.S. economy as a whole,"" the group said.

Lasseter, regarded as a modern day Walt Disney because of his creativity and commercial success, left Disney late last year. His exit followed a six-month leave of absence after what he called ""missteps,"" including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable.
""... We did not enter into this decision lightly. John has acknowledged and apologized for his mistakes and, during the past year away from the workplace, has endeavored to address and reform them."" Skydance Chief Executive Officer David Ellison said in a statement.
In a memo to staff, Ellison said, Skydance employed outside counsel to thoroughly investigate the allegations, which the company considered serious and warranted its full attention.
However, advocacy groups expressed disappointment at the CEO's comments.
""By saying Skydance has conducted an independent investigation and then proceeded to hire Lasseter, do they mean to suggest that they are hiring him in spite of the numerous accounts of women and colleagues?"" Women In Film, Los Angeles said in a statement.
Hollywood anti-harassment organization Time's Up in a Twitter post https://twitter.com/TIMESUPNOW/status/1083100684151545856 said, ""Skydance Media's decision to hire John Lasseter as head of animation endorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence.""
Lasseter directed the 1995 hit ""Toy Story"" and was the creative force behind movie hits like ""Frozen"" and ""Finding Nemo"".

Lasseter, who will report to Ellison, will be based in Los Angeles and start later this month.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce,"By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, and his wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the couple said on Twitter on Wednesday. 
Jeff Bezos, 54, has a fortune that has soared as high as $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, which again became Wall Street's most valuable company this week, surpassing  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Bezos has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon, an online bookseller that grew into the world's largest internet retailer.
MacKenzie Bezos, a Princeton graduate who is now a novelist, did accounting for Amazon for its first year after it was founded in 1994. 
The couple decided to divorce after a long period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation, and expect to remain partners in ventures and projects, according to the joint statement.
Amazon shares ended up 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.
According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion. Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion.
Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another. 
“They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,” she said. “I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.""
Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares.
""If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,” she said.
It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump.
""These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,” Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.
Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce. 
""Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon,"" said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.
MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.
The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children.
Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon.
""When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,"" he said.
Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth. 
Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.
In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there. 
From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. 
In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.
Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.

He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.

The Tokyo District Court has rejected a request by Ghosn's lawyers to end his detention following his Nov. 19 arrest on accusations of financial misconduct, Jiji Press reported on Wednesday.
Without citing its sources, Liberation reported that Ghosn had had his tax domicile in France until 2012 and was subject to the country's wealth tax. 
Ghosn then moved his tax domicile to the Netherlands, where the holding company for the Renault-Nissan alliance is incorporated and which does not have a wealth tax, the daily said.
Liberation said French fiscal authorities declined to comment on Ghosn's case as it was a ""tax secret"", as is their policy on individuals' tax situations.

In his first public appearance since his arrest, Ghosn told a Tokyo court on Tuesday that he had been wrongly accused of financial conduct. Ghosn has been formally charged with under-reporting his income.

1. Powell Speaks and the Markets Will Listen
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak tomorrow and investors will be looking at every word.
It only took one word -- “patient” -- at Powell’s last public appearance to send the market soaring.
Powell will speak at an event at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. The lunch and program portion is scheduled to start at 12:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT), but the Federal Reserve says Powell’s remarks will likely start around 12:45 PM.
Bulls will be hoping for more of the same from a kinder, gentler Powell, who said the FOMC is prepared to wait on interest rate hikes, depending on economic data, and could also alter its balance sheet plans as needed.
Currently the markets are pricing in the Fed keeping rates steady through its October meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Also on the Fed calendar, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will speak at the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce on “Ensuring Long-Term Growth” at 8:35 AM ET.
And St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will give a speech on monetary policy at the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce at 12:30 PM ET.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published today, Bullard said the FOMC is bordering on going too far with rate hikes and could push the economy into a recession.
2. Jobless Claims Expected to Dip
Labor market data continue to arrive despite the partial shutdown of the federal government.
Weekly initial jobless claims will be released tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) and may have an outsized impact on trading given the dearth of other numbers.
On average, economists expect that claims for first-time unemployment benefits dropped slightly to 225,000.
The Labor Department reported a gain in December nonfarm payrolls last week that beat expectations by a wide margin, while the latest JOLTS report showed job openings fell in November.
3. Energy Sector Looks for Oil Rally to Continue
The broader stock market is suddenly getting a lift from a beaten-down sector, as energy stocks follow oil prices higher.
The bulls look to be back in control of crude, which jumped 5% today, shrugging a smaller than expected drawdown in U.S. oil inventories and a large buildup in products.
If optimism that U.S. and China trade talks are headed to a resolution continues, energy could be a bulwark for January.
But analysts expressed skepticism.
""The products build is crazy,"" Tariq Zahir of the oil-focused Tyche Capital Advisors in New York said.
""This rally over the last several days is beyond its last legs in my opinion,"" added Zahir, who typically has a bearish outlook on crude."

1408,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Extends Rally as Fed's Minutes Signal Slower Hikes,"Investing.com - Wall Street rallied on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes reaffirmed investor expectations that the central bank will likely rein in rate hikes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied for a fourth-straight day and closed 0.39% higher. The S&P 500 added 0.41%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.87%.
A sea of green washed over Wall Street on receding worries the Fed may overshoot on policy, after the minutes from the December meeting showed the central bank was willing to ""be patient about further policy firming.""
The Fed's somewhat dovish outlook was driven by the ""volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth,"" the minutes showed.
Beyond the Fed, the market was supported by rising energy stocks as oil prices soared after Saudi Arabia confirmed it would continue to cut output, while optimism on U.S. and China trade also lifted sentiment.
U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted McKinney said he thought the recent round of trade talks “went just fine.”
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), widely viewed as bellwethers for trade given their large international exposure, ended the day higher, supporting industrials and the broader market.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country, and many hope the recent talks could lead to a deal, or at the very least stave off the threat of further escalation.
The 90-day trade-war truce is due to end March 1, when President Donald Trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and raise duties on imports from China to 25% from 10%.
Tech also played a role in the rally as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shrugged off a report of iPhone production cuts.
Apple is trimming its current production plans for new iPhones by about 10% for the next three months, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday.
The bearish report arrived a day after CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that market participants should pay more attention to the tech giant's growing revenue from services and wearables.
A surge in homebuilder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), meanwhile, supported a rally in homebuilders, even as the company reported mixed quarterly results, with management bullish on the earnings call..
Lennar rallied 8% as the company reported earnings of $1.96 a share, a penny above consensus on Capital IQ. Revenue jumped 71% to $6.46 billion, but narrowly missed analysts' estimates for $6.55 billion.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) added to strong gains in the session, rising sharply in after-market hours as its fourth-quarter earnings topped consensus estimates. 
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Lennar (NYSE:LEN) up 7.9%, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), up 7.1%, and DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), up 6.3%, were among the best S&P 500 performers of the session.
Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), down 12.4%, Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), down 5.1%, and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), down 3.7%, were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Wall Street extends rally as chipmakers rebound,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street rallied for a fourth session on Wednesday, propelled by Apple, chipmakers and other trade-sensitive stocks after signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and China.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX), now in its longest daily winning streak in nearly four months, is up about 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, lifted by hopes for a deal between the world's two largest economies, which eased some worries over the impact of the trade spat on global growth. 
Market participants were also encouraged by strong U.S. jobs data and recent indications the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates. 
The Fed released minutes showing a range of policymakers said in December they could be patient about future interest rate increases and that a few did not support the central bank's rate increase that month.
China pledged to purchase ""a substantial amount"" of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said, as talks wrapped up in Beijing.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) rose 1.50 percent, with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) up 1.70 percent despite a Nikkei report that the company had reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models for the January-March quarter.
The company's shares tumbled about 10 percent last week after it warned on holiday quarter sales. Its suppliers, which largely include chipmakers, took another beating on Tuesday after Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) flagged weak chip demand.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) gained 2.52 percent. Chipmakers are among the U.S. multinationals with the highest revenue exposure to China.
""If you want to gauge how investors are viewing the trade talks, just watch tech, and semiconductors in particular,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
Shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which also has a large exposure to China, climbed 0.97 percent, with the S&P industrial index (SPLRCI) gaining 0.63 percent. 
The energy index (SPNY) led other sectors with a 1.50 percent jump, helped by oil prices at their highest levels in nearly a month. 
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), often referred to as an investor fear gauge, dropped half-a-point to a one-month low of 19.85.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.39 percent to finish at 23,879.12 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.41 percent to 2,584.96. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.87 percent to 6,957.08.
Financial stocks (SPSY) rose 0.52 percent, with  Citigroup  (N:C) climbing 2 percent.
Echoing the Fed minutes released on Wednesday, many policymakers said they could wait on any further interest rate hikes until they had a better handle on whether growing risks will undercut an otherwise solid U.S. economic outlook.
""A more stable Fed is going to lead to more stable markets over time,"" said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.
""Some of the sharp moves in the market were driven by the fact that Fed tightening is starting to have an impact on economic growth and financial conditions.""
For the S&P, Wednesday's advance marked the benchmark index's longest streak of gains since mid-September, just before it started retreating from its record high. 
Shares in Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) sank 12.42 percent, dragging down the consumer staples index (SPLRCS), after the Corona brewer cut its fiscal 2019 profit outlook.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.91-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 5 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.0 billion shares, compared with the 9.0 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

Assets of money market funds, which are seen as nearly as safe as bank accounts, jumped $35.62 billion to $3.029 trillion in the week ended Jan. 8. This marked the first time that money fund assets surpassed $3 trillion since the week ended March 9, 2010, according to the Money Fund Report published by iMoneyNet.
During this five-week stretch, money fund assets have risen by $159.53 billion.
Yields on taxable money funds are approaching levels seen on yields on short-dated Treasuries in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's rate increase in December. 
""Cash is attractive at today's levels. Yields have come up a lot without taking on too much risks,"" said Collin Martin, director of fixed income with the Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable money-market funds averaged 2.07 percent, up from 2.04 percent the previous week, but the average seven-day simple yield for tax-free and municipal money-market funds fell to 1.19 percent from 1.28 percent last week, iMoneyNet said.
The yield on two-year Treasuries (US2YT=RR) was 2.56 percent, down 2 basis points from late on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, taxable money market fund assets increased by $34.03 billion to $2.883 trillion, while tax-free assets rose by $1.59 billion to $146.53 billion in the latest week, Money Fund Report said.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",BlackRock elevates executive behind fast-growing ETF unit: memo,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) is giving the executive behind the company's key iShares brand a job overseeing strategy, marketing and international businesses as the world's largest asset manager grooms possible successors to Chief Executive Larry Fink. Mark Wiedman, who has led the company's fast-growing index investing unit, will take the title head of international and of corporate strategy, Fink said in a memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Wiedman will be reporting to Fink, one of BlackRock's founders in 1988.
Fink has neither signaled any intention to leave nor publicly named a successor, but Wiedman is among a small group tipped as possibilities, including President Rob Kapito, Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein, Head of the Americas Mark McCombe, and Richard Kushel, the head of multi-asset strategies and global fixed income.
""The changes transforming our industry put a premium on strategy to drive growth, on unifying our focus on international markets, and on using our brand to drive our business,"" Fink said in a memo announcing staffing changes. ""With these changes, and others we'll make later this year, our aim is to bring the firm closer together, to simplify our organization, to make us more nimble, and to create new opportunities to drive growth and serve our clients.""
In 2018, investors sold off asset managers' stocks as wild-swinging markets cut funds' returns, accelerating a stampede to lower-fee products.
BlackRock's iShares unit has a leading position in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which typically track the market and are cheaper than products that try to beat the market. And while BlackRock has often been able to defend its pricing in iShares, investors fear a race to zero in that business, too.
BlackRock's stock is down nearly a third from an all-time high near $600 per share last year. It traded around $400 on Wednesday.
A former senior adviser at the U.S. Treasury and McKinsey & Co management consultant, Wiedman came to BlackRock in 2004 to run a unit focused on advising other financial institutions and governments. He took on responsibility for iShares, which BlackRock bought from  Barclays  plc (L:BARC) during the global financial crisis, in 2011.

In his memo, Fink said Salim Ramji, an executive who runs a unit involved in selling the company's funds through financial advisers and brokerages, will oversee the company's ETF and Index Investments business and report to Kapito. Martin Small, who runs iShares in U.S. and Canada, is succeeding Ramji and reports to McCombe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. non-financial firms are increasingly having difficultly earning enough to make interest payments on their debt, which is expanding faster than the economy, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance.
While Federal Reserve officials acknowledge the possibility of a pause in monetary policy tightening this year, U.S. companies have already begun to have trouble servicing their debt. The ratio of a firm's interest expenses to earnings before interest and tax - the so-called interest coverage ratio - has declined across non-bank firms since 2014.
The median interest coverage ratio is lowest in the real estate, energy and healthcare sectors. Real estate looks to be the most vulnerable, with about 50 percent of companies sporting an interest coverage ratio lower than two. That means those companies are earning less than two times the cost of their interest payments, only one of many liabilities on a corporate balance sheet.
Interest expenses have increased because of ballooning corporate debt loads in addition to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. U.S. non-financial corporate business debt is 46 percent of gross domestic product, and is currently 4 percentage points higher than it was at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, according to the IIF.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Danske Bank A/S and four former top executives were sued on Wednesday by a U.S. shareholder that accused Denmark's largest bank of defrauding investors and inflating its share price by hiding and failing to stop widespread money laundering at its Estonian branch.
The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a New York pension fund that is seeking class-action status and damages for investors in Danske's American depositary shares from Jan. 9, 2014 to Oct. 23, 2018.
Danske was accused of being ""intentionally less than forthcoming"" to Danish regulators even after a whistleblower alerted the Copenhagen-based bank to suspected money laundering, while overstating its legitimate profitability and ability to thwart misconduct.
The bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours in Europe on behalf of the defendants, who include former Chief Executive Thomas Borgen, former Chairman Ole Andersen, and two former chief financial officers.
Borgen resigned last Sept. 19, when Danske said an internal probe had uncovered about 200 billion euros (US$231 billion) of payments made from 2007 to 2015 through its small Estonian branch, and that many payments appeared suspicious.
Andersen was replaced in December.
Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Great Britain and the United States are investigating the payments, including in a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice. Danske has said it has been cooperating with authorities.
The Sept. 19 report came one year after Danske expanded its probe into the Estonian branch, following what it called ""a root cause analysis concluding that several major deficiencies led to the branch not being sufficiently effective in preventing it from potentially being used for money laundering.""
According to the complaint, the market value of Danske's ADRs fell by more than $2.54 billion as investors learned of the full scope of the scandal.
It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States after what they consider unexpected share price declines.
The lawsuit is led by the Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 773 Pension Fund of Glens Falls, New York. Its law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd specializes in securities fraud.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chrysler Building, an Art Deco masterpiece that has been a defining image of New York City's skyline for decades, has been put up for sale, a minority owner of the building and a broker hired to market the property said on Wednesday.
The 77-story stainless steel-clad skyscraper, briefly the world's tallest building after it was finished in 1930, is 90 percent owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a sovereign wealth fund, with developer Tishman Speyer owning the remainder. 
""It's exciting. I'm getting inquiries from all over the world,"" said Darcy Stacom, chairman and head of New York City Capital Markets at brokerage  CBRE  Group Inc (N:CBRE).
The 1.26 million square foot building underwent a $100 million renovation after Tishman acquired the property in 1997. Tishman later reduced its holding. The sovereign wealth fund paid $800 million when it bought its stake in 2008. 
The building's brand and its location on 42nd Street just east of Grand Central Terminal, a major Manhattan transportation hub, are ripe for greater retail exploitation, Stacom said.
The building's occupancy rate is in the low 80 percent range, below the city average, according to CBRE. Stacom declined to reveal the asking price for the building.
Stacom declined to give the building's asking price.
Buildings on average are 50 years old in Midtown and many store-fronts are empty, hard hit by e-commerce. With the new Hudson Yards district on the far West Side attracting major corporations, concerns have been raised about Midtown's appeal.
But Midtown remains a favored business destination. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) plans to build a new headquarters on nearby Park Avenue. One Vanderbilt, a marquee office tower, is rising just west of Grand Central.
Age could be a selling point, too, as seen by the popularity of Midtown South, which has the city's lowest vacancy rate and companies such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) occupy century-old structures.
The decision to sell a property is driven by numerous factors, not often due to unsatisfactory performance, said Patrice Derrington, director of the real estate development program at Columbia University.
""New York City constantly offers an appropriately varied array of formats for office tenants, creating a complementary ecosystem,"" she said.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 02:13PM ET</span>","VW, Ford to reveal deeper alliance next week: sources","By Jan Schwartz and Ben Klayman
HAMBURG/DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will unveil a deeper alliance next week that goes beyond cooperating in commercial vehicles in a move meant to save the automakers billions of dollars as they develop new technologies, two people familiar with the plan said on Wednesday.
Ford and VW have been exploring closer cooperation as trade frictions force carmakers to rethink where they build vehicles for Europe, the United States and China, and as software companies prepare to launch their own self-driving cars. 
“A global alliance is expected to be announced,” one person said, adding that the pact will be unveiled next Tuesday during the Detroit auto show. The companies have previously said any alliance would not involve a merger or equity stakes.
The expanding alliance highlights the growing pressure on all global automakers to manage the costs of developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as technology required to meet tougher emissions standards for millions of internal combustion vehicles they will sell in the years to come.
Slowdowns in the world's largest auto markets - China and the United States - have ratcheted up the pressure to cut costs. 
The scope of the alliance is still being determined, the people said, as talks about cooperation in the area of electric and autonomous cars continue. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are ongoing.
""Talks are going well,"" the second person said. 
The framework of the alliance would include the pooling of resources in autonomous technology and VW investing in that Ford business, and Ford licensing Volkswagen's MEB electric vehicles platform, the person added. 
When the commercial vehicle alliance is announced next week, the companies will also say they are close on deals covering the autonomous and electric vehicle businesses, the person said.
VW officials have talked about gaining access to Ford's Transit commercial van and the Ranger midsized pickup truck, as well as building their vehicles in Ford plants.
Ford reiterated on Wednesday it has been talking with VW about potential collaborations in a number of areas.
""It is premature to share additional details at this time,"" Ford said in a statement. ""We look forward to sharing an update soon.”
VW had no immediate comment.
Ford shares were up 3.9 percent at $8.70 on Wednesday afternoon. VW shares gained 2.4 percent to close at 146.48 euros.
SEEKING A MASS MARKET FOR EVs
In June, Ford and VW unveiled a pact in commercial vehicles including vans, adding that they were investigating ""several joint projects"".
In December, VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess said, ""We are in quite advanced negotiations and dialogue with Ford Corporation to really build up a global automotive alliance, which also would strengthen the American automotive industry.""
At the time, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told reporters that talks with Volkswagen about an alliance were going ""very well."" 
Diess has talked openly about the savings and greater efficiencies that Europe's largest automaker hoped to achieve through the potential alliance. VW officials also have repeatedly emphasized the only way to make electric cars a mass-market product is through economies of scale to make them as affordable as diesel vehicles. 
The alliance with Volkswagen serves as a big bet for Ford CEO Jim Hackett since he took over in May 2017 from the ousted Mark Fields with the mandate to speed up decision-making and cut costs. Some analysts and investors have been frustrated by Ford's laggard stock price and a perceived lack of details from Hackett about the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker's $11 billion restructuring.
Ford officials had called the commercial vehicle program a ""quick win"" and discussed how a broader tie-up would allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to reduce the number of different vehicles it builds and shrink manufacturing, engineering and purchasing costs.
An alliance would help Ford achieve its goal of doubling global pretax profit margins to 8 percent by 2020, up from 4.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018.
In July 2018, Ford created a separate unit to house its self-driving vehicle operations and was seeking outside investors in a move similar to one made by General Motors Co (N:GM) with its Cruise Automation self-driving unit.
Ford said then it would invest $4 billion through 2023 in its newly formed Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, including the $1 billion it previously had earmarked for Argo AI, the Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup it acquired in 2017.
Ford expects to launch self-driving vehicles for sale by 2021, when a new vehicle architecture designed specifically for autonomous vehicles is expected to be ready.

The Detroit auto show runs from Jan. 14 to Jan. 27.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 01:53PM ET</span>",Airbus loses to Boeing in annual jet order race,"PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus lost out to Boeing (NYSE:BA) in 2018, breaking a five-year winning streak against its U.S. rival for the number of jet orders, slumping to its lowest share of the $150 billion jet market in six years, data showed on Wednesday.
Airbus posted 747 net 2018 orders, down 33 percent from the previous year, including 135 for the A220 jetliner which it took over from Canada's Bombardier in July. Boeing beat Airbus for the first time since 2012 with 893 net orders.
Airbus delivered 800 jets, up 11 percent, including 20 of the small A220 model, leaving Boeing as the world's largest planemaker by manufacturing volume for a seventh straight year.
Although Boeing missed its delivery target and Airbus had previously lowered its target due to strains on the industry's global supply chain, strong demand for passenger jets expanded total deliveries by 8 percent, the fastest pace in six years.
Planemaking chief Guillaume Faury welcomed the deliveries, which set a company record, and a ""healthy order intake,"" with waiting lists for many new jets stretching for up to 7 years.
Insiders say the quest for new business has, however, been overshadowed in the past year by industrial problems, management changes and morale problems coinciding with a corruption probe. 
A resurgent Boeing has been cashing in on greater availability and declining costs for its 787 Dreamliner, while struggling to contain its European rival in the lucrative segment for large narrowbody jets just above 200 seats.
The order figures underscore Airbus's decision to take over the lightweight but loss-making Bombardier CSeries aircraft, generating 135 orders worth $12 billion at list prices.
Without that boost, Airbus took just 41 percent of the core market in which it competes with Boeing, the lowest since 2009.
Highlighting the pressure Airbus has been facing recently in the market for large, high-margin wide-body jets, the European company was outsold three to one by Boeing for a second year.
However it reached a targeted production rate of 10 aircraft a month for its wide-body A350, which competes with the 787 and larger 777, at the end of the year, company officials said.
Airbus also trimmed the order list for its slow-selling A380 superjumbo, officially cancelling an order for 10 from Hong Kong Airlines four years after Reuters first reported that the airline had axed the deal, triggering financial negotiations.

The world's largest airliner is mostly dependent on Dubai's Emirates as Airbus slows production to a trickle in the hope of a future upturn, though many airlines are for now backing smaller jets.

Stocks have staged one heck of a rally off their Christmastime lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged roughly 2,200 points from its intraday low on Dec. 26 through the middle of this week, while the S&P 500 climbed about 250 points.
The catalysts? Soothing talk from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the future path of interest rates last week, followed by some happy chatter about U.S.-China trade talks this week.
Throw in the fact stocks were deeply oversold anyway, and voila! You have some pretty powerful ingredients for a sizable, short-term rally.
It's nice to see stocks regain some lost ground. Unfortunately for the bulls, this may not mean squat in the grand scheme of things. It’s likely just more “Squirrel Syndrome” stuff you shouldn’t let distract you.
No, the biggestnews from a stock market standpoint was the failure of money-losing WeWork Cos. to get another huge infusion of cash from its lead investor, SoftBank Group.
If you haven’t heard of WeWork, it’s one of the world’s biggest tech “unicorns” – companies valued at $1 billion or more. It provides so-called “co-working facilities” where freelance, professional, and by-the-hour or by-the-gig workers rent small amounts of space to conduct important meetings, network, or just get out of their apartments.
Founded in 2010, WeWork has grown rapidly. It now operates more than 230 locations in 22 countries. The only problem? Like many of its fellow unicorns, it doesn’t make any money. That means it needs continual infusions of cash to fund the acquiring, remodeling and marketing of buildings and offices.
In fact, We Work managed to lose $934 million in 2017, then another $1.2 billion in the first three quarters of 2018. But thanks to the bubble in private and public tech markets, its valuation grew to a whopping $45 billion as of November.
Unfortunately for WeWork, the gravy train appears to be derailing. As both the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported this week, SoftBank was originally planning to shovel as much as $16 billion into WeWork in a new mega-funding deal.
But other investors who were asked to cough up money, including the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, reportedly balked. They felt WeWork’s $36 billion valuation was too high and that SoftBank was already too exposed to the firm, thanks to past direct and indirect investments of around $10 billion.
As a result, instead of a $16 billion investment, WeWork will get just $2 billion. That’s 88% less money, and a significant chunk of the dough will go toward buying out existing shareholders rather than funding the company’s ongoing, sizable losses.
What happens in the private tech market invariably spills over into the public tech market. That’s what makes this WeWork news so important.
You see, many of WeWork’s fellow unicorns are lining up at the public cash trough. They’re all hoping to launch multibillion-dollar IPOs to fund their own huge losses in 2019. Ride-sharing firms Uber and Lyft, and office software firm Slack, are among the leading candidates.
But many of 2018’s formerly red hot IPOs have crashed and burned in the after-market, leaving investors who bought into the hype nursing serious financial wounds. And even those who didn’t have to be looking around the metaphorical room and thinking “Do I really want to be the patsy who keeps funding never-ending operating losses at ever-rising valuations?”
So expect many proposed IPO deals in 2019 to get cut in size, cut in price, or fail to launch altogether. That, in turn, will force wing-and-a-prayer, no-profit-generating, tech companies with Dot-Com-era business plans to either get their houses in order, or go broke.
A pessimistic view? No. It’s a realistic one, one that comes from an analyst who worked at a Dot-Com himself in the late 1990s and early 2000s. So, I urge you to ...
Continue to avoid buying shares of money-losing companies either directly in their IPOs or in the aftermarket.
Avoid investments like the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), which tracks the performance of companies that go public. It’s already down roughly 13% in the past year. But if I’m right, that’s going to be just the start of an even-bigger collapse.
If you’re feeling more aggressive and are comfortable with the idea of targeting downside profits, consider adding an inverse ETF or two targeting the technology sector. The sharp rally over the past several days has all the hallmarks of a bear market bounce: Extremely sharp, extremely sudden, and extremely likely to run out of gas before too long.
ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID) is one I’m fond of. Just keep in mind that you have to “trade around” these types of positions given the longer-term tracking error of leveraged ETFs and the likelihood of sharp snapback moves like what we just saw. You’ll find guidance on how to do that, as well as specific BUY and SELL recommendations, in my Safe Money Report."
1429,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",ETFs on U.S. Dollar & Euro FX provide profitable spreads,"In the international export-import business competing currencies force the U.S. dollar higher, a disadvantage for a country wishing to sell products on the world market notes Paul Cretien.
For trading purposes, exchange traded funds (ETFs) on the U.S. dollar index and the euro currency are more than an ordinary pair of securities that have a predictable relationship. The Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (UUP) and the Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Currency ETF (FXE) have a negative correlation that may produce specific trading opportunities (see chart).
The chart shows how the UUP and FXE appear as mirror images as their price changes are almost perfectly negatively correlated. The euro is one of several currencies whose price changes are inverted to those of the U.S. dollar, but the euro is the most powerful of these, having the greatest weight in the index.
There are several profitable trades suggested by this negative correlation. The trades depend on UUP falling in price with respect to the price of FXE over the early months in 2019. Viewing the chart, it is easy to imagine FXE and UUP as two lovers who embraced twice during the year 2018 and are eager to meet again in 2019. Spring and summer are made for romance between two currencies.
Just as the U.S. dollar is not independent, but is controlled by the inverse relationship with other currencies, the others are also not completely independent. For example, when one currency falls in price (either on purpose in order to improve its export trade, or due to a major geopolitical event as with the British pound following the Brexit vote) other countries that are economic competitors also reduce their currencies’ prices in response.
Three currencies that are competing for low price are the Swiss franc, Australian dollar and the euro. Their combined effect on the price of the U.S. dollar index is shown on the chart below.
In the international export-import business competing currencies force the U.S. dollar higher, a higher currency price is a distinct disadvantage for a country wishing to sell products on the world market. A relatively high price for the U.S. dollar benefits importers, such as American tourists traveling to Europe. For Americans producing goods for sale on foreign markets, it is bad for business.
In 2018 the Swiss franc, euro, and Australian dollar fell by 2.40%, 6.35%, and 10.11% , respectively, while the U.S. dollar index increased by 7.66%. This means, for example, that U.S. export products increased in price by approximately 14% relative to the euro. This is equivalent to a tariff of 14% on U.S. goods exported to European countries. One way to counteract this difference is for the United States to apply a 14% tariff on imports from the other countries. These differentials are what the trade wars going on currently are all about.
To take advantage of the U.S. dollar and euro “mirror image” trade, consider buying puts on the dollar-based UUP ETF, and buying calls on euro-based FXE ETF. This is a classic reversion trade, with the UUP/FXE differential at its highest point over the last year. A time span of three-to-five months may see the two prices coming close together or actually meeting and crossing as they did between April and May of 2018. With this time frame in mind, an expiration date in June 2019 would be appropriate.
One source of options price chains for UUP and FXE is Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) finance.com. For the June 21, 2019, expiration date on Jan. 4, 2019, eight strike prices are listed for UUP puts ranging from $20 to $30, with a $25.46 closing price for UUP on Jan. 4. Eighteen strike prices are shown for the June 21, 2019, expiration of FXE calls, ranging from $88 to $119 with a current price of $108.93 for FXE. Thus, there is no shortage of potentially profitable options trades for currency ETFs."
1430,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Can the Saudi Put, Put a Floor in Crude Oil","Just as the Federal Reserve is thought to use policy to protect equity markets, Saudi Arabia tries to manage crude oil prices by manipulating its production levels writes Phil Flynn of The PRICE Futures Group.
You have heard about the so-called Fed put. That is a term that means the Federal Reserve has the markets back. If the markets or economy start to falter, the Fed’s plunge protection team will get into gear and adjust monetary policy to create a floor for the market. That in turn gives investors confidence to take on more risk because, even if the market gets weak, the Fed won’t allow it to crash.
With the recent rebound in crude oil, traders are now talking about the Saudi put. That is that Saudi Arabia will not allow oil prices to fall and if it does, they will cut production accordingly. In fact, the Saudi announcement that they want $80 a barrel for crude, and that they will reduce their exports by 800,000 barrels-per-day is sending a signal to the market that the worst for oil may be over.
Of course, Saudi Arabia’s power to manipulate the price of crude oil has diminished some in the age of shale, and it helps that the global stock markets are showing more optimism. So called progress on the U.S.-China trade discussions is bringing the risk appetite back into the marketplace and cumulative measures talked about in Asia to boost their economy is changing the pessimism about overall energy demand. A senior Chinese official said China plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. This comes after China lowered their reserve requirement for bank lending that, along with more stimuli should raise oil demand expectations.
This comes as the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan. 4, according to sources. This massive drop in supply is showing that previous cuts by the Saudis are already showing up and this could be the beginning of a massive drain on U.S. oil supplies.
Of course, that is looking forward. In the short term, the big drop in crude was offset by mindboggling builds in products. The API reported that gasoline stockpiles surged by an astounding 5.5 million barrels, while distillate inventories rocketed by 10.2 million barrels. The post market reaction seemed to shrug off the product build and focus more on the crude draw.
U.S. shale operators are still in pullback mode and with the OPEC cuts about to drain our supplies; the bottom in oil looks solid. Of course, if we see a reversal or panic in stocks that could change, but for now the new oil uptrend will be your friend.
Yet despite the price drop in the big picture, energy supply prospects for the future continue to brighten. Reuters reported that  BP  (LON:BP) struck black gold discovering two new oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico that could bring an additional billion barrels of oil at an existing field, thanks to new seismic technology.
Reuters writes: “The company has put a heavy emphasis on technology and data processing capabilities in recent years in order to unlock new resources and cut costs. The $1.3 billion Atlantis Phase 3 development will include drilling eight wells and a new subsea production system that will boost BP’s production by 38,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day. It is scheduled to start production in 2020. Together with the new discoveries, BP aims to grow its Gulf of Mexico production from over 300,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day at present to 400,000 by the mid-2020s. BP said that new seismic technology helped it identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil at its Thunder Horse field within weeks, whereas previously it would have taken a year to analyze.”
Remember peak oil and you can’t drill your way to energy independence? Neither do I.
Hellenic Shipping News reports that the middle distillates complex in Asia rolled out 2019 on diverging paths. While the gasoil market has made a strong comeback since plummeting to its lowest level on Dec. 21, co-distillate jet fuel continued to remain sluggish. Market sources said that this trend was likely to continue for the rest of the month, citing diverging fundamentals between the two products.
Despite the Asian gasoil market kicking off the year on a steady footing, some traders cautioned that looking forward; the middle distillate might be on track for a sustained recovery from here. Some traders hold a more bullish sentiment for the Asian gasoil market in the near term, pointing out that volumes flowing out of the region have helped to ease the overhang in supply. “For January, Asia exported over 1 million mt of gasoil out of the region,” a trader said, adding that gasoil might see an overall improvement in fundamentals.
Conversely, the Asian jet fuel/kerosene spot market started the year on a weaker footing, as a glut of surplus cargoes pressured cash differentials deeper into discount territory. While demand has been steady amid the ongoing winter season, market participants continued to point to a ready availability of cargoes from South Korea and China."
1431,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Bank of Canada unlikely to tighten, Loonie looks strong regardless","The Canadian dollar looks bullish despite the fact that the Bank of Canada is unlikely to raise rates with inflation under control according Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst FOREX.com.
The first major central bank announcement of the year is upon us. The Bank of Canada is going to make a decision on whether to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve and hike interest rates by 25 basis points when it concludes its meeting later on today. Ahead of the rate decision, the Canadian dollar was up for the sixth consecutive day against the dollar and fourth straight day against the Japanese yen. The USD/CAD was trading around 1.3230 and CAD/JPY was hovering around 82.30 at the time of writing.
A few months ago, a rate increase in January looked very likely from the BOC. However, the probabilities of a hike have since fallen sharply, owing to the recent falls in global stock and crude oil prices — the latter being Canada’s major export commodity — and weakness in global and domestic economic data. Nonetheless, the Canadian dollar has surged back to life in recent days, along with other commodity currencies, crude oil prices and equity markets.
Sentiment towards risky assets, which includes the Canadian dollar, has improved markedly over the past several days, in part because of apparent progress in U.S.-China trade talks, among other factors. Yesterday, for example, President Donald Trump tweeted that talks with China on trade were “going very well,” while today Bloomberg has reported that China has confirmed that the talks have now concluded, and a statement will follow soon.
Today, the Canadian dollar could extend its gains on the back of a surprise rate increase from the BOC, although we don’t think the central bank is going to hike. Even so, the currency could remain supported if the Bank turns out to be hawkish about the prospects of future rate increases. However, if the central bank turns out to be surprisingly more dovish than expected, then the CAD could give up a big chunk of its recent gains.
One of the reasons why we think the BOC will hold rates unchanged today is because inflation in Canada has fallen noticeably in recent months. Just three months ago, consumer inflation stood at 2.4%. Now it has fallen to just 1.7%. With wage growth also weak, not to mention the drop in oil prices, the prospects of a jump in inflation is unlikely. Against this backdrop, the BOC will most likely maintain status quo and hold the benchmark interest rate at its current 1.75% rate. Canadian interest rates have risen five times since the summer of 2017, with the most recent increase coming in October of last year.
Among the CAD crosses, the CAD/JPY looks very interesting after it formed a solid reversal hammer candlestick pattern on its weekly chart last week (see chart).
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com.
 Crucially, we have seen further follow-through to the upside at the start of this week, providing more evidence that the buyers are regaining control. So, as things stand, the path of least resistance is to the upside for the CAD/JPY. We continue to expect the dips to be supported, unless the BOC is very dovish today. Short-term support comes in the range between 81.80 and 82.00, followed by the point of origin of the breakout at 80.65. On the upside, I can’t see any major levels on the daily chart until 83.10/15, which also happens to be the mid-point of the drop from the October peak.
Potentially a much stronger resistance zone is seen around the 200-day moving average, which at 84.90 seems miles away from here."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said Wednesday it is recalling another 1.7 million vehicles worldwide for potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators as part of a multi-year industry recall campaign announced in 2016.
Automakers are adding about 10 million vehicle inflators in the United States to what was already the largest-ever recall campaign in history. Last week, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it was recalling 953,000 vehicles worldwide for Takata inflators. Previously, 37 million U.S. vehicles with 50 million inflators were recalled and 16.7 million inflators remain to be replaced.
At least 23 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators, including 15 in the United States.
Toyota's new recall relates to vehicles from the 2010 through 2015 model years, and includes 1.3 million vehicles in the United States.
More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide.
To date, 21 deaths have been reported in Honda Motor Co (T:7267) vehicles and two in Ford vehicles. Both automakers have urged some drivers of older vehicles not to drive them until the inflators are replaced.
The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. In April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company, known as Joyson Safety Systems, is a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699). 

Automakers in the United States repaired more than 7.2 million defective Takata air bag inflators in 2018 as companies ramped up efforts to track down parts in need of replacement, according to a report released last month.

Lennar (NYSE:LEN) rallied 8% as the company reported earnings of $1.96 a share, a penny above consensus on Capital IQ. Revenue jumped 71% to $6.46 billion, but narrowly missed analysts' estimates for $6.55 billion.
Management was also bullish on the earnings call, noting that while demand had slowed, that was part of a normal seasonal pattern and saying that the housing market would rebound on a solid fundamental backdrop, Briefing.com reported.
Lennar decided against providing guidance for the fiscal year, blaming ""continued softness, and uncertainty,"" in the fourth quarter, which is typically the slowest time of the year for homebuilding.
Analysts were unhappy by Lennar's decision to defer guidance, saying uncertainty would likely continue until the spring selling season that starts in February.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) surged 4% ahead of its report due after the closing bell.
Analysts forecast the homebuilder generated earnings of 94 cents a share on revenue of more than $1.3 billion.
Homebuilders have managed a bold start to the year, picking up from a rally that got underway in the final week of December last year, though remain down 24% over the last 12 months."

TORONTO (Reuters) - Workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario staged a sit-down protest that interrupted production for about two hours on Wednesday morning, a union spokeswoman said, following a similar protest late on Tuesday.
The action came after Unifor, the union representing the autoworkers, failed to win GM's support for its proposals to save the plant. Unifor, which has vowed to block GM's plan to close Oshawa by the end of 2019, met with GM officials in Detroit on Tuesday.
""Workers are now returning to the line with production expected to resume shortly,"" Unifor spokeswoman Kathleen O'Keefe said. While production was affected for approximately two hours, a full shut-down was intermittent.
On Tuesday night, production stopped for nearly five hours after workers downed their tools, the union said. 
It was unclear if a second shift on Wednesday would interrupt production and what impact the protests had on output.
The Oshawa plant closure, which GM has said would affect 2,973 assembly-line jobs, was announced in November as part of a broad restructuring aimed at cutting costs as investments increase in electric and autonomous vehicles. 
GM has also not allocated new products for four U.S. plants, raising the possibility of their closure and the elimination of a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America. 
Oshawa, which produces GM's Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, has the capacity to produce 310,000 vehicles, but its 2018 utilization was just 22 percent, according to LMC Automotive.

""We understand our union's frustration, but need to now work together to deliver supports, transition and training for our employees,"" said GM spokesman David Paterson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department has said in a court filing that a partial government shutdown could delay its response to comments on pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp's purchase of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET), a necessary step in a court giving final approval to the deal.
Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has been reviewing a consent decree reached by the government and the companies in October to allow their $69 billion merger. The deal has closed, although Judge Leon has required that some aspects of integration be halted during the review process.
Additionally, the Justice Department is required to respond to public comments on the consent agreement. It said in a court filing late on Tuesday that a lapse in funding as of midnight on Jan. 4 meant that the Antitrust Division could not process those comments until its appropriations were restored.
An exception could be made if the court orders them to do so, the department said in the filing.
The partial shutdown began hitting government agencies on Dec. 22 as part of a battle between the White House, which is demanding billions to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, and congressional Democrats, who say the expenditure would be ineffective in slowing illegal immigration.

A spokesman for CVS had no immediate comment.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia has severely dented the kingdom's private jet industry in a sign of the impact the campaign has had on private enterprise and the wealthy elite.
Dozens of planes, owned by individuals and charter companies and worth hundreds of millions of dollars, are stranded at airports across the kingdom including Riyadh and Jeddah, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Some were handed over to the state in settlements reached after the crackdown was launched in late 2017, when dozens of princes, businessmen and government officials were detained, they said.
Others belong to Saudis who either face travel bans or are reluctant to fly the planes because they are wary of displays of wealth that might be seen as taunting the government over the anti-corruption campaign, two of the sources said.
The government media office did not respond to requests for comment. The General Authority of Civil Aviation said questions on the impact of the anti-corruption drive on the private jet industry were outside its mandate, adding that its relationship with private aviation covers operations, safety and regulations.
The crackdown's impact on the business community and private enterprise, which are already reeling from low oil prices and weakened consumer confidence, has shattered investor confidence and contributed to a sense of uncertainty around the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The idle aircraft, which one of the sources estimated at up to about 70, include Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Gulfstream jets, the sources said. There are also larger Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) aircraft that are more commonly associated with commercial airlines but are often used in the Middle East as private jets.
A Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo can cost up to $130 million, though the final cost depends on how the jet is fitted out with technology and amenities, including private bedrooms, meeting rooms, and even gym equipment. 
The number of registered private jets in Saudi Arabia stood at 129 as of December 2018 compared with 136 a year earlier, according to FlightAscend Consultancy data. 
Private jets offer users flexibility as, unlike commercial airliners, they are not constrained by arrival and departure time slots. They also enable users to travel more discreetly. 
UNDER THE RADAR
Saudi Arabia's finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, said last month the state had collected more than 50 billion riyals ($13.33 billion) from settlements reached under the crackdown.
Most of the detainees held at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel in November 2017 were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government, which said it aims to seize more than $100 billion in total in either cash or assets. 
It is unclear how the government would transfer ownership of the jets grounded across Saudi Arabia as many are owned through offshore firms or are mortgaged, two of the sources familiar with the matter said. 
Three of the sources said it was likely that the jets were still registered in the kingdom.
Two of the sources said the government could absorb the aircraft into existing fleets used by ministries and state-owned corporations. A third source said the government had been looking to set up its own private jet company made up entirely of seized aircraft.
The anti-corruption campaign launched by Prince Mohammed has won widespread approval among ordinary Saudis, partly because the government has said it will use some of the funds to finance social benefits.
Critics have said the purge was a power play by the prince as he moved to consolidate power in his hands.
There have been few private jet flights in Saudi Arabia over the past year, largely because there are fewer planes readily available, including for charter, three of the sources familiar with the matter said. 
VistaJet Chief Commercial Officer Ian Moore compared it to the situation in China where an anti-corruption crackdown has also weakened the private jet market.
""It's not really politically great to be seen flying privately at the moment, particularly owning your own aircraft,"" he told Reuters.
Some wealthy Saudi elite are taking commercial airlines to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other destinations and then chartering private jets to avoid government scrutiny, two of the sources said.
Plane manufacturers said the appetite for business jet sales in Saudi Arabia has dropped since the anti-corruption crackdown was launched in November 2017.
""Political instability does not help consumer confidence in any way, shape or form,"" Embraer Executive Jets Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Friedrich told Reuters.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday sacked the chiefs of Sui Natural Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern (NYSE:SO) Gas Company Limited (SSGC) over a severe winter energy crisis that has seen repeated supply outages. 
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the government's main spokesman, said Khan took the decision after an inquiry committee found that the two companies were responsible for the crisis.
Since the start of the winter, Pakistanis using natural gas for cooking and heating, as well as factories and power plants that rely on the fuel, have experienced significant inconvenience due to low gas pressure or no supply at all. 
Factories and business in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan's commercial hub, have been badly affected, threatening jobs and the livelihoods of workers.
""Recently, people have faced a severe gas supply crisis,"" Chaudhry said in a statement...The prime minister has announced the immediate sacking of the heads Sui Southern and Sui Northern,"" the statement said. 
Pakistan has suffered from chronic energy supply problems for years, with regular power blackouts and gas outages caused by a mix of poorly maintained distribution networks, inefficient regulation and poor governance.
The country has significant natural gas reserves that can fill almost half its energy requirements but supply constraints have led to increasing demand for LNG imports.
Khan's critics say the natural gas companies are not solely responsible for the recent energy crisis, pointing to decisions made by his government which have discouraged the importing of LNG. 
In October, the new government announced it would renegotiate agreements for two liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals as part of a wider investigation into deals struck by the previous government.
The rapid adoption of LNG infrastructure made Pakistan one of the industry's fastest-growing markets in Asia, sparking interest from the world's major energy producers and traders. 

As part of moves to increase energy generation, Pakistan and the World Bank on Wednesday signed a financing agreement worth $100 million for a solar energy project in the southern part of the country, a finance ministry statement said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The former chief executive of Insys Therapeutics Inc is expected on Wednesday to plead guilty to participating in a scheme to pay doctors bribes in exchange for prescribing an addictive opioid medication.
Michael Babich, who resigned as the Arizona-based drugmaker's CEO in 2015, is scheduled to appear in federal court in Boston and plead guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud charges, according to court papers.
His plea comes weeks before a five former Insys executives and managers including John Kapoor, the company’s founder and former chairman, are scheduled to face trial over what prosecutors said was their roles in the wide-ranging scheme.
The terms of Babich's plea deal have not been disclosed, leaving it unclear whether he has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify at that trial. Kapoor and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy.
Insys in August said it had agreed to settle a related U.S. Justice Department probe for at least $150 million. The company has said it is now under new management, which has taken steps to ensure it operates legally going forward. 
Babich's attorney declined to comment.
The case centers on Subsys, Insys' under-the-tongue spray for managing severe pain in cancer patients. It contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.
Prosecutors allege that from 2012 to 2015, Kapoor, Babich and others conspired to bribe doctors in exchange for prescribing Subsys. Prosecutors said they also defrauded insurers into paying for the pain treatment.
Prosecutors allege Insys paid doctors kickbacks in the form of fees to participate in speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about Subsys that were actually sham events.
The case is a major example of their efforts to combat the nation's opioid addiction epidemic, prosecutors said. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017.
Babich's expected plea comes after Alec Burlakoff, Insys' former vice president of sales, pleaded guilty in November and agreed to testify as a government witness.
Babich, 42, is married to a former Insys sales representative, Natalie Babich, who in 2017 pleaded guilty to conspiring to pay kickbacks and became a government witness.

She testified last month at the trial of Christopher Clough, a former physician assistant in New Hampshire accused of accepting kickbacks from Insys. A federal jury in Concord, New Hampshire convicted Clough on Dec. 18.

Local media had earlier reported that Proximus planned to cut its workforce by 15 percent by axing 2,000 positions.
Economy minister Kris Peeters was quoted by Belga as saying that the former state monopoly operator had outlined its plans and these entailed cutting 1,900 posts, while also hiring 1,250.
The head of the company was summoned on Wednesday morning to with Prime Minister Charles Michel and members of his government. The Belgian state owns 53.5 percent of Proximus shares.
The loss of so many jobs would be bad news for the government ahead of an election at the end of May. The job cuts may also be a response to government plans to allow a fourth mobile operator to enter the Belgian market.
Proximus's main current competitors are Telenet (BR:TNET) and Orange Belgium (BR:OBEL).

Trading in Proximus shares was suspended at the opening on Wednesday until the company releases a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks extended their gains to hit a near-four week high and oil prices rose on Wednesday on optimism that the United States and China may be inching toward a trade deal, soothing fears of an all-out trade war.
Delegations from China and the U.S. ended talks that had lasted longer than expected in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China's markets. Officials said details would be released soon. 
MSCI's all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) sailed 0.5 percent higher in a fourth day of gains. 
Hopes for a trade deal boosted Europe's export-oriented autos and tech sectors and lifted the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark to a three-week high. Germany's DAX (GDAXI), France's CAC 40 (FCHI) and the UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) all gained around 1 percent to hover at multi-week highs. 
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) (NQc1)  firmed between 0.2 and 0.4 percent, pointing to another upbeat session ahead for Wall Street after the S&P 500 (SPX) gained nearly 1 percent on Tuesday. 
Asian bourses saw a strong finish with Japan's Nikkei (N225) and China's blue-chip CSI 300 (CSI300) closing up 1 percent while the tech-heavy South Korean KOSPI (KS11) jumped nearly 2 percent. 
""The positive news around the trade talks is giving a boost to risk assets – it's what the global economy needs to see,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.
Adding to the upbeat mood were reports that Beijing plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. These come on the back of Friday's monetary easing by the People's Bank of China.
""China are now firmly off the brakes and back on the accelerator,"" said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. 
""The sugar rush that's fading in the U.S., we are going to get that rush coming through in China.""
However, details on the outcome of the latest trade talks were scant and sources said the two sides were still far from U.S. demands for structural reforms in China.
SUGAR RUSH 
The rally in riskier assets has accelerated since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year.
Oil prices roared 2 percent higher in their eight day of gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) have soared more than 20 percent since hitting an 18-month low in late December and have now broken through the $50 per barrel overnight for the first time in 2019. 
U.S. bond yields also climbed, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.7386 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday's strong payrolls data.
In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures <0#FF:> showed traders are now pricing in a small chance of a rate hike in 2019, a change from late last week when futures markets had priced in a cut.
In currency markets, the dollar index (DXY) softened to 95.835 against a basket of currencies after flirting in early trading with a 2-1/2 month low hit on Monday. The euro traded at $1.1452 (EUR=) while the dollar stood at 108.86 yen .
China's yuan  strengthened in offshore trading by 0.4 percent, hitting its strongest level in five weeks. 
Sterling gained 0.2 percent against the dollar  and strengthened against the euro (EURGBP=D3) following a media report that British Prime Minister Theresa May is attempting to win over the Northern Irish DUP party in a crucial vote next week on her Brexit deal.

The British parliament is due to vote on the EU withdrawal bill on Jan. 15 and the issue is likely to dominate sterling trade in the run-up. May will lose the vote unless she can convince opponents both within and outside her Conservative Party to back the deal.

1498,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- CGI Group GIB,"It's been a strange and unnerving 12 months, filled with plot twists worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy, cautions Gordon Pape, a Canada-based investment expert and editor of Internet Wealth Builder.
Back in early January, who would have believed that Canada would be deemed a strategic risk to the U.S. and have tariffs slapped on our steel and aluminum exports? Who foresaw Canadian oil prices falling to record lows, deepening the recession in Alberta?
How could we have predicted the economic and political fallout that we're now experiencing after the arrest of a Chinese business executive in Vancouver at the request of the U.S.? And the list goes on and on. It has truly been a bizarre year! Unhappily, 2019 isn't looking a lot better.
Meanwhile, our top pick for more aggressive investors is CGI Group (GIB). Montreal-based CGI is the fifth largest independent information technology and business process services firm in the world.
It employs about 74,000 professionals in offices and delivery centers across the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The stock dropped a little during the December correction and looks attractive at the current price. The balance sheet is solid.
At 2018 fiscal year-end, the company had $184.1 million in cash and $1.3 billion in unused credit facilities. This is an international company with excellent upside potential.

1499,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Home Depot HD,"There is 24% upside to our price target for  Home Depot  Inc. (NYSE:HD). We believe that the 17% pullback from its September high provides a favorable entry point, suggests analyst Chris Graja with Argus Research, a leading independent Wall Street Research firm.
The company has raised its dividend at a 22% compound annual rate over the past five years. It also recently raised its target payout ratio to 55% from 50%. The current yield is an attractive 2.3%.
Fundamentals remain strong. HD has raised its operating margin by more than 400 basis points over the last five years. In fiscal 3Q19, EPS rose 36% from the prior year and topped the consensus forecast.
Comp sales at U.S. stores rose 5.4% in 3Q19, on top of 7.7% growth in 3Q18. Online sales rose 28% in 3Q19. Overall economic growth is a more important sales driver for Home Depot than housing activity.
HD is shareholder friendly. The trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 42.2% in 3Q, up an impressive 970 basis points from the prior year. The ROIC exceeded the cost of capital by 33 percentage points.
The company repurchased $5.5 billion of its stock in the first three quarters of FY19 and has repurchased approximately $80 billion since 2002. Our 12-month target price is $220 per share. This implies a multiple of 22-times our forward-four-quarter EPS estimate.

1500,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- IAMGOLD Corporation IAG,"Our favorite speculative play for several years has been IAMGOLD Corporation (IAG (LON:ICAG)), a gold exploration and mining company with mines in North American, South America and in West Africa, suggests Alan Newman, market strategist and editor of Crosscurrents.
The company’s headquarters are in Toronto, Canada and the firm has interests in at least ten operations that we are aware of, including copper and silver. The shares traded as high as $23.88 in September 2011, in concert with the peak in bullion prices over $1900 per ounce.
Since our long-term forecast places gold eventually as high as $3000 to $3500 per ounce, we believe IAMGOLD has the potential to trade above the 2011 highs, possibly well beyond. Although we consider the shares to be speculative, valuations appear to be reasonable.
The shares currently trade at roughly a 1.5 price to sales ratio and the forward price to earnings ratio is about 26. Total cash per share is $1.53 while total debt per shares is $0.89.
IAMGOLD rallied from similar levels in March 2017, almost doubling to as high as $7.22 in September 2017, despite bullion rising only modestly by 3%, thus there is potential for investors and speculators to drive interest regardless of the action in the precious metal.
However, there have been some hiccups along the way. Most recently, IAMGOLD traded as low as $2.85 last November and has rallied since but likely faces some resistance above $4 per share. 
We have some reservations about management, but our long-term forecast for gold bullion alone should be capable of driving the stock's value over the long term.

1501,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- AbbVie Inc. ABBV,"The population is aging at warp speed. A combination of longer lives and lower fertility rates have made the US and global populations older than ever before, forecasts Tom Hutchinson, a leading income expert and editor of Cabot Dividend Investor.
About a third of the US population is already over 50, and they won’t be getting any younger. In fact, the fastest growing segment of the population is 65 and older as an average of 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every single day. 
What does this mean? It means you’re likely to get stuck behind drivers who pull out onto the middle of the road and become stumped. But it also means that healthcare will be a booming growth industry, as older people simply require a lot more of it. That’s a beautiful thing because the sector is already defensive and adding the growth quotient makes it irresistible.
There’s a lot of ways to play healthcare. You can invest in everything from high-flying biotechnology companies to the more stodgy big pharmaceutical companies. I like a company that combines both — the stability and high dividend yield of big pharma and the rapid growth of biotechnology.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a US-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in cutting edge small molecule drugs. The company was spun off from pharmaceutical giant Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) in 2013, but has already eclipsed its former parent company in size and is now the eighth largest drug company in the world.
Since the stock’s IPO on December 21, 2012 it has provided a phenomenal average annual return of 20%. An initial $10,000 investment would now be worth over $31,000, with dividends reinvested. The dividend has more than doubled since 2014 and ABBV now yields a big fat 5%.
The rapid growth has been achieved from its blockbuster biologic auto immune drug Humira, which is the world’s number one drug by far with annual sales of over $20 billion. Humira accounts for over 50% of sales and faces increasing competition that will erode market share. However, AbbVie has a spectacular pipeline of new drugs that should more than offset the slippage.
According to market research firm EvaluatePharma, Abbvie has the second most valuable clinical pipeline across all of biopharma. It has 20 new products slated for launch by 2020 and 15 drugs and treatments that are already currently already in phase 3, the last step before the approval process. 
Earnings over the next five years are expected to be even better than the last five. With a yield of 5.0%, the stock has a spectacular track record and offers more growth and a higher dividend than any other big drug company.

1502,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Global Brass and Copper Holdings BRSS,"Copper has a tendency to make a major seasonal bottom in December and then a tendency to post major seasonal peaks in April or May, explains seasonal timing expert Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of Stock Trader's Almanac.
This pattern could be due to the buildup of inventories by miners and manufacturers as the construction season begins in late-winter to early-spring. Auto makers are also preparing for the new car model year that often begins in mid- to late-summer.
One way we like to gain exposure to copper and its seasonally strong period is through the highly correlated stocks of companies that mine and produce copper.
Global Brass and Copper Holdings (BRSS) is our favorite small cap stock that is highly correlated to copper. Copper’s rout in 2018 caught up with the company, but it has held up better than other stocks in the copper arena because of its use of recycled materials and the value-added nature of their products.
Plus it pays a 1.4% dividend. This company primarily operates in the U.S. as a converter, fabricator and processor of copper and brass products.
Global brass is not a mining company; they are essentially a recycler that produces sheet, strip, foil, rod, tube and similar products from processed scrap, used copper cathodes and other refined metal sources. Although based in the U.S., the company also has some operations in China, Japan, United Kingdom and Germany.
With copper appearing to set its perennial seasonal low in December and Global Brass and Copper's solid business, they are well positioned to drive growth organically as well as through acquisitions. The stock is recommended for risk-oriented investors.

1503,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Sproutly SPR,"Sproutly (CSX (NASDAQ:CSX): SPR) — a high risk idea that is traded on the Canadian securities exchange — aims to be a vertically integrated cannabis consumer products company, suggests Jimmy Mengel, editor of The Crow's Nest.
The company is bringing together pharma-grade cultivation, secured distribution solutions, and advanced technologies to redefine the cannabis industry.
They have patents pending for water-soluble cannabis ingredients. Currently companies use butane or CO2 to scorch the cannabis pant in order to extract oil for smoking, edibles and other products.
Oil is not soluble and is difficult to properly infuse into edible products. Our bodies simply don't process them quickly or efficiently. Water, on the other hand, is much easier and cleaner for such uses.
Sproutly is on the cutting edge of beverage based cannabis technology. Cannabis beverage sales quietly raked in over $35 million last year. That's only including legal states like California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. We've seen double-digit growth over the past three years. As more states legalize marijuana, these numbers are going to go crazy.
But perhaps the most important part for investors is that big beverage companies are already placing their bets and planning massive buyouts of small companies. We've already seen that when Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) — which sells Corona and Modelo beer, Svedka vodka, and other big brands, ponied up around $191 million for a 9.9% stake in Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC).
Sproutly could be a prime buy-out target for large companies looking into the next wave of marijuana profits, especially in the booming cannabis beverage market. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and both actively searching for cannabis stocks, and I believe Sproutly is one of the best under-the-radar options for such a merger.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",Apple cuts current-quarter production plan for new iPhones by 10 percent: Nikkei,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which slashed its quarterly sales forecast last week, has reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday.
That rare forecast cut exposed weakening iPhone demand in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States.
Many analysts and consumers have said the new iPhones are overpriced.
Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request. 
The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets.
Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12 percent in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3 percent, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014.
Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March period, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation.
Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report comes after chip suppliers  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and  Skyworks Solutions Inc  (O:SWKS) flagged weak first-quarter chip demand for smartphones.
Samsung surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to ""ease confusion"" among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown.
Apple's iPhone suppliers include Taiwanese assemblers  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) and  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938). Pegatron declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters, while Foxconn did not reply to a request for comment.
There was little reaction to the report among shares of major Apple suppliers, as the market has already digested production cuts after the iPhone maker's forecast cut, analysts said.
Shares of Foxconn, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer, closed up 1.6 percent, while Pegatron closed up 1.3 percent. Apple shares were up 1.3 percent at $152.70 in early trading on Wednesday.
Among iPhone component suppliers in Asia, South Korea's  LG Display  Co Ltd (KS:034220) closed up 0.5 percent, while  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) was flat.
""The Street is already well aware of a soft March guide so this latest report is not a new worry, as investors are starting to look ahead 6-9 months down the road for Apple and gauge how the company emerges from this dark chapter of soft demand,"" Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.
As Chinese demand has faltered, Apple has increased focus on India, which recently overtook the United States as the world's second-largest smartphone market.
Chief Executive Tim Cook reiterated in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that India was a major focus for Apple.

Reuters reported last month that Apple will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India this year through the local unit of Foxconn, citing a person familiar with the matter.

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 06:19AM ET</span>",EU expected to clear steel import curb after Trump tariffs,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries are expected to next week approve a scheme to limit imports of steel into the bloc following U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum entering the United States.
The vote on Jan. 16 would put in place an effective cap on steel imports for three years to counter concerns of EU producers that European markets could be flooded by steel products that are no longer being imported into the U.S..
The bloc imposed ""safeguard"" measures on a provisional basis on imports of 23 steel product types in July, with an expiry date of Feb 4. The quota was set at the average level of imports over the past three years, with a 25 percent tariff applied if the quotas are filled.
The temporary measures won widespread backing from EU member countries, with only two abstaining. 
""There is more scepticism than at the provisional stage. Steel users have been affected... but I expect there will be enough countries in favor to push the safeguards through,"" one EU diplomat said.
The Commission's proposal is similar to the provisional measures, although quotas would be set at the average of the last three years plus 5 percent. It has also set limits for major exporting countries. The quotas would apply for three-month periods in order to limit stockpiling and could be increased by 5 percent each year.
European auto manufacturers association ACEA called the measures protectionist and said they would harm its members. It added that steel exports to the United States had only dropped slightly and so little extra steel was being diverted to Europe.
Steel group Eurofer, whose members include world number one ArcelorMittal and Germany's ThyssenKrupp, previously welcomed the safeguards. 

The main exporters of steel to the EU are China, India, Russia, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark broke a fresh three-week high, up 0.9 percent by 0951 GMT, while the UK's FTSE (FTSE) hit its highest in five weeks, up 0.8 percent, and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 1.1 percent.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] on Wednesday said it had sold a majority stake in a Manhattan building in a $422 million deal, the latest in a slew of asset disposals undertaken by the group to ease an intensifying cash crunch.
HNA did not give details of the buyer, but a spokesman for the group confirmed the verity of a report by U.S. real estate news website Bisnow that earlier reported the sale of 850 Third Avenue and the deal value.
The website said the building had been acquired by Jacob Chetrit and his sons, Michael and Simon, citing statements from Michael Chetrit and MHP Real Estate Services. 
MHP and another real estate investment firm ATCO Properties & Management sold their minority stakes in the building as part of the deal, the report said. 
The report also pegged the deal value at $422 million, citing one unnamed source.
HNA in 2016 bought a 90 percent stake in the building, valued at $463 million, months before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president.
The U.S. government had ordered HNA to sell its stake in the building, whose tenants include a police precinct tasked with protecting Trump Tower, the Wall Street Journal reported in August.
Embattled HNA Group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the company stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets.
But faced with soaring debt and government scrutiny of aggressive dealmaking, HNA has pushed ahead with asset sales that have included real estate and stakes in hotels groups, and discussions on key overseas units such as Ingram Micro and its luxury $300 million-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"".
The group met bankers on Tuesday to tout a range of new assets for sale, spanning a hotel project in frozen Harbin and stakes in struggling online lender Dianrong, insurer Bohai Life and brokerage HNA Futures.

Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] was leading a team to supervise asset disposals as the group looks to scale back operations to just core assets.

Pumped hydro storage plants could be used as reservoirs when demand is low and as hydro power stations to generate electricity when consumption picks up.
The five plants, located in the provinces of Jilin, Hebei, Shandong and Zhejiang, and far west region of Xinjiang, will have a combined capacity of 6 gigawatts (GW) and are expected to be launched by 2026, the State Grid Corp said in a statement on Wednesday.
The state-backed company currently has 19.23 GW of pumped hydro storage capacity and 30.15 GW under construction.
The investment came as China has vowed to boost large-scale energy storage capacity over the next decade and launch at least 40 GW of pumped hydro storage plants by 2020.
Energy storage facilities, including pumped hydro storage plants, compressed air energy storage and bulk storage with batteries, could help prevent renewable power from being wasted when there is not enough transmission capacity to absorb the electricity.
Wind waste rates stood at 8.7 percent in China in the first half of 2018, while solar waste reached 3.6 percent, according to data from the National Energy Administration.
Regions in the western and northeastern part of China, including Xinjiang and Jilin, are identified with the highest rate of renewable energy wastage.

With a risk-free rate of 2.4 percent on three-month T-bills, “cash represents a competitive asset,” with allocations likely near the lowest levels in 30 years for many investors, analysts including chief strategist David Kostin wrote in a research note Tuesday.
The bank recommended investors reduce holdings in bonds this year and remain invested in equities. Though U.S. stocks could come under further pressure, the Goldman strategists said they expect “positive U.S. economic growth will support continued earnings growth.”
“The potential exists for further equity market downside in the near term even if the recent equity market collapse does not lead to a recession,” the strategists wrote. “There have been four bear markets without a recession since 1946. During these episodes, the S&P 500 declined by an average of 21 percent for a period of 8 months. If the current episode follows that historical pattern, the S&P 500 could fall further in the next couple of months.”
Money market funds received $165 billion of inflows in November and December, the highest two-month flow since 2008, according to the note. In contrast, there were $42 billion of outflows from stock funds as investors “aggressively” rotated from equities into cash, the analysts wrote.
After a rocky 2018, U.S. stocks have rallied and bonds steadied so far this year as investors price in lower Federal Reserve rates for the first time in more than a decade.
Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for 10-year Treasury yields earlier this week by 50 basis points to 3 percent, saying they may have peaked for this cycle.

Xiaomi says its CEO Lei Jun and other controlling shareholders Smart Mobile Holdings Limited and Smart Player Limited voluntarily agreed to not dispose of any shares of the company for a further period of 365 days starting from January 9. The move was taken “for the purpose of expressing their confidence in the long term value of the company”.
However, the news did not help boost Xiaomi’s share price, which instead dropped 4.7% to HK$10.58 by 1:46 AM ET (06:46 GMT), hitting a new low.
About 19% or more than three billion shares in the company became free to be traded today after a six-month lock-up period.
Since its high-profile IPO on July 9, 2018 that set the offer price at HK$17, Xiaomi’s share price has been plummeting. According to media reports, the company positions itself as an internet company but relies heavily on hardware to generate revenue, raising concerns among the investors. The continuing U.S.-China trade war was also cited as a catalyst for the selling in the company.

The dollar dipped.
China and Hong Kong stocks led gains on news of further stimulus efforts. Futures on the S&P 500 reached their highs of the session after an Oval Office address by President Donald Trump yielded no new moves in his dispute with Congress over funding a wall on the Mexican border; there had been speculation of a polarizing declaration of a national emergency. European futures indicated markets there will rise. Ten-year Treasury yields retained gains made in recent days. Oil held above $50 a barrel in New York.
Developments in U.S.-China trade relations remain a focal point, with Trump increasingly eager to strike a deal to help perk up financial markets, people familiar with White House deliberations told Bloomberg. The current round of sub-ministerial talks are expected to conclude Wednesday.

Meantime, Trump demanded in his televised address that Congress provide billions more for border security. Democratic leaders of Congress rebuffed the request, saying the matter should be considered independently of annual appropriations for the federal government, parts of which continue to be shut thanks to the impasse over funding.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",China's approval of DowDuPont soy poses challenge to Bayer,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - China's approval of imports of a DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP) genetically modified soybean puts rival  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) on the defensive, investors and analysts said, as U.S. farmers will have a new choice when planting their most valuable agricultural export.
Bayer-owned  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) has long dominated the $40 billion U.S. soybean market. The market has opened up, though, as Monsanto's Roundup Ready line of seeds - engineered to tolerate the weed killer glyphosate - has lost effectiveness as weeds develop tolerance to the chemical.
China cleared the way for U.S. farmers to eventually plant DowDuPont's Enlist E3 soybeans, which can resist three herbicides, by approving imports of the crop on Tuesday. 
For years, the company had postponed launching the seeds while waiting for the nod from Beijing. China bought about 60 percent of U.S. soy exports, worth about $12 billion, prior to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and could reject shipments of unapproved varieties.
Farmers have struggled since China imposed a tariff on imports of U.S. soy in July as part of the trade war, in which the world's two biggest economies have slapped billions of dollars of retaliatory duties on each other's products.
Michael Underhill, chief investment officer of Capital Innovations, which owns shares of DowDuPont, said China's approval of Enlist E3 soy will eventually lead to big orders for the company.
""When I think about how big of a deal this is, I think about the Led Zeppelin song 'When the Levee Breaks,'"" Underhill said. ""Competition is going to get fierce. It forces everyone to get sharp and up their game."" 
Enlist E3 soybeans are bred to resist the herbicides glyphosate, glufosinate and 2,4-D.
The seeds will challenge Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans developed by Monsanto, which can resist glyphosate and a newer version of a chemical called dicamba. 
Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture unit of DowDuPont, said it was happy the regulatory approval of its seed traits was progressing in China. A spokesman did not respond to requests for more information.
Bayer spokesman Darren Wallis said in an e-mailed statement that Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans were the number one trait platform in the market. The company complained of China's slow regulatory approvals process in an earlier statement.
U.S. farmers planted Xtend soybeans on about 45 percent of soy acres in 2018. Bayer, which bought Monsanto for about $63 billion last year, says dicamba and Xtend seeds work well to control weeds. 
But Cleveland Research Company said last month in a report seen by Reuters that within a few years of launching, the Enlist platform of herbicides and chemical resistant seeds could win a comparable market share to Bayer's Xtend platform.
""We envision Xtend's U.S. soybean market share eroding several years out as Corteva pushes its own Enlist platform,"" the report said.
DowDuPont developed Enlist E3 soybeans with a smaller seed company called MS Technologies, said Harry Stine, the chief executive of Stine Seed who is affiliated with MS Technologies.
Enlist E3 soy will probably not be fully launched in the United States this year because it is still missing approval from another market, the Philippines, Stine said. However, he expects substantial U.S. plantings of the seed in 2020.
Enlist E3 soy may find an opening with farmers unhappy with Bayer's dicamba-resistant Xtend soybeans. Monsanto has been sued by farmers who say dicamba drifts away from where it is sprayed and damages nearby fruits, vegetables and other crops that cannot tolerate the chemical. 
Enlist E3 soybeans can be sprayed with an herbicide based on the chemical 2,4-D.
""It does not drift at all,"" Stine said about the Enlist herbicide. ""That's what sets it apart from other things.""
Richard Wilkins, a Delaware farmer who grows about 400 acres of soybeans and a former chairman of the American Soybean Association, has not planted Xtend soybeans because of the risk of dicamba damaging nearby vegetables. 
He said he would ask his seed supplier whether Enlist E3 soy is available and may plant it to control marestail, a weed that has developed some resistance to glyphosate
""If there are some varieties that will work on any of my farm, then I probably will give it a try,"" he said about Enlist E3 soy. 
Missouri farmer Milas Mainord said he, too, would consider planting Enlist E3 soy but wanted more information. He is planning to plant soybeans from Bayer and rival BASF (DE:BASFn) on some of his 5,500 acres this spring.

""The main thing we would want before we open ourselves up to Enlist is some history with it and what kind of yield to expect out of it,"" Mainord said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The high-yield ""junk"" bond market, which has been a leading indicator of recessions, is flashing ""yellow now,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, said on Tuesday.
Gundlach, who oversees more than $121 billion of assets under management, said on an investor webcast that the signal ""may be ... a false positive,"" but ""this is something we're going to have to watch very, very carefully.""
Gundlach said the current buy-the-dip mentality reminds him of the complacency that took place in the 2007-2008 credit market right before the great financial crisis. 
""There's potential for that here. Because the panic in December was a buying panic - not a selling panic - you never saw the VIX truly spike the way you want for a panic. You want to see that thing over 40. It never made it to 40."" 
The CBOE volatility index, which is known as the VIX and which is often seen as an investor fear gauge, stands around 20.50 points. 
Gundlach said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pivoted from pragmatism to a ""Powell Put"" - that the Fed under his leadership will act like an options contract to prevent stocks from falling too much. 
Powell said on Friday that the U.S. central bank ""wouldn't hesitate"" to adjust how quickly it lets its balance sheet shrink if it starts to cause problems in financial markets. Powell also said the Fed ""will be patient"" with monetary policy as it watches how the U.S. economy performs.
Since those remarks, the U.S. stock ""market has been throwing a party,"" Gundlach said. 
On Friday, when markets were also boosted by a monthly U.S. jobs report that blew past forecasts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.3 percent while the S&P 500 index advanced 3.4 percent. Both the Dow and S&P added to gains Monday and Tuesday.
Gundlach said the ballooning U.S. federal government debt is ""a completely horrific situation"" and that the United States could be at a ""tipping point"" in a ""debt-compounding cycle.""
""Are we growing at all or is it all just the increase in debt?"" Gundlach asked. 
Gundlach on Dec. 11 said that the next move in the dollar was lower and that the S&P 500 index would fall below its February 2018 lows. Both predictions turned out to be accurate. 
The DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, which Gundlach manages, surpassed 97 percent of its peers in 2018, according to Morningstar data.

A South Korean court on Tuesday approved a request by plaintiffs in a wartime forced labor case to seize part of the local assets of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp, Yonhap News Agency said, citing a court official.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference the court decision was ""extremely regrettable"" and the government took the situation seriously. 
The relevant Japanese ministers would gather on Wednesday afternoon to discuss how to respond, he said.
""We plan to request the South Korean government for consultation,"" based on a 1965 treaty that normalized ties between the neighbors, Suga added. 
Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp said it had not received a document from the South Korean court.
""We will consult with Japanese government and take an appropriate measure,"" a company spokeswoman said.
She reiterated that there was no change in the company's stance that all matters concerning wartime reparations were settled under the 1965 agreements between the two nations. 
Ties between the Asian neighbors have been frosty since a South Korean court ruling in October that Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp should pay 100 million won ($90,500) to each of four South Koreans in a World War Two forced labor case. 
Japan has urged South Korea to take appropriate steps to avoid measures unfair to Japanese companies. 

The South Korean court's decision could further complicate ties between the two nations, embroiled in a dispute over whether a South Korean warship had locked its targeting radar on a Japanese patrol plane last month.

1529,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>","Trump Wants Trade Deal With China to Boost Stocks, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is increasingly eager to strike a deal with China soon in an effort to perk up financial markets that have slumped on concerns over the trade war, according to people familiar with internal White House deliberations.
Talks between mid-level U.S. and Chinese officials in Beijing were extended for a third day into Wednesday, adding to optimism fueled by tweets from Trump that the two sides are making progress toward an agreement. The U.S. delegation were seen carrying their luggage with them as they left their hotel for the negotiations on Wednesday morning.
Inside the White House, some key economic advisers are campaigning for a quick resolution to the trade conflict to help soothe battered markets. The S&P 500 Index has fallen about 8 percent since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a 90-day truce at a Dec. 1 meeting in Argentina.
“Talks with China are going very well!,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday, the latest in a series of upbeat messages from him on the negotiations since both his meeting with Xi and the December market turmoil.
U.S. stock-index futures climbed during the Asia trading day with March contracts on the S&P 500 Index gaining as much as 0.5 percent.
According to people familiar with the matter, Trump’s willingness to cut a deal with Beijing is driven in large part by his desire for markets to rally. He publicly said he’s eager to make a deal that benefits both sides while also stressing that China’s slowing economy and falling stock market signal the country is more desperate than the U.S. for a speedy outcome.
Still, talks between the world’s two biggest economies have repeatedly yielded no breakthroughs since they started in May, and Beijing has repeatedly said it won’t cave to U.S. demands.
March Deadline
The USTR’s press office declined to comment.
The two countries have until March 1 before U.S. tariffs on some $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent.
The president has focused on the stock market as it’s fallen over the past month as a gauge of success or failure, expressing frustration at the volatility, the people said.
China hawks in the administration have grown increasingly concerned about how the market turbulence has been affecting the president’s mood on trade. In public statements aides like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, have played down the impact of the trade wars on markets, the U.S. economy and companies.
In private, some administration officials have confessed frustration in recent weeks with the market declines, appearing bemused by investors’ concerns over the China trade wars and how to address them.
Trade Abuses
But hawks have also been pressing the president to keep his focus on what they see as a long-term fight to address a vast list of Chinese trade abuses and make sure lasting changes in policy are both secured and can be enforced.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who Trump appointed to lead the China talks, is pressing for the U.S. to take a harder line in the negotiations. He is pushing to address concerns of China’s alleged theft of intellectual property and market-access barriers, as well as to demand structural economic reforms.
Treasury officials have made the case that market volatility is in part due to the tightening of U.S. monetary policy, and a result of the trade war with China. Advocates of a quick deal with Beijing, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, have used the markets jitters as a cudgel to press their case, the people said.
“We’re on our way to a deal. There is no question that the Chinese want the deal, they need the deal. Their economy is slowing much more than I think public data is showing right now,” Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, said on Bloomberg TV Tuesday. “There’s many in the White House who would like a longer fight, but for now the president has set the tone, and he says he wants a deal. So we’re on our way.”

1530,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 09:21PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Jump as U.S., China Narrow Differences on Trade","Investing.com - Asian markets jumped in morning trade on Wednesday after China and the U.S. reportedly narrowed their differences on trade.
Talks between the two countries were extended for a third day, according to various media, which added that negotiators made progress on issues including the purchase of U.S. goods and services. While the two sides have not yet reached a deal, they are likely to hold a follow-up conversation later this month, the reports added.
""Hopes on U.S.-China trade talks are helping. Some sort of deals are likely to increase Chinese imports of natural gas, soybeans and so on from the U.S. Yet, it should be hard to resolve more structural issues such as intellectual property rights,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
U.S. President Donald Trump is said to be eager to strike a deal with Beijing in an effort to support the equity markets, CNBC reported citing people familiar with internal White House deliberations.
“Talks with China are going very well!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
The new round of talks began on Monday as Beijing and Washington hoped to reach an agreement before a March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on some $200 billion in Chinese goods would rise to 25% from 10%.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.6% and 1.8% by 9:21 PM ET (02:21 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged 2.4% following the news.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 1.2% higher. South Korea’s KOSPI was up 1.7%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.8%.
In other news, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is cutting production for the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR models by about 10% for the March quarter.
The news came one week after the company reduced its quarterly sales forecast."
1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 08:35PM ET</span>",Factbox: What can the state of California do about PG&E?,"(Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) is exploring filing some or all of its business for bankruptcy protection as it could face billions of dollars in potential liabilities if it is held responsible for fatal wildfires in 2018 and 2017, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Trouble for PG&E also means trouble for California, which relies on PG&E to provide power to 5.4 million customers and make the investments necessary to shore up its system of wires and poles and mitigate the risk of future fires. PG&E is also a key player in helping California meet its ambitious climate goals.
Here are a few of the options California could consider to shore up the utility:
A DO-OVER OF LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRE LEGISLATION
California policymakers could extend assistance provided in a bill passed last year that allows utilities to raise rates to recover some of the costs related to wildfires. The law mitigates liability from fires in 2017 and others starting in 2019, but made no provision for fires last year.
The move would give PG&E an outlet for recovering billions of dollars in potential liabilities from last year's fires, but might not be enough to assuage deep investor concerns about its long-term financial health given the increasing regularity of catastrophic fires. Insurance claims from the Camp Fire that erupted on Nov. 8 in PG&E's service territory have topped $7 billion and are expected to grow.
""I don't know that that would be enough to put the company in capital markets access, which is where they need to be,"" said Michael Wara, a scholar focused on climate and energy policy at Stanford Law School.
It also may be a challenge politically, particularly since public and legislative sentiment has soured since the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said last month it is considering penalties against PG&E for falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines.
""I am not interested in another piece of legislation that allows them to pass cost off to the ratepayers for these liabilities,"" Assemblyman James Gallagher said in an interview on Saturday. ""We need a much bigger shake-up and reform.""
Ratepayers are already bracing for higher rates due to the increased risks from wildfires. PG&E last month asked the CPUC for a $1.1 billion rate increase, more than half of which would be for wildfire prevention and risk reduction.
The CPUC could possibly interpret last year's law to include 2018, or new legislation could be passed. A legislative solution would likely be faster.
Asked about PG&E's fate at a news conference on Tuesday, California's new governor, Gavin Newsom, said, ""I'm not going to make news on that."" But he said he'd had a meeting on the subject at 8:00 a.m. 
State lawmakers said they are leery of responding to PG&E's bankruptcy threat too quickly, saying they have lost their trust in the company.
""I don't know if I can trust this information,"" State Sen. Bill Dodd said in an interview. ""It's really too bad that their credibility has been shattered so gravely. That just puts us and the legislature in a position where we are going to take the time that's necessary to do this and to do it right."" 
DIRECT SUPPORT
California could intervene directly by providing credit support for future debt financings or municipalizing all or some utility assets,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Stephen Byrd said.
If the utility became state-owned, California would assume all future wildfire risk, Byrd wrote in a client note last week. One scenario would be that the state takes over ownership of all of the electric distribution business and leaves the remaining businesses with shareholders. Byrd said this was the most bullish scenario for shareholders but added that it was unlikely that California would insulate shareholders from future wildfire liability while also giving them full value of the non-electric distribution businesses.
State ownership would not necessarily result in better maintenance of the utility's distribution system, said Catherine Sandoval, a professor at Santa Clara Law School and former CPUC commissioner.
""If you change to municipal control without changing the underlying dynamics of the maintenance and operation of the utility and its transmission network, you haven't really solved the problem,"" Sandoval said. 
State support for debt financing would result in a lower impact on consumer bills because all future wildfire liabilities would be absorbed by the remaining equity rate base in PG&E. This option would be less favorable for shareholders due to the threat of future fire liabilities.
A perceived bailout of PG&E is losing luster among legislators and regulators and is far from assured, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said when it stripped the company of its investment-grade rating late on Monday.
""Previously, we assumed that given California's robust renewable portfolio standards and the increasing risks of climate change, legislators and regulators would proactively work with the utility to preserve credit quality to achieve these goals,"" S&P Global analysts said in a note. ""However, based on recent developments, we no longer believe this to be true given the utility's own missteps.""
RESTRUCTURING VIA THE CPUC
The CPUC last month said it was considering a range of options for addressing PG&E's safety problems, including replacing some or all of its directors, splitting the utility's gas and electric divisions into separate companies, and reforming it into a publicly owned utility.
Since then, PG&E has said it is shaking up its board and reviewing its structure and corporate governance, but has not filed a specific plan with the CPUC.
The CPUC did not return a request for comment. 
UTILITY FAIL
California could allow PG&E to go bankrupt, for the second time in its history. 
Under that scenario, shareholders would be the big losers. But California could benefit if the utility installs new management and can rebuild trust in Sacramento and on Wall Street. The state would also have time to consider how to reduce the risk from the cost of increasingly devastating wildfires over the long term. 
""The fundamental problem is the utility at the current rate structure doesn't generate enough revenue to cover expenses"" from catastrophic wildfires, Stanford's Wara said. ""The utility's management has gotten understandably very focused on the short term... The most important thing the state could do is slow things down. One way that happens is in bankruptcy.""
Though PG&E can continue to operate in bankruptcy, ratepayers could still see higher bills. When PG&E went bankrupt in 2001 amid the state's energy crisis, California customers had to pay higher bills for years to help repay $13 billion owed to creditors. Another bankruptcy today could potentially lump individual claims from wildfires in with Wall Street's claims, possibly ballooning the payout and leaving victims to compete with creditors.
Dodd, the state senator, said on Monday that he would ask the state's Legislative Analyst's Office to assess the impact of a PG&E bankruptcy on ratepayers and fire victims.
""I wouldn't be surprised if a PG&E bankruptcy would lead to much higher rates for ratepayers and devastation for victims of previous wildfires,"" Dodd said. ""What we need to do is get some independent verification of what those numbers are and that will lead to a determination if legislation is necessary or not.""

PG&E spokesman Andy Castagnola said the utility would not comment.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",World Bank's Kim to join Global Infrastructure Partners,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim will join Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a private equity fund that invests in projects in wealthy and developing countries, the firm said on Tuesday, a day after Kim's shock resignation from the bank.
Kim, who joins New York-based GIP on Feb. 1 as a partner and vice chairman, has accepted a one-year ban from dealings with any World Bank units, including its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corp, a person familiar with his departure arrangements said.
A major part of the lender's work is lending to build infrastructure such as power, water and transportation projects in developing countries. Kim resigned more than three years before his term ends in 2022 amid differences with the Trump administration over climate change and the need for more development resources. 
Discussions between Kim and GIP about the new job came together about six weeks ago at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, the person said. Kim has emphasized that harnessing private sector investment funds was the key to building badly needed infrastructure amid constrained public budgets.
After securing a $13 billion capital increase last year and replenishments of the World Bank's donor fund for the poorest countries, Kim said on Monday in a note to staff that the opportunity ""is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets.""
The World Bank's board is expected to meet later this week to discuss the search for a successor to Kim.
While the United States has traditionally nominated the World Bank's leader, the tradition could be challenged, as it was when Kim's nomination by former president Barack Obama in 2012 was contested by candidates from Colombia and Nigeria, under an open nomination process that is still in place.

The United States holds an effective veto on the World Bank board, with about 16 percent of its total voting power, followed by Japan with about 6.9 percent and China with 4.5 percent.

1533,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>","Watching US Dollar Downtrend Today Amid Trade, JOLTs Reports","Everyone loves the entertainment of a tie-breaker with the sweaty palms of anxiety over the speculation for the winners and losers that permeates the air of this cold day for traders, writes Bob Savage Tuesday. He's presenting at TradersExpo New York March 11.
We are in the fifth day of trading for 2019 and the volatility; uncertainty of policy and economic growth continues to hang over the nascent recovery in asset prices.
Overnight positive comments on U.S./China trade continued but politics elsewhere start to matter – North Korea Kim visits Xi for their fourth summit.
South Korea Moon reshuffles his cabinet as his approval ratings fell to record low 45.9%.
Confidence in Japanese consumers fell again, German industrial production fell again – making clear German growth in 4Q will be near zero, while EU confidence across the economy fell more than expected.
The markets may be holding better than the news headlines today – especially in forex where the euro (EUR) and British pound (GBP) are not yet reflecting the pain to the U.S. dollar (USD). The dollar weakness in 2019 maybe about the only connection back to 2018 that rhymes as U.S. negative outlooks on growth, rate spreads, politics and capital flows remain mired in doubt despite the clear recovery of technicals in the S&P 500 (SPX).
The correlation of the weaker USD to better U.S. moods might matter a bit to those looking for other tie-breaking scenarios give the bid today. The USD nascent downtrend has further to go if you believe the chart and not the economic data differentials but today looks like an important tie-breaker risk with 96 the pivot and 96.80 key break.
Today’s trade and JOLTs report seem unlikely to matter much in the bigger competition for investors’ money and confidence but they may lead the USD and foreshadow the year ahead.

1534,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",How to Use a Simple Short-Term Options Hedge on Real Estate,"Undoubtedly, most investors were hoping that the first rally of the New Year was going to stick around for more than just a few days. The jury is still out whether or not the market is going to continue its bearish trend, writes Jay Soloff Tuesday. He's presenting at MoneyShow Orlando Feb. 7-8.
But, the surprising news from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) certainly casts a shadow over the brief glimmer of hope from investors.
In case you missed it, AAPL preannounced poor earnings based on slower than expected sales – primarily in China. The company lowered revenue guidance for the first time in 12 years and it sent a ripple through the markets. If one of the largest companies in the world is struggling, what’s that mean for everyone else?
It does seem to show that the trade/tariff war between the U.S. and China is having real consequences on American companies. AAPL shares dropped 10% on the day after the announcement, with the S&P 500 pulling back 2.5%. Once again, that’s not the day bulls were hoping for after several up days in a row.
Given all the uncertainty in the market these days, it’s important for investors to understand the value of hedging. That is, every investor who owns stocks should know how to protect against downside risk. This includes those holding single stocks, ETFs, index funds and other mutual funds.
Essentially, downside risk can be hedged with any asset that makes money as the market goes down. It’s a way to counter the losses you may incur from your long stock/fund positions. The easiest way to do this is with inverse ETFs and options.
Both inverse ETFs and options (long puts) are easy enough to implement as hedges. I’m going to focus on options in this article.
In most cases, simply buying a put option on the asset you want protected is all you need to do. A put option will only cost a fraction of the cost of the stock, so even if you lose money on the put (which is preferable) you won’t sacrifice your upside return all that much (in most cases). And since options use leverage, if your put pays off, it can cover most or all of your losses on the asset on a down move.
It’s easier to look at a hedge through an example. So, here’s an actual hedge trade against real-estate stocks that recently hit the tape. By the way, that’s the beauty of an options hedge. You can pick the time frame you want, while protecting against any sort of asset class – as long as it has an ETF available (which is pretty much all of them).
The trade I’m referring to occurred in iShares US Real Estate ETF (IYR). With IYR at $74, the trader purchased the January 11th 71.5 put for $0.32. This is essentially a one-week hedge that protects against the real estate ETF falling below $71 (technically $71.18 is the breakeven point).
The trader bought about 7,000 of these puts for roughly $220,000 in premium, which is also the max loss on the trade. However, if the market sells off sharply over the next week and takes real estate stocks down with it, the hedge will really pay off.
As a matter of fact, for every $1 below the breakeven point, the hedge will generate about $700,000. If you’re concerned about a short-term drop in real estate stock prices, this is a really good method of protecting your portfolio. Paying just $0.32 per option is a reasonable price to pay for downside protection for a week, especially given how volatile the market has been the last several months.

1535,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",US Dollar- Why 2019 Could Break Bulls' Hearts,"The pendulum of market sentiment has shifted from extreme bearishness with low expectations to extreme bullishness with high expectations, potentially setting up dollar bulls for disappointment, notes Matt Weller.
The pendulum of market sentiment swings ever back and forth between fear and greed, euphoria and despondency. Lately, it seems like the time it takes to shift from one to the other is about a year, at least when it comes to the world’s reserve currency.
Back when we flipped our calendars from 2017 to 2018, longer-term positioning data showed that traders were extremely bearish on the U.S. dollar’s prospects following a disappointing year for the world’s reserve currency, making it a smart contrarian bet to look for strength in the greenback.
As it turns out, the buck fell against every one of its major rivals except for the yen, and traders are once again betting on continued dollar strength. According to the CFTC’s Commitment of Traders (COT) report, speculative futures traders are long the U.S. Dollar Index to the tune of nearly 40,000 contracts, which is near the highs from May 2017 and approaching the most bullish level since 2015.
Fundamentally speaking, the U.S. economy may be the proverbial “best house in a bad global neighborhood,” but with the U.S. yield curve flattening, fiscal stimulus from last year’s tax cut fading, and “trade war” tariffs starting to take a bite out of economic activity, the Fed will likely have to tap the brakes on further interest rate increases in 2019.
Conversely, the market’s expectations for any progress from other G7 economies and central banks are extraordinarily low. While those subdued outlooks may indeed come to pass, the odds favor a better-than-expected year for some of the dollar’s major rivals, especially the euro and the yen, where traders have amassed their most bearish positions in over a year. In other words, we're presented with the mirror image scenario from the start of last year (which, in turn, was the mirror image of the situation at the start of 2017). The pendulum of market sentiment has shifted from extreme bearishness with low expectations to extreme bullishness with high expectations, potentially setting up dollar bulls for disappointment.
Technical View
As the chart below shows, the technical outlook for the dollar index has been deteriorating for the last couple of months. The index showed a triple bearish divergence with its RSI indicator through November and December, signaling waning momentum despite the marginal new highs in the value of the index itself.
Source: TradingView, FOREX.com
Now, DXY has formed a “rounded top” pattern to break below its bullish trend line, and the lagging MACD indicator is trending lower below both its signal line and the “0” level, showing that the momentum has shifted to the bears.
In the short term, bears have the upper hand and will likely look to sell any bounces back toward 97.00. To the downside, the next levels to watch will be the October and September lows near 95.00 and 94.00 respectively.
For more on the technical outlook for EUR/USD, the biggest component of the dollar index, see my colleague Fawad Razaqzada’s note “Could EUR/USD break higher?” from earlier today."
1536,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",Could EUR/USD break higher,"Some economists think the U.S. economy may have hit peak growth, which is bullish for the euro reports Fawad Razaqzada.
Although slightly lower today, the EUR/USD has been holding its own rather well despite continued weakness in Eurozone data. In part, the exchange rates resilience has been due to ongoing weakness in the dollar rather than euro strength as investors have been lowering their expectations over further interest rate increases in the United States, while Eurozone interest rate expectations haven’t moved much recently. While we are unsure about the longer-term direction of the EUR/USD, we think there is a possibility that the exchange rate could appreciate further in the short-term outlook.
The recent sell-off in the stock markets underscore concerns over economic growth, as do the disappointing sales forecasts from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and now Samsung (KS:005930) for their smartphones. Demand has been hit by the recent currency crisis in several emerging market economies, the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports and tighter monetary conditions in the United States, among other factors.
Although employment growth is still strong and wages have picked up, some economists think the U.S. economy may have hit peak growth as the impact of the past tax cuts start to fade away. The Federal Reserve has indicated it wants to pause hiking and assess the economic situation before deciding whether to tighten its belt further. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank continues to expect lifting interest rates after the summer, should economic conditions still warrant it.
Also painting a moderately bullish picture for the EUR/USD is the fact that the German-US 10-year bond yield spread has widened in favor of Germany (see chart below). Yield-seeking investors are finding European assets marginally more valuable than U.S. assets, underpinning demand for the single currency. In fact, the yield spread has created a divergence as it has made a higher high, while the EUR/USD hasn’t created a corresponding higher high yet. This is a major warning sign for the EUR/USD bears as it indicates the exchange rate may have catching up to do. Note that the previous divergences saw the EUR/USD eventually go in the direction of the yield spread. What makes this particular divergence even more interesting is the fact that the EUR/USD has held its own above long-term support around the 1.13 handle and created a couple of interesting price candles on its monthly chart.
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com.
So, the potential is there for a breakout on the EUR/USD despite all the doom and gloom out there. But overall, price action on this pair is still (understandably) choppy and range bound. Conservative traders may therefore wish to wait for more signals to emerge before taking a directional view on the EUR/USD. Friday’s US CPI and next Tuesday’s Brexit vote in the UK parliament are among the most important short-term catalysts for this pair. "
1537,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>","The Quant Cycle Indicator Forecasts Moves in the Nasdaq 100, Crude, and the Long Bond","John Rawlins’ Quant Cycle indicator is showing major moves ahead. Here we share upcoming moves and recent accurate predictions.
Quant Cycles is a technical tool that employs proprietary statistical techniques and complex algorithms to filter multiple cycles from historical data, combines them to obtain cyclical information from price data and then gives a graphical representation of their predictive behavior (center line forecast). Other proprietary frequency techniques are then employed to obtain the cycles embedded in the prices.
The upper and lower bands of the oscillator represent a two-standard deviation move from the predictive price band and is indicative of extreme overbought/oversold conditions.
Recent Success
On Dec. 24, the Quant Cycle indicated that the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) have moved firmly into overbought territory, while the cycle still showed the VIX would experience downward momentum (see Chart). This is a major sell signal as the indicator is showing a downward bias just as the VIX is extremely overbought.
The following chart from Jan. 4 shows how the market reacted in the 10 days following that Dec. 24 bearish outlook.
Dow move
On Dec. 24, the Quant Cycle indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed and would be moving higher the following four to six weeks. However, the market continued to weaken, pushing it into extreme oversold territory (see chart).
The above chart is an extremely bullish set up. The trader has two things in his or her favor: The market is extremely oversold and the indicator is predicting the Dow will move higher over the next four to six weeks. See what happened.
What now?
Take a look at the Jan. 7 daily Quant Cycle in crude oil (below). You can see that it was a little bit early in predicting the bottom of the crude oil sell-off, but forecasts crude to continue on its upward correction for the next two months. This is telling you to 1) get out of shorts, 2) stay long if you are long, and 3) it is not too late in the move to get long.
Long Bond
The Jan. 7 Quant Cycle chart on the 30-year Treasury bond shows the long bond hitting overbought territory in the first week of January after an indication that the cycle reversed lower in the second half of December. Couple that would the reversal on Jan. 3 and there is clear sell signal for the long bond. The Quant Cycle is forecasting that the 30-year will continue to head lower for the next two weeks.
Nasdaq 100
Perhaps the sharpest signal by the Quant Cycle is in the Nasdaq 100 on a weekly basis. While the Quant Cycle was early in predicting a market bottom in the Nasdaq, that allowed the market to touch oversold territory just as it is calling for a sharp upward revision. This is a very bullish indicator, but because it is on a weekly timeframe the timing may not be as precise. Also, it would be wise to hold off putting a position on until after tonight’s presidential address that could disrupt equity markets."

The body said the oilfield deals with France's Maurel & Prom (PA:MAUP) and little-known U.S. company Erepla violated article 150 of Venezuela's constitution, which requires that contracts signed between the state and foreign companies be approved by the National Assembly, as Venezuela's congress is known.
""They are giving concessions that violate the law,"" said lawmaker Jorge Millan, mentioning the two contracts.
Congress, largely stripped of its power since the opposition took it over in 2016, is unlikely to be able block the deals from going forward. But the rejection could create legal complications under a future government.
Maduro is set to be inaugurated for his second consecutive term on Thursday following a May vote considered a sham by the domestic opposition and many foreign governments. A regional bloc of Latin American countries last week called on Maduro, a protege of the late Hugo Chavez, not to take office.
The deals are part of Maduro's effort to reverse a sharp decline in the OPEC nation's crude output that has crippled its economy. Erepla said it would invest up to $500 million in three fields, while Maurel & Prom said it would invest up to $400 million for a 40 percent stake in an oilfield joint venture.
PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Maurel & Prom did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours in France.
A spokesman for Erepla, registered in Delaware in November and part-owned by a prominent Florida Republican donor and shipping magnate, said Venezuela's hydrocarbons law ""allows PDVSA to contract with companies like Erepla to execute field services without any additional approvals required."" 
Referring to the Erepla deal during the congressional session earlier on Tuesday, Millan said that while PDVSA referred to the agreement as an oilfield service contract, ""the company will be conducting oil exploration and production activities.""
Maurel & Prom Chief Executive Michel Hochard said the company would act ""in accordance with the instructions given"" by Maduro and Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, according to a statement attributed to him in a PDVSA press release.

After Brexit, European carriers will have to show they are more than 50 per cent EU-owned and controlled to retain flying rights in the bloc, the FT said. 
IAG, which also owns the Spanish flag carrier Iberia, is registered in Spain but headquartered in the United Kingdom and has diverse global shareholders.
The FT said part of IAG's strategy to retain both EU and UK operating rights is to stress that its important individual airlines are domestically owned through a series of trusts and companies, rather than being part of the bigger group comprising a high proportion of non-EU investors.
The FT quoted an unnamed senior EU official as saying, ""For IAG, I can't see how it can be a solution.""
Concerns have been raised with IAG over its post-Brexit ownership structure, the FT quoted a second Brussels official familiar with the conversations as saying.

IAG was not immediately available for comment.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fiat Chrysler nearing U.S. diesel emissions settlement - source,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) is nearing a settlement to resolve the U.S. Justice Department's allegations that the Italian-American automaker used illegal software to allow 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles to pollute beyond legal limits, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
The settlement, which could be announced as early as this week, is expected to include significant civil fines and company funds to offset excess diesel emissions, the person said, and will cover claims from the Justice Department, U.S. states and vehicle owners.
The company, which declined to comment on Tuesday, has denied any wrongdoing and previously said there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. In October, Fiat Chrysler set aside 713 million euros ($815 million) to cover potential costs related to the case.
Reuters reported earlier that the Justice Department was seeking ""substantial"" civil fines from Fiat Chrysler after it sued in May 2017, accusing the company of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014.
Fiat Chrysler won approval from U.S. regulators in July 2017 to sell diesel vehicles with updated software. The company has repeatedly said it hoped to use that software as the basis of a fix to address agencies’ concerns over 2014-2016 Fiat Chrysler diesels.
The Justice Department declined to comment on Tuesday.
U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards.
VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving.
Reuters reported in February that a settlement offer sent to Fiat Chrysler lawyers by the Justice Department in January 2018 would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties.
The company and government lawyers have sparred for months over the size of penalties, the person said.
The Justice Department has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the excess emissions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a group of U.S. state attorneys general have also been investigating.
Additionally, U.S. regulators have been probing diesel emissions in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) vehicles. Daimler has said in financial filings it faced ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions that could eventually lead to significant penalties and recalls.
Unlike VW and Daimler, Fiat Chrysler still sells diesel-powered passenger vehicles in the United States and it plans to offer diesel versions in two additional Jeep SUVs by 2020.

""At the beginning of 2018 the global economy was firing on all cylinders, but it lost speed during the year and the ride could get even bumpier in the year ahead,"" World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva said in the semi-annual Global Economic Prospects report http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/01/08/darkening-prospects-global-economy-to-slow-to-29-percent-in-2019-as-trade-investment-weaken. 
The World Bank outlook comes as the United States and China have been engaged in a bitter trade dispute, which has jolted financial markets across the world for months. The two economies have imposed tit-for-tat duties on each other's goods, although there were signs of progress on Tuesday as the two countries prepared to enter a third day of talks in Beijing.
Growth in the United States is likely to slow to 2.5 percent this year from 2.9 percent in 2018, while China is expected to grow at 6.2 percent in the year compared with 6.5 percent in 2018, according to the World Bank.
Emerging market economies are expected to grow at 4.2 percent this year, with advanced economies expected to grow at 2 percent, the World Bank said in the report.

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>",Japan's younger Watanabes seek more diverse portfolios,"By Daniel Leussink and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - For years, Japan's retail currency investor were known as ""Mrs Watanabes"", a reference to the metaphorical housewife who invests family savings mostly in foreign exchange. Now, a younger generation of women is looking at a wider asset range in which to park investments.
Like their elders, Japan's ""Kinyu-joshi"" or ""finance girls"", who are largely in their 20s and 30s, face a challenging investment landscape with bank deposits offering minimal, near-zero returns.
Unlike their senior counterparts, however, younger female investors tend to be more frugal and averse to overexposure to any one single asset class. For this reason, many of them are tapping a broader asset universe using mobile-based services to keep costs low.
While younger female investors account for a much smaller chunk of Japan's investment base than their seniors do, their increasing appetite for yield represents a significant mobilization of personal capital into global financial markets.
""All my savings were in cash, but I thought that's really scary,"" said Haruka Hirokawa, 32, who works at a call center for a domestic life insurer. ""I thought it'll be necessary to diversify my investments globally from now on.""
Hirokawa, who has invested about 130,000 yen so far, has put her money into eight trusts, including international equity and multi-asset funds by investing 100 yen ($0.92) per trading day into each trust, for a total of 16,000 yen a month.
She constructed her portfolio after meeting likeminded investors at meetings of Kinyu-joshi, a women's community largely made up of people in their late 20s and early 30s that regularly meets to discuss finance matters.
Japan's senior Watanabes were best known for bets on speculative assets with volatile risk-reward ratios, specifically through foreign exchange margin trading.
That generation became big players in currency trading in the past decade as they sought to beat meager returns through tactics such as the famous carry-trade.
However, the Turkish lira's sell-off in August and its slump against the yen on Jan. 3 have forced many to abandon the high-yielding Middle Eastern unit, previously a popular choice for retail investors, and reassess their risk exposure.
By comparison, younger Watanabes are building nest eggs through regular and small investments into passive funds. Many take on international exposure by diversifying their holdings through multiple funds, rather than direct investments in underlying assets, said Minako Takekawa, a financial journalist.
Driving the shift in female investment habits in Japan is a wider anxiety about retirement in a country where the number of Japanese age 65 and older is expected to grow from 28 percent of the population to 36 percent by 2040, according to the government-backed National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.
More broadly, Japanese are flocking to new private retirement accounts to secure their own financial future, even with government encouragement.
Since opened to the general population in 2017, the new accounts, called ""iDeCo"" for individual defined contribution accounts, have grown more than threefold to more than 1 million. They are modeled on the U.S. tax-deferred Individual Retirement Accounts plans.
""The increase in new accounts is prompted by people's concerns about the future, whether they can make ends meet in their old age,"" said Aguri Sagawa, a researcher at Daiwa Institute of Research. 
More than half of the 1.859 quadrillion yen ($17.19 trillion) in Japanese household assets are still either in bank deposits or cash, compared with 13.1 percent for the United States.
Data from the Central Council for Financial Services Information, a public entity, showed that 59 percent of households inhabited by people in their 20s didn't have any savings in 2017, up from 31.8 percent a decade earlier.
However, another survey, from consultancy J.D. Power, showed 26 percent of Japanese in their 20s who didn't already invest intended to do so, compared with eight percent and four percent for those in their 50s and 60s, respectively.
For young investors like Hirokawa, there are still three decades left to build up retirement savings before they're needed.

""Assuming that we'll only receive 60 or 70 percent (in pensions) of what people are now given when we reach our retirement age, we must increase our assets by ourselves,"" said Hirokawa.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Imports at major U.S. container ports are leveling off after retailers' months-long rush to bring in Chinese merchandise before higher tariffs hit, according to a retail trade report issued on Tuesday. 
U.S. ports covered by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates' Global Port Tracker handled 1.81 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in November, the latest available data. That was up 2.5 percent year-over-year but down 11.4 percent from the record of 2.04 million TEU set in October. A TEU is one 20-foot-long cargo container.
The report landed as the United States and China hold talks aimed at ending a bitter trade war that is roiling global financial markets. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce on tariffs. 
Warehouses throughout the United States are packed to the rafters with Chinese goods - ranging from air conditioners and microwaves to footwear and furniture.
""There have been record-high levels of imports over the past several months, primarily due to raised inventories ahead of expected tariff increases,"" Hackett Associates founder Ben Hackett said. 
Apparel sellers were among the retailers who stepped up purchases as tariffs loomed. 
The value of China clothing exports to the United States jumped 7.9 percent to $494.83 billion for the January through October period, according to an analysis of customs data from logistics technology firm  Descartes Systems Group Inc  (TO:DSG). 
Top consignees for those Chinese products included JC Penney Purchasing Corp, Forever 21 Logistics LLC, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Stores Inc and Uniqlo USA LLC.
Retailers have ""brought in much of their spring merchandise early to protect consumers against higher prices that will eventually come with tariffs,"" said Jonathan Gold, NRF's vice president for supply chain and customs policy. 
The Global Port Tracker forecasts that 2018 imports will have risen 5.3 percent to a record 21.6 million TEU before cooling in the early months of the new year, when imports typically soften due to the post-holiday drop in demand and Lunar New Year factory shutdowns in Asia.
The deceleration is expected to continue into 2019 as the standoff between the world's two largest economies ripples through the global economy. FedEx Corp (N:FDX) slashed its fiscal 2019 forecasts citing a slowdowns in China and Europe, while grains trader Cargill Inc said the trade tensions hit its bottom line. 

""We are projecting ... an overall weakness in imports for the first half of the year,"" Hackett said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz sold 2.31 million passenger cars last year, likely enough to make it the top-selling premium automotive brand in 2018, although some analysts are questioning how much longer German manufacturers can dominate the luxury car industry. 
BMW (DE:BMWG), Audi (DE:NSUG) and Daimler-owned (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz have held sway in the market for high-performance limousines for decades, but analysts warn a shift toward electric and self-driving cars could open the door to new challengers, such as U.S. manufacturer Tesla (O:TSLA).
""The question is whether Tesla is the Apple (O:AAPL) of the auto industry and the established premium brands will become the Nokias and Blackberries,"" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said, referring to Apple's successful disruption of the mobile phone market, where Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Blackberry (TO:BB) once dominated.
BMW and Audi have yet to release annual sales data. Tesla said it delivered 245,240 vehicles in 2018.
The success of the German manufacturers is based on sales of combustion engined vehicles at a time when customers are hankering for newer electric cars with sophisticated software-based infotainment systems.
The Germans are also launching electric cars, but their profits come mainly from sales of high-horsepower diesel and petrol engined vehicles. 
Mercedes-Benz posted a new sales record last year thanks to an 11 percent sales jump in China, the world's largest car market, while sales in the United States and Europe fell 6.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively.
Its flagship S-class saloon saw sales rise 12 percent, while more than a third of customers chose to buy a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), and around 25 percent of sales were compact cars, Mercedes-Benz said.
""In 2018 Mercedes-Benz was at the top of the premium segment in the automotive industry for the third year in a row,""  Daimler  Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said on Tuesday.
Analysts said the Stuttgart-based company remained ahead of BMW and Volkswagen-owned (DE:VOWG_p) Audi thanks to increased production capacity in China.
""Mercedes currently has a significant lead over BMW and it is a two horse race for now. Audi will be behind for a number of years,"" Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope said.
BMW will release annual sales figures for BMW-branded passenger cars on Friday. BMW Group, which includes the Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) brands, sold 2.49 million cars last year.
By contrast, Mercedes-Benz and its sister brand Smart sold 2.44 million cars last year. 
Hummel said Tesla could pose a threat in the medium term because it offers better connectivity and over-the-air updates.

“Tesla has a lead of three to four years in areas like software and electronics. The millennials are much more focused on these things. There is a risk that the Germans can’t catch up,"" he said.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>","GM did not heed call to keep Oshawa, Ontario plant open: union boss","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The head of Canada's auto union blasted General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday for pushing ahead with plans to phase out work at its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant despite calls by workers and politicians in Canada to find a new vehicle to build there.
Unifor, the union that represents workers at the plant, has vowed to block its closure.
""They're moving ahead with their plan. We're going to continue to have discussions with them about solutions,"" Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, the union that represents workers at the plant, told Reuters after a meeting he had with GM officials at the No. 1 U.S. automaker's Detroit headquarters.
""I'm furious right now,"" Dias added. ""The reality is that GM can reverse its decision. The question is do they have the political will to do so."" 
GM said in a letter to Dias that it had already considered several proposals including those the union raised at the meeting.
""Unfortunately, all Unifor’s proposals would involve substantial incremental costs and a further deterioration of GM’s competitive position,"" GM said, adding that ""it cannot pursue them"" because of the weakening market in North America.
GM confirmed it has no plans to build vehicles in the Oshawa plant after the end of 2019, which is part of a broad restructuring announced in November. GM also has not allocated new products for four U.S. plants, raising the possibility of their closure and the elimination of a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America. 
Dias previously promised ""one hell of a fight"" to prevent the Oshawa plant's closure. Going into the Tuesday meeting, he has voiced optimism a solution could be found.
Dias also previously said one option would be to extend operations for nine months, when regular contract talks are scheduled to begin, allowing more time for a long-term solution. 
The union has said the decision is contrary to commitments made by GM in contract negotiations with Unifor in 2016. Unifor said the deal stipulates there will be no plant closures before Sept. 21, 2020.
After he returned from the meeting with GM, Dias told reporters in a press conference in Windsor, Ontario, that the union was looking at its legal options regarding whether the Detroit company violated the labor contract.
GM officials have said the fate of the U.S. plants is subject to talks with the United Auto Workers union, which represents the U.S. workers at those plants. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra promised in early December to keep an ""open mind"" about another affected plant, Ohio's Lordstown Assembly.
Hundreds of workers walked off the job at the Oshawa plant in protest on the day GM announced its plans.

GM has said the Oshawa closure affects 2,973 assembly line jobs. The company employs 8,150 in Canada.

1553,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Trump to Address Immigration Tonight
With the partial government shutdown putting many economic indicators on hold, geopolitics is holding a bigger sway on the markets.
President Donald Trump will address the cause of that shutdown -- a border wall showdown between him and the Democrats that control the House of Representatives -- tonight from the Oval Office at 9:00 PM ET (02:00 GMT Wednesday).
Trump has floated the idea of declaring a national emergency to get funding and use the military to build a wall along the entirety of the U.S. southern border.
Democratic leaders have said they won’t budge on a project that is ineffective and expensive.
A move by Trump to declare a national emergency could bring about legal battles over presidential powers and eminent domain, but could also take away a key stumbling block to passing a budget and reopening the federal government.
2. China-U.S. Trade Talks Enter Third Day
Along with the government shutdown, investors will be watching trade talks for any signs of progress.
The talks were extended for another day and resume tomorrow.
Steven Winberg, Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy told reporters at the U.S. delegation's hotel that talks, which began on Monday, had gone well.
""I confirm we're continuing tomorrow, yes,"" Winberg told reporters, declining to answer further questions.
The editor-in-chief of China's state-run Global Times tabloid Hu Xijin said on Twitter earlier that negotiations would continue on Wednesday.



""China-U.S. trade talks haven't concluded after two days of tough work. I heard they will continue tomorrow. This sends a signal: The two sides are in serious talks and working hard to solve the disagreements between them,"" Hu said.
3. Homebuilders to Report Earnings
Earnings season is drawing nearer and homebuilders weigh in with numbers tomorrow.
Before the bell,  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) will report, with analysts predicting a profit of $1.96 per share on sales of more than $6.5 billion.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) issues results after the bell. On average, analysts predict a profit of 94 cents per share on sales of more than $1.3 billion.
Both stocks are down over the last three months.
Also after the bell, home products retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) will report, with the Street looking for a profit of 17 cents per share on sales of about $3 billion.
Shares of the company have been cut almost in half over the last 12 months.

1554,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>",Philippine Stock Bulls on a Roll as Overseas Funding Returns,"(Bloomberg) -- Philippine bulls are on a roll, and who can blame them? The nation’s equities index has started the year beating many global peers, and foreign fund managers are putting back money in a market that was among Asia’s worst in 2018.
Traders at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. and AB Capital & Investment Corp. are riding the rally by deploying their cash, rather than cutting their stock holdings as they did last year whenever equities went into high gear. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index’s 3.2 percent rise in the first five trading days of January has enough momentum to break through 8,000 this quarter, they said. That’s another 3.9 percent gain from Tuesday’s close.
“It’s a good strategy to ride the prevailing positive mood, even if only for the short term,” said Gerard Abad, who manages $380 million as chief investment officer at AB Capital. “We will see a continuation of the improvement in inflation, and it helps that the U.S. Fed has become dovish. That eases pressure on the central bank to raise rates.”
The optimism stems from encouraging inflation data -- it slowed for a second month from a nine-year high, reaching its slowest pace since May -- and prospects that the Federal Reserve will ease interest-rate increases. That’s brought down the U.S. dollar from a high, prompting foreign investors to come back to the Philippines: They’ve already pumped in $49 million in equity funds this year, including the longest streak of daily inflows in five months, after $1.08 billion of withdrawals in 2018.
“Sentiments are very bullish,” said Rizal Bank trader Steven Ko, who helps manage about $1.72 billion. “We are taking profit in some of the leaders, but rotate the money into stocks that will outperform as the climb to the 8,100 to 8,200 level is quite possible from here.”
Ko is looking for market laggards, with a preference for banks and consumer-related shares on expectations margins will improve and earnings will grow. Abad, who in addition to those sectors also likes property, is withdrawing from mid-cap stocks and putting the money into the market’s biggest companies, which he expects will propel the nation’s benchmark index higher.
Yet he recommends to “cut exposure” should the Philippine equity index break the 8,200 to 8,300 level, which he sees as likely. With the prevailing bullish sentiment, and should fourth-quarter gross domestic product data show a pick up in growth, the gauge could even hit 8,400, he said.
“It won’t hurt to be conservative and top slice if the market rallies too fast, too soon,” Abad said. “It’s better to wait for first-quarter earnings for confirmation of whether this rally is standing on fundamental legs.”
Optimism for earnings growth is renewing interest from overseas investors and helping support valuations, Ko said. That’s even though, at 16 times projected profit for the next year, they remain among the highest in Asia.
“It’s too early to say if the foreign-fund inflow is a reversal of last year’s withdrawals, but definitely there is some interest in emerging markets and the Philippines,” Ko said.

With no end in sight for the partial U.S. government shutdown, analysts have begun scouring the depths of federal bureaucracy to identify the firms most jeopardized by a long-term deadlock. Washington’s budget impasse will become the longest in American history on Jan. 12, days after the president delivers a prime-time speech Tuesday and visits the border later this week.
Stocks like Macy’s Inc.,  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG)., Monro Inc., and Hyatt Hotels Corp. are some of the consumer-facing firms most exposed to the Washington, D.C., metro area, where federal workers will miss their first paychecks on Jan. 11, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note today.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>",Prospect of U.S. profit drop rises for investors,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are growing more fearful that U.S. companies' profits could shrink this year following Apple's warning of soft demand in China, coupled with mounting evidence of a drag from tariffs, a global slowdown and fading tailwinds from tax cuts.
Profit-growth estimates for 2019 had already been eroding for months before widely held Apple Inc (O:AAPL) darkened the outlook further last week with the first cut to its sales forecast in more than 15 years.
Earnings this year were never going to rise as quickly as in 2018, when federal tax cuts fueled growth rates above 20 percent for S&P 500 (SPX) companies for much of the year, according to Refinitiv's IBES. For 2019, analysts now see profits growing by 6.8 percent, down sharply from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent earnings growth.
Moreover, in the first half of 2019, profits are seen rising substantially more slowly than that pace, thanks largely to the rapid decline in forecasts for technology sector earnings, which should account for roughly a fifth of the index's profits.
That has some investors watching for signs that U.S. stocks could slip into a profits recession, defined as at least two straight quarters of year-over-year earnings declines. The last of those occurred from July 2015 through June of 2016, which dovetailed with a broad run of stock market underperformance.
""You bet it's on the radar,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. ""The Apple comments and where they're headed - that's going to cause estimates to come down even further.""
APPLE WARNING 'GOES TO THE HEART'
Increased concern over the potential for an earnings recession comes at a turbulent time for stocks, with the S&P 500 registering its worst December performance since the Great Depression, only to rally more than 9 percent since hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve.
With the S&P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings, down from a multiple of 18 a year ago, a key argument for market bulls is that stocks have become undervalued after the recent sell-off.
Apple's news also highlights the potential impact of trade tensions between the two largest economies, the United States and China.
The warning from Apple ""started to provide kind of a confirmation for the earnings recession folks out there,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
""Its impact goes beyond just its suppliers; it goes to the heart of investment psyche for a lot of folks,"" he said. 
Profit forecasts for technology companies have fallen more than for any sector other than energy, which has been buffeted by the collapse in oil prices. 
S&P 500 tech (SPLRCT) earnings are expected to decline year-over-year for the first three quarters of 2019, based on Refinitiv's data, and deliver growth of just 2.6 percent this year, the lowest of any sector. 
That is a big reversal from its long-standing role as a profit-growth leader. Tech, in the top three sectors ranked by profit growth in seven of the last eight quarters, is estimated to have delivered earnings per share growth of 23.2 percent in 2018.
To be sure, there are plenty of strategists who still say an earnings recession this year is unlikely, thanks to a relatively still solid U.S. economy. Friday's jobs report helped support that view.
""Earnings recessions are exceptionally rare outside of an economic recession,"" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company in Boston. ""I don't think we are going to have another earnings recession, but it might feel like a recession.""
PROFIT RECESSION VS ECONOMIC RECESSION
Since 1968, as far back as Refinitiv's data goes, the S&P 500 has had 10 earnings recessions, the longest spanning from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2009. That roughly coincided with a financial crisis and the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.
While the last S&P 500 earnings recession occurred without an economic recession, that was an exception. Seven of the 10 profit recessions since 1968 have coincided with a formal economic recession.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. quarterly profit growth since 1968 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2H11rNA) 
Financials, health care and other sectors could pick up some of the slack as tech earnings falter, some strategists say. This year's estimates for those sectors have held up better than others, Refinitiv's numbers show. 
Adding to U.S. companies' potential woes, a strengthening dollar could become an even bigger negative for many U.S. multinationals this year, strategists said. 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 1 percent during the fourth quarter and was up 4.4 percent year-over-year by the end of the quarter.
""People are just starting to talk about (dollar strength),"" Fiduciary Trust's Olsen said. Weaker oil prices will drag as well, he said, in a reversal of what occurred in 2018.
Top strategists at some big banks had been getting more pessimistic on earnings heading into the new year.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in its outlook late last year said there was more than a 50 percent chance of a ""modest earnings recession"" in 2019.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists nodded to the weakening trend in a recent note: ""We expect a sharp slowdown in profit growth in all regions this year, particularly in the U.S., coupled with significant downgrades to consensus expectations.""

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>","Mexico to cut taxes on IPOs, stocks near two-month high","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's leftist government said on Tuesday it would lower taxes on owners of businesses that issue shares, lifting the local stock market, which was battered last year by worries about policymaking under the new administration.
Finance Minister Carlos Urzua said at a government-sponsored event in Mexico City that the tax rate on returns from initial public offerings would drop to 10 percent from 30 percent.
""The idea is to try to promote initial public offerings"" Urzua said.
He noted that Mexico had a low number of publicly listed companies compared with other major economies in Latin America.
Mexico's benchmark S&P/BMV IPC stock index (MXX) extended gains after the announcement to rise 1.5 percent to a nearly two-month high.
""The market liked it,"" said Gerardo Sienra, head of equity sales at Mexican brokerage Intercam. 
Last year, Mexican stocks were hammered after Lopez Obrador canceled a partly built $13 billion airport and lawmakers from his leftist majority introduced unexpected bills, such as a plan to limit bank fees.
""In these first days of the year, the feeling is more confident,"" Sienra said. But he added that ""there is a lot of caution, because we have seen that on any given day, the rules could change.""
The IPO tax cut was among several new measures directed at the financial sector, including a platform for mobile-phone banking that Urzua said would help draw more un-banked Mexicans into the financial sector.
Only 60 percent of adult Mexicans have a bank account and most transactions are done in cash, he said. 
Urzua also said pension funds would get more flexibility on investment decisions, but he did not provide specific details.
The finance minister spoke at the event along with other top officials, including Central Bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon.
Last week, the central bank filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court, challenging a new law mandating salary cuts for its and other government officials on the grounds that the statute interfered with the bank's constitutionally guaranteed independence.

Lopez Obrador has said he would respect the central bank's autonomy, and Urzua said the Bank of Mexico was ""a very good bank in terms of monetary policy"" at Tuesday's event.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Nissan's Ghosn claims innocence in first appearance since November arrest,"By Tim Kelly and Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn declared his innocence in his first public appearance since his November arrest, telling a Tokyo court on Tuesday that he had been wrongly accused of financial misconduct.
Ghosn, credited with rescuing Nissan Motor Co from near-bankruptcy two decades ago, was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs and a rope around his waist. He was wearing a navy suit and white shirt without a tie, and looked thinner than before his arrest, with his dark hair showing gray roots.
""I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" the 64-year-old executive told the Tokyo District Court in a clear voice, reading from a prepared statement.
""I believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company, I have acted honorably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company,"" he said.
From early morning, a crowd of journalists and television crews thronged outside the courthouse, and some 1,122 people lined up for 14 court seats assigned by lottery, highlighting strong interest in the case. News of the hearing was given top billing on public broadcaster NHK throughout the day.
The court hearing, requested by Ghosn's lawyers, was held to explain the reasons for his prolonged detention since his Nov. 19 arrest rather than to argue merits of the case. Judge Yuichi Tada said the detention was due to flight risk and the possibility he could conceal evidence.
But Ghosn used the opportunity to deny accusations against him, kicking off what is expected to be a lengthy counter-attack against the accusations.
Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said the court appearance was a public relations victory for Ghosn because it gave him an opportunity to counter the weeks of negative news about him.
""In this high-profile case, news had been dominated by information from the prosecutors and Nissan, so the public tended to view him accordingly,"" he said. ""But today it was all Ghosn. That's very significant.""
After weeks of silence, Ghosn's lawyers insisted in an afternoon press conference that the courts have no reason to keep him behind bars during the investigation.
On Dec. 31, the Tokyo District Court granted prosecutors' request to extend Ghosn's detention by 10 days until Jan. 11. 
But former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who heads Ghosn's defense team, said it was likely Ghosn would stay in custody until the trial starts, which could be in six months, given the practice in Japan of keeping defendants locked up until trial.
The Tokyo District Court said later on Tuesday that Ghosn's lawyers have asked for an end to his detention. 
One of Ghosn's lawyers, Masato Oshikubo, told Reuters that a reply from the court to the request could come on Wednesday. 
INVESTMENT LOSSES AND SAUDI PAYMENTS
Ghosn has been formally charged with under-reporting his income. He has also been arrested, but not yet indicted, on allegations of aggravated breach of trust in shifting personal investment losses to the carmaker.
""I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed,"" Ghosn told the court.
Regarding allegations that he transferred losses to Nissan, Ghosn said he had asked the company to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contracts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. 
He said he did this to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral.
""My moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time,"" said Ghosn. ""A captain doesn't jump ship in the middle of a storm."" 
Otsuru said that Nissan had agreed to the arrangement, on condition that any losses or gains would be Ghosn's. 
Ghosn said the contracts were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss.
Ghosn is also accused of paying $14.7 million to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali using Nissan funds in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses.
Ghosn said that Juffali's company was compensated for ""critical services that substantially benefited Nissan"", including soliciting financing and resolving a business dispute.
The Khaled Juffali Company has issued a statement saying it had received the payments for legitimate business purposes. 
Nissan, which has ousted Ghosn as chairman, reiterated that its internal investigation prompted by an informant had uncovered ""substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct"" and that its investigation was ongoing and expanding in scope.
ALLIANCE RATTLED
The case has rattled Nissan's alliance with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), where Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive. He had been pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger at the French government's urging, despite strong reservations at Nissan.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday Ghosn is presumed innocent until proven guilty and that there is therefore no reason to remove him from the top job at Renault. The French government is Renault's main shareholder.
""If the situation were to last an unreasonable period - and I don't have a period in mind, but if the situation were to last indefinitely - of course, we would have to make a decision, but we are not at this point,"" Le Maire said on a French TV station.
French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud reiterated the government's call for Nissan and Renault to preserve the alliance, seen as crucial for the two to compete long-term amid trends such as autonomous driving. 
""The most important thing today is that the presumption of innocence is respected and that we look after the Renault-Nissan alliance. There are many jobs at stake,"" she told a television news channel.
Ghosn's arrest has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.
Ghosn has been held at the Tokyo Detention Center, a spartan facility where small rooms have a toilet in the corner and no heater. His son, Anthony Ghosn, said his father had lost 10 kgs (22 pounds) during his detention, according to France's weekly Journal du Dimanche.
Otsuru said Ghosn had been moved to a larger room with a western-style bed, but did not say when that had happened.
Nissan's Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also arrested on Nov. 19 and has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn's income, was released on Dec. 25 after posting bail of 70 million yen, or about $640,000, in cash.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>","On brink of demise, Sears to reconsider billionaire chairman's bid","By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp agreed on Tuesday to consider a revised takeover bid from billionaire Chairman Edward Lampert, temporarily staving off a liquidation that would have spelled the end of the 126-year-old U.S. department-store chain. 
Lampert's latest attempt to rescue Sears came after his previous $4.4 billion bid fell short, prompting the retailer to make liquidation preparations ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing in New York on Tuesday.
An attorney for Sears told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain that Lampert is expected to submit a revised offer for the retailer, along with a $120 million deposit, by 4 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) on Wednesday. The attorney, Ray Schrock of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, did not disclose further details of the new offer, which materialized after what he described as several days of round-the-clock negotiations.
Drain said that Sears will weigh Lampert's offer against a proposed liquidation during a Jan. 14 bankruptcy auction. Should Lampert's offer falter again, he will forfeit more than $17 million from his deposit to Sears creditors. 
Lampert's bid, which recently envisioned keeping open 425 stores and preserving up to 50,000 jobs, still faces hurdles that could cause it to unravel in the coming days and prompt Sears to shut down for good. 
""This is a large company...that affects a lot of people,"" Drain said during Tuesday's hearing. He called the expectation of a revised bid from Lampert a ""good development"" that could allow Sears to ""survive as a going concern, at least in part.""
The latest twist in Sears' monthslong bankruptcy proceedings offers new hope that the teetering retailer could remain operational, albeit in smaller form, sparing the jobs of many of its 68,000 workers. Were Sears to liquidate its assets, it would become one of the most high-profile victims in the wave of bankruptcies that has swept the retail sector in the last few years, as the explosion in online shopping exacerbates the fierce price competition facing brick-and-mortar stores.
In a stark contrast between e-commerce firms and many physical retailers, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the world's most valuable company for the first time this week, reaching a market capitalization of close to $800 billion.
Sears' agreement to reconsider Lampert's offer tables for now controversies that pushed the retailer to the brink. 
As part of his bid, Lampert requested a legal release that would clear him from exposure to litigation over transactions he engaged in with Sears before it filed for bankruptcy protection. 
As of Monday night, unsecured creditors were unwilling to give him the release, as they remained intent on investigating some of the past deals, said a person familiar with the discussions. The deals, which Lampert maintains were proper, helped make him the company's largest creditor, in addition to its biggest shareholder.
Lampert's offer also included a proposal to forgive $1.3 billion of debt he holds in exchange for ownership of the reconstituted Sears, a bankruptcy maneuver known as a credit bid that has also drawn objections from creditors. The controversy will remain unresolved heading into the Jan. 14 auction, and faces scrutiny from Drain should Lampert prevail with his bid.
Unsecured creditors, which include Sears landlords and bondholders, have pushed for the retailer to liquidate, partially because they contend they will realize a better financial recovery if it does. 
Abid Qureshi, an attorney representing those creditors, said there are concerns about Lampert's takeover bid, including ""significant, viable claims"" against Lampert regarding pre-bankruptcy transactions. 
PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS
Another point of contention in previous negotiations between Lampert and Sears centered on whether Lampert's bid fully addressed the bankruptcy costs that Sears has racked up, according to people familiar with the matter.
The costs, which include bills from lawyers and financial advisers, are expected to exceed $200 million, those sources said. 
Sears' bankruptcy, which includes discount chain Kmart, followed a decade of revenue declines, hundreds of store closures, and years of deals by Lampert to turn around the company he put together in 2005 through an $11 billion deal.
Sears, known for its mail-order catalogs, dates back to 1893. Merchandise from toys, medicine, gramophones, automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon of its time.
The iconic retailer gradually lost its shine, however, as consumers turned to e-commerce and brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Lampert had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world as well as a radio station and Allstate (NYSE:ALL) insurance.
But critics say Lampert let the stores deteriorate, even as he bought the company's stock and lent it money.

The largest U.S. toy retailer, Toys ‘R’ Us, tried to emerge from its 2017 bankruptcy filing but was also forced to liquidate six months later, after creditors lost confidence in its turnaround plan.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 03:37PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Top suspect in Vitol, Glencore Brazil bribery case arrested in U.S. - court","By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian man facing allegations of bribing officials at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) on behalf of Vitol Group [VITOLV.UL],  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and other major oil trading firms has been arrested in the United States, authorities said Tuesday. 
Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade was detained in the U.S. on Dec. 20, an arrest that was disclosed in a Brazilian court document seen by Reuters. He was arrested with the help of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)). Besides handling deportation cases, ICE carries out investigations of transnational crime. 
An e-mail included in the court document from a Brazilian federal police official based in Miami indicated that Andrade is being held in an undisclosed location in the United States and that Brazil has requested his extradition. It was not clear when he may be sent back to Brazil. 
ICE did not respond to requests for comment. An investigator with Brazil's federal police confirmed the arrest on condition that they not be named as they were not authorized to speak with the press, but declined to provide more details. 
Andrade was charged in Brazil for acting as a middleman between top executives at Vitol, allegedly funneling bribes to Petrobras officials in exchange for sweetheart deals from the state-run firm. Officials allege that he also carried out the same services for Glencore and other big oil trading firms to win sweetheart contracts with Petrobras.
Two former executives of Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] were charged in the same scheme on Dec. 14.
The cases are the latest part of Brazil's ""Car Wash"" investigation, launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras. The probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru.
Brazilian prosecutors have said they will pressure the middlemen charged and arrested to turn state's witness and testify against powerful executives at the massive oil trading firms, the same method they have used for years to take down top targets.
Prosecutors alleged in their charges against Andrade that both Vitol's head of U.S. operations Mike Loya and its Latin American and the Caribbean boss Antonio Maarraoui, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui has been charged. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment. 
Prosecutors said at least $2.85 million in bribes were involved in the cases involving the oil traders, and have called their discoveries so far the ""tip of the iceberg."" 
A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators. 
Glencore has said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. 
The stakes are high for both trading firms.
Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case could widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases. 
The probe has already frozen current business for the trading firms in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms.
Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall revenue of $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market. 

Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras' prized Nigerian oilfields. Petrobras has said there are no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co delivered a record 806 aircraft in 2018 as it overcame supplier woes, retaining the title of the world's biggest planemaker for the seventh straight year.
The company's shares rose as much as 3.9 percent to $340.90 and were the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
European rival Airbus SE, which will report its numbers on Wednesday and lags behind Boeing due to engine delays, said it achieved its 800-jet target pending final audit.

Investors and analysts closely watch the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms for hints on the company's cashflow and revenue.
The latest numbers indicate that fuselage and engine delays at suppliers in 2018 are largely behind Boeing as it gears up to meet surging demand for airplanes in 2019 amid booming air travel.
""In addition to the ongoing demand for the 737 MAX, we saw strong sales for every one of our twin-aisle airplanes,"" said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing. 
To mitigate supply chain snarls, Boeing helped expand production capacity at suppliers who have hired workers, including retirees this year.
In October, its biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc said it was back on track to meet the surging demand for its aircraft parts.
CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, also affirmed in the same month its commitment to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 units despite being roughly four weeks behind schedule.
ORDER BOOM
Boeing also looked set to beat Airbus for aircraft orders on a like-for-like basis in 2018 after booking 893 net orders, excluding cancellations in the year.
Meanwhile, Airbus ended November with 380 net orders, to which it has since added confirmed deals for another 220 aircraft. 
According to industry sources, it won another 150 from Asian-backed leasing companies that are yet to be announced, with Boeing also getting a lift from Chinese demand.
The Airbus tally, however, included 120 of the former Bombardier CSeries, a Canadian plane program which it bought last year.
Orders for Boeing and Airbus are seen down compared to 2017 as airlines fret over trade tensions and the slowing global economic growth. But deliveries at both rose on the back of an earlier order boom.

""69 December 737 deliveries suggest (supplier) bottlenecks easing. Solid December book-to-bill closes year at 1.1x and helps mitigate cycle concerns,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn said in a client note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of world stocks rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, with investors hopeful that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their months-long trade war that has hurt sentiment in financial markets.
Increased risk appetite helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, while the dollar, which hit an 11-week low on Monday, rebounded as the euro weakened on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy.
Tuesday's advance for stocks added to gains logged over the past two sessions following last week's strong U.S. employment report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth.
Trade and concerns over slowing economic growth triggered a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimates and stock valuations.
On Tuesday, MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.62 percent to a more than three-week high.
The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said on Tuesday.
Trade talks this week in Beijing are the first face-to-face discussions since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in their trade war.
Trump, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, reiterated his recent statement that the talks with China were going well but gave no details.
""You're seeing some negotiations happen and the market is starting to think that perhaps we'll start to see a framework evolve,"" said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments.
The recent stocks rally has lifted the S&P 500 (SPX) by about 9 percent from 20-month lows hit around Christmas.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 241.31 points, or 1.03 percent, to 23,772.66, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 20.55 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,570.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 63.63 points, or 0.93 percent, to 6,887.10.
European shares hit a three-week high in a broad-based rebound on hopes of a possible trade deal between China and the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) closed up 0.87 percent. 
U.S. Treasury yields climbed, in line with higher U.S. stocks, on improved risk appetite and as the Treasury Department sold $38 billion in three-year notes to relatively soft demand.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.7101 percent, up from 2.682 percent on Monday.
The dollar rose against the euro as investors focused on the risk of a euro zone recession after data showed more signs of slowing in the region. The euro was 0.3 lower against the greenback.
""The euro had its upturn halted by German data showing the third decline in as many months in a gauge of factory growth,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The improved appetite for risk and the stronger dollar weighed on gold prices. Spot gold  slipped 0.3 percent to $1,284.71 per ounce. 
Oil prices extended gains, supported by hopes that the U.S.-China trade talks might defuse the trade dispute, while OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets.

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose $1.39 to settle at $58.72 a barrel, a 2.4 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) futures rose $1.26 to settle at $49.78 a barrel, a 2.6 percent gain.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Saba Capital's Tail Hedge Master Fund gains 25 percent in 2018,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Saba Capital's Tail Hedge Master Fund, which promises a sort of doomsday insurance through bets that perform well when markets spiral, ended 2018 with a 25 percent gain, a person familiar with the fund's returns said on Tuesday.
For years, Boaz Weinstein, who founded the New York-based hedge fund a decade ago, was sure volatility would return to markets even as data showed trading conditions in early 2018 were among the most stable in over four decades.
By the year-end, markets nearly tumbled into bear market territory - defined as a 20 percent drop from the high - and Weinstein's fund, designed to protect investors from unexpected events, surged.
The firm's flagship Saba Capital Master Fund also performed well, climbing 11.1 percent.
A Saba spokesman declined to comment.
In December, when the average hedge fund lost money as markets plummeted, the Tail Hedge Master Fund gained nearly 20 percent, the person said.
Saba's tail fund is one of a handful of portfolios that plays off of the definition of tail risk, which describes times when bigger shocks than normal occur. Capula Investment Management and Ionic Capital Management run similar funds.
Tail funds were not in high demand when the market kept moving higher. But even in early 2018, some institutional investors bet the market would eventually crack, and added money to Saba's fund.
At the end of 2018, Saba's total assets under management were $1.6 billion, up 25 percent from a year earlier. Saba's portfolios that invest in closed-end funds, including its Saba Capital CEF Opportunities 1 Onshore portfolio, took in $250 million in new money late in 2018.
Here Weinstein often flexes his activist muscle by pushing management to take action and shrink the discounts at which the funds trade to their net asset value.
On Wall Street, Weinstein is best known for skewering JP Morgan's so-called London Whale, when one of its traders in 2012 accumulated an outsized position in credit default swaps that cost the bank some $6 billion. CDS are often seen as insurance on loans, designed to protect in the case of defaults.
In 2018, Weinstein again won in the world of defaults by successfully picking the year's two biggest -- oilfield services provider Parker Drilling and retailer Sears Holdings Corp. In 2017, at the Robin Hood investment conference, Weinstein sounded the alarm bells on Parker Drilling, which filed for pre-arranged Chapter 11 in December.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",U.S. top court's Kavanaugh issues first opinion in arbitration case,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's newest member, Brett Kavanaugh, issued his first written opinion on Tuesday as the justices in a unanimous ruling bolstered companies' ability to use arbitration to resolve disputes with customers or other businesses.
The court decided 9-0 to throw out a lower-court ruling that had kept a case involving dental equipment companies from being resolved through arbitration because the court had determined the demand for arbitration was groundless.
Newly appointed justices are generally assigned non-controversial, unanimous cases as their first opinions.
Kavanaugh joined the court in October after a raucous confirmation process during which he had to fend off accusations of sexual assault by California university professor Christine Blasey Ford. He was the second conservative justice named to the court by Republican President Donald Trump, after Justice Neil Gorsuch. 
Kavanaugh's appointment solidified a 5-4 conservative majority on the court. He replaced retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals on social issues like abortion.
The arbitration case involved price-fixing claims lodged by Plano, Texas-based dental equipment distributor Archer and White Sales Inc against other manufacturers and distributors. 
It centered on whether courts can prevent arbitrators from deciding if an issue can be arbitrated at all. Companies prefer to arbitrate claims because it is cheaper and faster than litigation in court, which is harder to fight and carries a greater risk of hefty damages awards by juries. 
When a contract allows arbitrators to decide whether a dispute can be resolved through arbitration, ""a court may not override the contract,"" Kavanaugh said on Tuesday, explaining the decision.

Although Tuesday's ruling was Kavanaugh's first opinion for the court, his first known vote as a member of the court was in December when he joined other justices to reject appeals by Louisiana and Kansas seeking to end their public funding to women’s healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood through the Medicaid program.

1573,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","COT Data Positive on Crude, Negative on Live Cattle","Andy Waldock of Commodity & Derivative Advisors, shows current trends in Commercial Interest from the CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) report.
The petroleum markets have fallen more than 40% since early October. The higher crude climbed over the last year, the more it expanded drillers’ margins. The Baker Hughes U.S. Rig Count has risen by 153 active rigs over the last year, and now stands at 1,083. The surge is a direct result of being able to hedge future production at a profitable margin. Drillers needed this rally to get back to work, and increased production efficiencies learned from the last bust brought new production online in record fashion, this February. Commercial traders (drillers) set a net short record of more than 760,000 contracts. 
The tide has turned, and the market’s decline is projecting a shift in profit margins back in favor of the refiners. The refiners were remarkably patient during the market’s rally, but their purchases have accelerated, bringing the net commercial position to its most bullish position since the July 2017 low of $42.27 per barrel in the September 2017 contract.
This market is set up for a reversal higher because the refiners are buying in massive quantities and the drillers have sold forward enough production at higher prices to sit on their hands and wait for prices to rise. This leaves makes the large speculative short position exposed to a potentially thin market moving higher and fueled by stop-loss purchases and profit-taking as the market seeks a new equilibrium.
Live Cattle
Live cattle has been marching higher since early April. There are a couple of factors that suggest the farmers may be selling more aggressively than the packers are buying through the end of the month. First, as noted on the worksheet (see table below), commercial momentum is negative over the last four weeks as well as overall. Live cattle prices have continued to climb, attracting more short hedging. More importantly, the short hedging pace has accelerated as we’ve neared overhead resistance.
The added producer selling is also part of a more significant pattern playing out on an annual basis. We eat less beef in January than we do in December. This social trend has also accelerated. Recent historical trends show April live cattle rallying from Jan. 1 through mid-February before an about-face decline of roughly 14% by the April contract’s first notice date. We see the commercial traders preparing for the same setup this year. Deeper digging shows an expected decline similar to last year’s may be a bit greedy. A rational approach sees the commercial traders defend the $128-130 resistance and force the market lower by Feb. 1.

1574,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",Will Stocks & the Dollar Resume Slide,"Stocks and the U.S. Dollar remain under pressure with questions over trade deals and the economy as 2019 trading begins in earnest, according to Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst, Forex.com
Investors, speculators and other market participants who were away during the holidays are slowly returning to the markets. Those that made it back in the first week of 2019 had to hit the ground running. Stocks initially tumbled on the back of a revenue warning from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and as fears about the health of the Chinese economy grew, before Wall Street staged one of the best one-day gains in seven years on Friday.
Friday’s gains came on the back of strong jobs and wages data from the U.S. economy, which alleviated growth concerns about the wold’s largest economy. What’s more, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered some reassurance on interest rates as he said the Fed will not rush to tighten further and that reductions in the central bank’s balance sheet was not necessarily on “autopilot,” walking back his previous hawkish comments.
Stocks were supported further after China announced fresh measures to boost lending in order to halt a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. Meanwhile there were signs of progress on the U.S-China trade dispute after Beijing confirmed that it would hold trade talks with the United States next week.
In the FX space, the U.S. dollar fell on Friday despite a 312,000 gain in December non-farm payrolls and a better-than-expected 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings, as Powell’s dovish remarks gave the dollar bears the perfect excuse to exert pressure on the buck after its post-NFP bounce.
Stocks not out of the woods, pressure growing on the dollar
As we start the first full trading week of 2019 now, the U.S. dollar is finding itself under pressure and stock indices are giving back some of the sharp gains made on Friday. It is not clear at this stage whether it is “risk-off” environment again, as some profit-taking should have been expected after Friday’s big rally in what essentially is a bearish trend for stocks. Things should become clearer in a few days’ time as the major U.S. indices test key technical levels, with the S&P 500, for example, deciding whether to hold below or break back above the February 2018 low around 2532 (see chart).
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com
In addition, the fourth quarter U.S. earnings season is set to unofficially start next week. If we see more misses than beats, the selling pressure could resume. Meanwhile as far as the dollar is concerned, sentiment is slowly turning bearish on the buck as investors continue to push their Fed rate hike expectations further out, and prepare for potential tightening from the likes of the European Central Bank and Bank of England. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data shows speculators are still heavily net long the dollar, which may not be a great sign for the buck going forward. Profit-taking from this group of market participants could unravel the dollar-rally. In fact, the Dollar Index may have already started its bearish trend, as it has broken outside of its bullish channel (see chart).

US-China Trade talks, Brexit key focal points
Going forward, investors will be watching trade developments between the world’s largest economies closely again after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed last month to a trade truce on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Argentina. Meanwhile, be prepared to be bombarded with Brexit-related headlines as UK Parliament returns from the Christmas holiday with the rescheduled “meaningful vote” on Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement deal due to take place, most likely, on Tuesday Jan. 15. Although a lot could go wrong, the GBP/USD is inching higher for now as the dollar sells off.
US CPI and BOC among fundamental highlights this week
In terms of this week, don’t expect too much reaction from the minutes of the FOMC’s December policy meeting, which will be released on Wednesday. At that meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates for the fourth time in 2018 despite pressure from President Trump, and signalled just two rate increases in 2019. However, the minutes will be dated as we have already heard from the Fed Chair on Friday, when he walked back his remarks on the Fed’s balance sheet reduction being on autopilot. Powell is expected to speak again on Thursday at The Economic Club of Washington DC.
As far as this week’s scheduled economic data is concerned, we will have the ISM services PMI later today but the key U.S. data will probably be Friday’s publication of consumer price inflation (CPI). Investors will be watching for signs that inflation is slowing down as they try to determine the Fed’s next move on monetary policy.
On Friday we will also have UK GDP and manufacturing production data, although the markets are unlikely to react too much on this as the focus will be firmly fixated on Brexit. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada’s rate decision is on Wednesday. Previously, the BOC was expected to hike rates to 2.0% at this meeting, but now the market expects the central bank to keep rates unchanged at 1.75% after a strong hint from the bank’s Governor at the end of last year."

But now we could see a reversal of that massive selloff as OPEC and Saudi Arabia over adjust, reports Phil Flynn of The PRICE Futures Group.
Oil is continuing its comeback, up six sessions in a row, as it is more apparent that some of the reasons that oil sold off were not valid in the first place. The talk of a U.S. recession obviously was way overstepping reality, especially after that blockbuster U.S. jobs report on Friday. Now with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Saudi Arabia plans to over comply with production cuts by reducing exports by 800,000 barrels-per-day, and there should be a signal to the market that supplies will soon tighten. The Saudis are signaling that they want $80 crude oil, and they probably will get it.
The economic backdrop is looking better as the Federal Reserve signaled that they would be flexible with their path of interest rate hikes and balance sheet wind down. Yet, the recent break in crude oil that caught almost everyone by surprise has already caused a pullback in investment and drilling in the shale patch. Over estimations of shale production and underestimation of OPEC’s resolve to cut output caused this exaggerated move, but the market is self-correcting. The Christmas Eve price massacre is now looking more like a capitulation bottom, and now it looks like we will get back into an undersupplied market in just a matter of months.
The big price collapse after President Trump granted waivers on Iranian oil, led to a run on the oil bank. But now we could see a reversal of that massive selloff as OPEC and Saudi Arabia over adjust.
The Financial Times is reporting U.K. North Sea exploration fell to a 50-year low, extending a decline as investment could raise questions about the long -term viability of the area. 10 billion to maybe 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent are reportedly left in the North Sea, and it is obvious that we will need much higher sustained prices to get it.
Reuters is reporting that an oil tanker exploded off Hong Kong's southern coast Tuesday, killing one crew member and leaving three others missing at sea. Authorities said the Vietnam-registered vessel burst into flames as it prepared to refuel. Twenty-one crew members were rescued from the waters.
Gasoline Shortages in Mexico! The AP is reporting that “Mexicans are scrambling for gasoline amid long lines at gas stations and widespread shortages prompted by a change in distribution methods aimed at stemming fuel theft. The AP reported that Mexico’s state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos said the use of more secure transportation methods has resulted in delays for fuel delivery to gas stations in the states of Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoacan, Mexico and Queretaro. It is urging consumers not to panic or hoard gasoline, promising that supply will soon stabilize.
Frantic consumers have made a run on the pumps and social media has been filled with images of gas station signs saying they are out of fuel, and consumers comparing the thin supplies to scarcity for basic goods like bread and milk that plagued Mexico during the 1970s. The shortage has given ammunition to government critics, who say many of the new administration’s policies and goals are throwbacks to past decades.”
These myriad pieces of bullish news could add steam to the recent reversal in crude oil."
1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",French motorway operator Sanef tries to cushion toll hike,"By Dominique Vidalon and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - French motorway operator Sanef said on Tuesday it was working on proposals to cushion the impact on drivers of a planned hike in toll charges, following a government request as nationwide protests over high living costs continue. 
From Feb. 1, French highway toll prices are expected to rise by 1.8 percent on average, after increasing by 1.55 percent in 2018. But with anti-government “yellow vests” protests showing no signs of abating in France, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne urged motorway operators last week to avoid sending a negative signal to drivers.
Companies such as Sanef, owned by Spain's Abertis,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and  Eiffage  (PA:FOUG) that run the French highways pay for road upgrades with tariff hikes, which are reviewed once a year and agreed with the government.
""Tariff hikes in February should not be challenged but the government is asking for solutions to cushion the impact on frequent users,"" a Sanef spokeswoman said during a press lunch.
""In order to participate in the global effort on purchasing power... We will for instance offer new home-to-work subscription formulas,"" she said.
Motorway operators were given 10 days to come up with proposals and are expected to meet with the Transport Minister next week.
The ""yellow vests"" - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists must have in their cars - have blocked roads and roundabouts across France since mid-November, sometimes occupying highway tolls and setting a number on fire.
The demonstrations began as a protest against fuel tax increases, but have morphed into a wider backlash against the liberal economic policies of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Sanef has yet to estimate the damages it had incurred but larger operator Vinci has said destruction since the start of the protests will cost it ""several tens of millions"" of euros, not including lost revenue, as the protesters have allowed thousands of motorists onto the highways for free.

Vinci, however, dropped a plan to send invoices to motorists who drove through toll booths without paying and whose license plates were captured on cameras, following government criticism.

Such fuel theft has dropped from 787 truck loads per day to 177 since thousands of soldiers were sent to state-oil company Pemex's installations last month, Lopez Obrador said at a daily news conference.
The crackdown on years of mounting fuel theft is the leftist government's first major move against corruption and violence after taking office on Dec. 1, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. 
By closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages, the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-manufacturing hub in central Mexico.
Criminal groups and others who have tapped pipelines have long been blamed for billions of dollars of losses to public coffers over the past few years, but Lopez Obrador said last month that far more fuel was being stolen directly from Pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials.
Lopez Obrador said the military had discovered a 3-kilometer (1.9 mile)-long ""hose"" that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato into a secret storage area.
He admitted there were complaints about the shortages, but said they were not widespread, and urged an end to ""panic"" buying and said shortages were an issue of distribution, not supply.
""This is not in vain,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""We are going to end corruption."" 
Local media showed images of tanker trucks, escorted by federal police, heading from oil-rich costal states to the country's interior.

It was not immediately clear what impact the crackdown will have on imports of fuel. Mexico is the top export destination for U.S. energy products, importing about 1.4 million barrels every day, or nearly a quarter of all U.S. overseas sales.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",China gives long-awaited GM crop approvals amid U.S. trade talks,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China approved five genetically modified (GM) crops for import on Tuesday, the first in about 18 months in a move that could boost its overseas grains purchases and ease pressure from the United States to open its markets to more farm goods. 
The United States is the world's biggest producer of GM crops, while China is the top importer of GM soybeans and canola. 
U.S. farmers and global seed companies have long complained about Beijing's slow and unpredictable process for approving GM crops for import, stoking trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The approvals, announced on the agriculture ministry's website, were granted while a U.S. trade delegation is meeting with its counterparts in the Chinese capital this week.
""It's a goodwill gesture toward the resolution of the trade issue,"" said a China representative of a U.S. agricultural industry association.
""It's been in the system for a long time but they chose today to release this good news,"" he added, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The approved products included DowDuPont Inc's (N:DWDP) DP4114 Qrome corn and DAS-44406-6 soybean, known as Enlist E3, as well as the SYHT0H2 soybean developed by Bayer CropScience and Syngenta  but now held by German chemical company BASF.
The other two newly approved products - BASF's RF3 canola and Bayer-owned (DE:BAYGn) Monsanto's glyphosate-tolerant MON 88302 canola - had been waiting six years for permission. 
The approvals came as farmers in North America were deciding which seeds to plant this spring. China before the trade war bought some 60 percent of U.S. soybeans and U.S. farmers do not widely plant varieties it has not approved.
The newly approved canola will allow farmers in Canada to boost production, according to Jim Everson, president of industry group the Canola Council. 
""The industry expects growers will produce $400 million more canola every year using the same amount of land - a step-change for canola productivity,"" Everson said in a statement.
Five other products known to be seeking approvals were not given the green light, including two GM alfalfa products developed by  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) and two DowDuPont soybean traits.
Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture unit of DowDuPont, said, ""We are happy to see the regulatory approval of our seed traits progressing in China.""
Bayer said in a statement it welcomed the news but noted ""many of these products were stuck in China’s regulatory process for many years and others were not granted approvals, underscoring the need for continued improvement in China’s regulatory processes."" 
Chinese officials met their U.S. counterparts in Beijing on Monday for the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled global markets.
China had not approved any GM crops for import since July 2017, when it cleared two products following high-level talks with Washington. It also approved two products in June 2017.
China's scientific advisory board on GM crops met in June but did not give the go-ahead for imports of any products.
""China's approval of the new GMO products is paving the way for China to import large volumes of U.S. soybeans in the future. It is a positive signal,"" said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.
The truce in the Sino-U.S. trade war prompted a resumption of U.S. soybean purchases. Buying had slumped after China imposed a 25 percent import duty on U.S. shipments of oilseed on July 6 in response to U.S. tariffs.
ONLY A FRACTION
China does not allow the planting of genetically modified food crops, but imports of GM crops such as soybeans and corn for animal feed are fine.
The country, the world's biggest soybean consumer, has so far purchased only about 5 million tonnes of the 2018 U.S. soy harvest, a fraction of its typical purchases. 
The United States has demanded that China change its GM crop import application process to make it more transparent, timely and based on scientific methods. 
The latest approvals should not be taken as a sign that China is conceding to those demands, said a China-based industry source, who also asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""It's another piece of evidence that China's approval process is not entirely scientific but political,"" said the source, who also believed the approvals were timed for the trade visit. 

The ministry also announced on Tuesday the extension of import approvals for 26 other GM crops by a further three years.

The department was informed about director Taylor Simonin's suspension last month on a company call, sources told the Journal.
The credit card issuer received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice late October and is also being investigated by other federal agencies for pricing practices at its foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) unit.
The unit offers cross-border payments services mainly to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States.
FXIP accounts for less than 1 percent of AmEx's total revenue and the company does not expect the investigation to hurt overall operations or results.
A spokesperson for AmEx declined to comment on the matter, saying ""this is an ongoing review, we do not comment on any personnel issues, whether related to FXIP or not"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's civil aviation watchdog will issue an advanced safety management protocol in one week for airlines operating Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with the troubled Pratt & Whitney engines, the civil aviation secretary told Reuters on Tuesday.
Low-cost airlines IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), and GoAir operate these aircraft in India.
Ministry officials and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation met with executives from IndiGo, GoAir, aircraft maker Airbus (PA:AIR) and engine maker Pratt & Whitney to discuss the ongoing issues with the engines that have led to several planes being grounded in recent months.
Authorities have identified five issues broadly with engines out of which Pratt & Whitney has taken corrective action on four of them, R.N. Choubey said, adding Pratt is working on resolving the fifth issue related to the gear box.

Measures such as grounding of existing planes and halting the induction of new A320neo aircraft are not needed as of now, Choubey added.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. plans to remove sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486) will be of limited benefit to consumers in the United States where tariffs on aluminum imports mean producers still need much higher prices to incentivize shipments.
The U.S. Treasury has said it would lift sanctions on Rusal this month after a restructuring that reduces tycoon Oleg Deripaska's stake in parent company EN+  to below 50 percent.
Rusal, however, supplied only around 10 percent of the U.S. market in 2017. Canada with a more than 50 percent share is the largest supplier, and all producers still face 10 percent taxes on shipments to the United States.
""The tariffs will be paid by American consumers and the only winners are American primary (aluminum) producers who do not have to pay the duty,"" a source at an aluminum producer said. ""We can't sell at a loss, premiums for exporting to the U.S. need to stay high."" 
Physical market premiums are paid above the benchmark price for aluminum , set on the London Metal Exchange at around $1,870 a ton. That is down more than 30 percent from a seven-year high of $2,718 a ton hit in April, when the sanctions were imposed.
(GRAPHIC: Aluminum premiums - https://tmsnrt.rs/2H1CVvw) 
The U.S. premium  at 19 U.S. cents a lb or $420 a ton is little changed from Dec. 20 when the U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions would be lifted. 
It is double the $200 a ton seen at the start of 2018 and about 20 percent above the levels at the time tariffs were announced in early March 2018.
""There is a little downside on U.S. premiums. The February contract is around $400 a ton,"" said Eoin Dinsmore, an analyst at metals consultancy CRU. ""That's the kind of level needed to take into account the duties, to attract metal.""
In contrast, premiums in Europe <1AEPc1>, a major destination for Rusal's aluminum, have tumbled to $60 a ton, from the record high of $150 a ton seen in the aftermath of the sanctions.
Aluminum industry sources say commodity traders are holding large amounts of Rusal's metal produced since April in Europe and that consumers on the continent are holding ample stocks. 
PRODUCERS NEED U.S. MARKET
U.S. premium contracts beyond February show <0#AUP:> a steady slide to $360 a ton by December 2019.
However, some expect to see even lower numbers as the United States is a major consumer expected to account for 5 million-6 million tons this year in a market estimated at 68 million tons.
""The U.S. needs to attract imports, but producers also need the U.S. market and they have to compete with duty-exempt material,"" said Citi analyst Oliver Nugent.
""We're expecting some of the cost of the tariff to be pushed back to producers, we're bearish on the U.S. premium.""
Canadian exemptions from the tariffs are also behind the idea of premiums sliding at a faster rate than expected. 
""The stand-off centers on whether Canada should accept imports being capped by a fixed quota,"" Nugent said. 
""Even if Canada is forced to take the quota agreement, a substantial portion of previously duty paying import supply becomes duty-free overnight.""

(This corrects spelling of Deripaska, paragraph 2.)

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>","Exclusive: New documents link Huawei to suspected front companies in Iran, Syria","By Steve Stecklow, Babak Dehghanpisheh and James Pomfret
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. case against the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Canada last month, centers on the company's suspected ties to two obscure companies. One is a telecom equipment seller that operated in Tehran; the other is that firm's owner, a holding company registered in Mauritius.
U.S. authorities allege CFO Meng Wanzhou deceived international banks into clearing transactions with Iran by claiming the two companies were independent of Huawei, when in fact Huawei controlled them. Huawei has maintained the two are independent: equipment seller Skycom Tech Co Ltd and shell company Canicula Holdings Ltd.
But corporate filings and other documents found by Reuters in Iran and Syria show that Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, is more closely linked to both firms than previously known.
The documents reveal that a high-level Huawei executive appears to have been appointed Skycom's Iran manager. They also show that at least three Chinese-named individuals had signing rights for both Huawei and Skycom bank accounts in Iran. Reuters also discovered that a Middle Eastern lawyer said Huawei conducted operations in Syria through Canicula.
The previously unreported ties between Huawei and the two companies could bear on the U.S. case against Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, by further undermining Huawei's claims that Skycom was merely an arms-length business partner.
Huawei, U.S. authorities assert, retained control of Skycom, using it to sell telecom equipment to Iran and move money out via the international banking system. As a result of the deception, U.S. authorities say, banks unwittingly cleared hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions that potentially violated economic sanctions Washington had in place at the time against doing business with Iran.
Meng did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters, and Huawei declined to answer questions for this story. Canicula's offices could not be reached. A Justice Department spokesman in Washington declined to comment.
Meng was released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail on Dec. 11 and remains in Vancouver while Washington tries to extradite her. In the United States, Meng would face charges in connection with an alleged conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge. The exact charges have not been made public.
Huawei said last month it has been given little information about the U.S. allegations ""and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng."" The company has described its relationship with Skycom as ""a normal business partnership."" It has said it has fully complied with all laws and regulations and required Skycom to do the same.
Meng's arrest on a U.S. warrant has caused an uproar in China. It comes at a time of growing trade and military tensions between Washington and Beijing, and amid worries by U.S. intelligence that Huawei's telecommunications equipment could contain ""backdoors"" for Chinese espionage. The firm has repeatedly denied such claims. Nevertheless, Australia and New Zealand recently banned Huawei from building their next generation of mobile phone networks, and British authorities have also expressed concerns.

Reuters reported that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. At least 13 pages of the proposal were marked ""Huawei confidential"" and carried Huawei's logo. Huawei has said neither it nor Skycom ultimately provided the U.S. equipment.
Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009.
Several banks questioned Huawei about the Reuters articles, according to court documents filed by Canadian authorities at the request of the U.S. for Meng's bail hearing in Vancouver last month.
According to the documents, U.S. investigators allege that in responding to the banks, which weren't named, Meng and other Huawei employees ""repeatedly lied"" about the company's relationship with Skycom and failed to disclose that ""Skycom was entirely controlled by Huawei."" U.S. authorities also allege that at a private meeting with a bank executive, in or about August 2013, Meng said Huawei had sold its shares in Skycom, but didn't disclose that the buyer was ""a company also controlled by Huawei.""
The court documents allege that Huawei told the executive's bank that the Chinese company had sold its shares in Skycom in 2009 - the same year Meng stepped down from Skycom's board. Skycom's buyer wasn't identified in the documents.
But Skycom records filed in Hong Kong, where the company was registered, show that its shares were transferred in November 2007 to Canicula. Canicula, which was registered in Mauritius in 2006, continued to hold Skycom shares for about a decade, Skycom records show.
A ""Summary of Facts"" filed by U.S. authorities for Meng's Canadian bail hearing states: ""Documents and email records show that persons listed as 'Managing Directors' for Skycom were Huawei employees."" None of those individuals were named.
A company record filed by Skycom in Iran that was entered in the Iranian registry in December 2011 states that a ""Shi Yaohong"" had been elected as manager of Skycom's Iran branch for two years. Huawei employs an executive named Shi Yaohong.
According to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, Shi was named Huawei's ""President Middle East Region"" in June 2012. An Emirates News Agency press release identified him in November 2010 as ""President of Huawei Etisalat Key Account."" Etisalat is a major Middle Eastern telecommunications group and a Huawei partner.
Shi, now president of Huawei's software business unit, hung up the phone when Reuters asked him about his relationship with Skycom.
Many corporate records filed by Skycom in Iran list signatories for its bank accounts in the country. Most of the names are Chinese; at least three of the individuals had signing rights for both Skycom and Huawei bank accounts. (One of the names is listed in the Iranian registry with two slightly different spellings but has the same passport number.) U.S. authorities allege in the court documents filed in Canada that Huawei employees were signatories on Skycom bank accounts between 2007 and 2013.
Records in Hong Kong show that Skycom was voluntarily liquidated in June 2017 and that Canicula was paid about $132,000 as part of the resolution. The liquidator, Chan Leung Lee, of BDO Ltd in Hong Kong, declined to comment.
The Financial Services Commission in Mauritius, where Canicula remains registered, declined to release any of its records to Reuters, saying they were confidential.
SYRIAN CONNECTION
Until two years ago, Canicula had an office in Syria, another country that has been subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions. In May 2014, a Middle Eastern business website called Aliqtisadi.com published a brief article about the dissolution of a Huawei company in Syria that specialized in automated teller machine (ATM) equipment. Osama Karawani, an attorney who was identified as the appointed liquidator, wrote a letter asking for a correction, stating that the article had caused ""serious damage"" to Huawei.
Karawani said the article suggested that Huawei itself had been dissolved, not just the ATM company. In his letter, which was linked to on the Aliqtisadi website, he said Huawei was still in business.
""Huawei was never dissolved,"" he wrote; he added that it ""has been and is still operating in Syria through several companies which are Huawei Technologies Ltd and Canicula Holdings Ltd."" Huawei Technologies is one of Huawei's main operating companies.
Karawani didn't respond to emailed questions from Reuters about Canicula.
U.S. investigators are aware of Canicula's connection to Syria, according to a person familiar with the probe. Canicula had an office in Damascus and operated in Syria on behalf of Huawei, another person said.
That person said Canicula's customers there included three major telecommunications companies. One is MTN Syria, controlled by South Africa's MTN Group Ltd, which has mobile-phone operations in both Syria and Iran. MTN has a joint venture in Iran – MTN Irancell – that is also a Huawei customer. MTN advised Huawei on setting up the structure of Skycom's office in Iran, according to another source familiar with the matter.
""Skycom was just a front"" for Huawei, the person said.
An official with MTN said no one at the company was available to comment.

In December 2017, a notice was placed in a Syrian newspaper by ""the General Director of the branch of the company Canicula Ltd."" He was not named. It announced that Canicula had ""totally stopped operating"" in Syria two months before. No explanation was given.

1608,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>","Risk Is Back as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Signal Bullish Way Out","(Bloomberg) -- Investors and strategists who shunned risk, from stocks and credit to emerging markets, are cracking the door back open.
From BNP Paribas Wealth Management in Paris to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). in New York, they’re rejecting market signals that developed economies are on the verge of tipping into recession. Bargain prices, emerging compromises on trade, stimulus in China and even Brexit offer potential reasons for cheer.
“The markets have been digesting bad political uncertainties last year and just the end of it will be a relief for all risky assets on a global basis,” Florent Brones, chief investment officer of BNP Paribas Wealth Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Fundamentals are still okay, but political uncertainties are weighing on the moment for risky assets. It will not last forever.”
After a year in which almost every asset class ended in the red, investors are caught between hysteria over an oncoming downturn -- as pockets of the U.S. yield-curve invert -- and real-economy evidence to the contrary. The best employment report in 10 months helped soothe nerves on Friday.
“On the fundamentals, we have just a slowdown in terms of economic growth and earnings growth but the markets are pricing in more than that -- they are pricing in a recession,” Brones said. “We think this recession will not occur.”
He reckons beaten-up value stocks and emerging markets are poised to recover as investors stage a tentative return.
‘Room for a Rally’
Goldman Sachs believes investors need to jump on any relief rebound spurred by positive policy or data surprises -- fast.
“If, as we expect, global economies slow but avoid recession in 2019, and U.S. interest rates peak, there should be room for a risk rally,” strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note. “There is a risk that investors who miss any rally could lose out on the bulk of the returns on offer this year.”
Even uber-bears at Morgan Stanley are entertaining a bull case for global risk. Credit strategists at the bank this week lightened up on a long-held underweight recommendation on U.S. corporate bonds, citing the sharp dip in sentiment of late.
Of course, many investors may find it hard to turn their radars to the feel-good vibes, considering the bearish signals that keep ambushing them. Tuesday’s shock drop in German industrial activity at the tail end of 2018 is a warning that Europe is at risk of a recession. A factory reading in China came in at the lowest since May 2017.
Morgan Stanley cross-asset strategists caution that the elements for the uptrend “aren’t yet aligned, but could be by the end of 1Q.” And they’re not ready to put a buy recommendation on risk yet, remaining neutral equities, neutral global rates, underweight credit and overweight cash.
Return of Risk Appetite
All the same, there are plenty of smart investors betting risk appetite will normalize soon enough. Low-volatility stocks, for example, are outperforming while high-yield credit and emerging-market currencies are recovering.
And the flip-side to bets on weaker U.S. growth momentum -- a cheaper dollar -- is helping to ease financial conditions from 2016 highs. Goldman Sachs and Nomura Holdings are both bearish on the currency.
Here’s one bullish playbook laid out by Morgan Stanley:"
1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>","Gold-backed ETFs gained globally in 2018, even with North America outflows","By Renita D. Young
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold-backed exchange-traded funds ended 2018 with new inflows globally as uncertainty about Britain's exit from the EU drove investors to the perceived safety of European-backed ETFs, more than offsetting outflows in North America resulting from a strong U.S. dollar. 
Gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide registered net inflows of $3.4 billion, a 3 percent annual rise and increased by 69 tonnes to 2,440 tonnes in the year. 
This was the first year since 2012 that total gold-backed ETF holdings finished above $100 billion, at $100.6 billion, according to the World Gold Council.
Europe-based funds grew 10 percent during 2018, or by 96.8 tonnes worth $4.5 billion, with Germany leading country inflows and UK-based funds following as concerns increased about Brexit. 
North American gold-backed ETFs experienced outflows in 2018, as gold prices weakened during the third quarter, the World Gold Council said. Holdings in North American gold-backed ETFs declined 1.3 percent by 13.4 tonnes worth $667.4 million. 
Volatile stock markets in the fourth quarter drew some investors back to gold. During times of uncertainty, the precious metal is seen as a safe-haven alternative to stocks and other comparatively risky assets.
In August, spot gold prices  hit their lowest in more than 19 months, with the U.S. dollar holding steady near a recent peak as concerns about a Turkey crisis and China's economic health weighed on emerging market currencies.
Gold prices and North American gold ETF flows turned positive in October when stock markets worldwide had their worst October since the 2008 financial crisis.
Spot gold prices ended the year down 1.5 percent from the previous year after rallying from August lows.

In December alone, gold-backed ETFs globally rose 3 percent, adding 76 tonnes worth $3.1 billion, for a third-straight month of net inflows, largely driven by North American and European investment, World Gold Council data showed.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>","MetLife names Khalaf CEO, Kandarian to retire","(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (N:MET) on Tuesday named insider Michel Khalaf as its new chief executive officer to succeed Steven Kandarian, who held the position for eight years and helped the company ride through intense regulatory oversight in the wake of the financial crisis.
Khalaf, who headed the company's U.S. and EMEA business, will move into the new role on May 1 after Kandarian retires, MetLife said in a statement.
The new CEO takes over at a time when insurers are bracing for elevated payouts to owners of long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirmed and elderly customers, forcing them to boost reserves.
Khalaf joined MetLife in 2010, after the company bought American Life Insurance Company (Alico) from American International Group (N:AIG) in 2010. Khalaf worked with Alico for more than two decades in several leadership roles across the world.
Under Kandarian's leadership, MetLife spun off its longtime business that sold individual life insurance into a new company called  Brighthouse Financial  (O:BHF) in 2017. The aim was to boost the insurer's share price, besides creating a more nimble company that was less sensitive to interest rates.
Kandarian also pushed for removal of MetLife's ""systemically important"" designation, better known as ""too big to fail"", a tag that triggers heightened regulatory oversight and requires companies to hold on to more capital.
Up to Monday's close, MetLife's shares have fallen more than 15 percent since the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial. The stock was up 1.3 percent in early trading on Tuesday.

The New York-based insurer reported a profit of $880 million in its latest quarter, compared with a loss of $97 million a year ago due to a charge related to its spin-off.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Forest fire insurance costs soar,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Forest fires are becoming increasingly likely because of climate change and costing insurers more than ever, with the deadly fire that ravaged northern California the single most expensive natural disaster in 2018, Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) said on Tuesday.
The California wildfire that devastated the small town of Paradise in November caused losses of $16.5 billion, of which $12.5 billion were insured, according to the reinsurer's annual catastrophe report. 
Worldwide natural disasters caused $160 billion in economic damage in 2018. That was down from $350 billion the previous year, but a number of devastating hurricanes had contributed to the high losses in 2017.
Insurers and reinsurers paid out $80 billion for natural disaster claims last year, down from $140 billion a year earlier but almost double the 30-year average of $41 billion, the reinsurer said.
Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek said that 2018 was marked by several severe natural disasters with high insured losses.
""These include the unusual coincidence of severe cyclones in the U.S. and Japan, and devastating forest fires in California,"" he said, adding that climate change appears to be making such large fires more common.
Insurers spent $18 billion on two huge fires in the United States in 2018 - equivalent to one in every four dollars they paid out as a result of natural disasters.
Ernst Rauch, the reinsurer's chief climatologist, told Reuters that forest fires were entering a whole new dimension, costing tens of billions of dollars. 
""Higher and higher temperatures are leading to ever greater droughts, and high humidity in the winter means that shrubbery grows quickly, creating an easily flammable material in dry summers,"" he said.
Rauch said it was questionable whether areas at high risk could continue to be populated without taking additional measures, such as building houses further from forests and with better safety standards.
In Europe, an unusually hot summer caused a drought that wrought considerable damage on the agricultural sector and was the continent's most expensive natural disaster at $3.9 billion. However, only a fraction of those losses were insured. 
Reinsurers act as a financial backstop to insurance companies, paying a chunk of the big claims for storms or earthquakes in exchange for part of the policy premiums.
Hurricanes and typhoons caused $56 billion of damage last year. Hurricane Michael, which wrought devastation in Florida, was the most expensive for insurers, causing losses of $10 billion.

The review gave no claims figures for Munich Re itself. The reinsurer is due to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 6.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",PG&E falls further after S&P cuts credit rating to junk,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp's shares fell 14 percent on Tuesday, after S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) stripped the California power company of its investment-grade credit rating in the face of massive claims stemming from deadly wildfires.
S&P cut the rating on PG&E and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit on Monday to ""B"" from ""BBB-,"" the lowest tier of so-called investment-grade ratings, citing political and regulatory pressure and uncertainty over its potential liabilities. 
The utility, whose roughly $18 billion in bonds fell on Monday due to bankruptcy fears, has come under severe pressure since a fatal Camp fire in November compounded its woes. It currently faces billions of dollars in liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
S&P Global said it could further cut the company's rating over the next few months if explicit steps are not taken by authorities to improve the regulatory situation, signaling that the agency may be losing faith that lawmakers could rescue PG&E.
""We could also lower the ratings by one or more notches if management does not clearly articulate specific steps it will take to preserve credit quality over the long term,"" S&P said.
On Monday, PG&E shares dived more than 22 percent and its largest bond, a $3 billion note due in March 2034 with a coupon of 6.05 percent, fell to a record-low bid price of 91.5 cents on the dollar, while its yield rose to nearly 7 percent.
""We expect that negative public sentiment and the increased political pressure will challenge the regulators' willingness and ability to implement measures to protect credit quality over the near term,"" S&P said.
The agency also said it expects PG&E's capital access may be limited to secured debt issuance, restricting its financing options due to increased credit risks and media speculation on a potential bankruptcy.
Reuters reported on Friday citing sources that PG&E was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection. The company was considering the move, for some or all of its businesses, as it fears a massive charge in the fourth quarter related to potential liabilities from wildfires.
The company said it was reviewing its ""structural options"" and assessing its operations, finances, management, structure and governance. It is also searching for new directors at its holding company and its utility unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
In November, PG&E said it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused last year's fires in northern California.
Credit ratings for PG&E and its Pacific Gas & Electric unit were downgraded by the three main ratings agencies in mid-November.
Last month, the California Public Utilities Commission opened a proceeding to consider penalties against the company, ordering immediate action against the utility for falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines.
Shares of the company were down at $16.32 in early trading.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) rose 8 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the No.1 U.S. railroad named https://www.up.com/media/releases/190107-jim-vena.htm industry veteran Jim Vena as chief operating officer, prompting upgrades by several brokerages.
Vena worked with the late Hunter Harrison, an industry expert who pioneered a strategy called ""precision scheduling railroading"" (PSR) to make railroads operate more efficiently and profitable.
Harrison used the strategy to steer turnarounds at railroads including Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR), and Vena, 60, played a key role in implementing the plan at the Canadian company, analysts said.
Union Pacific, which connects 23 states in western United States, has struggled with service problems and congestion on its rail network, leading it to issue a profitability warning for 2019. 
The company on Oct. 1 adopted the PSR plan to improve efficiency and ease congestion, aiming to boost profitability by 2020.
""We were previously skeptical on UNP's likelihood of successfully implementing PSR and key to that skepticism was the absence of a C-suite manager with PSR experience,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin.
""With a seasoned PSR veteran now in the COO role, we expect dramatic changes will occur at UNP,"" added Spracklin, upgrading the stock to ""outperform"" from ""sector perform"" and raising his price target to $179 from $151. 
Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl said the appointment gives it more confidence in the company's ability to ""successfully implement its version of PSR"", raising his price target to $178 from $153.
Vena, 60, will take charge on Jan. 14, the company said.

(Reuters) - The clock may be fast running out on Sears Holdings Corp, but you wouldn't know it from the company's feisty posts on Twitter.
""We are down, but not out... - SMT,"" Sears, via its official Twitter account (@Sears), said in reply to one of the many posts Monday morning about the 126-year-old company potentially going out of business.
The optimistic tweets come ahead of a hearing on Tuesday, where Sears will ask a U.S. bankruptcy judge if it can proceed with liquidation after it failed to reach a deal on Chairman Edward Lampert's $4.4 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another Twitter user opined that the retailer ""had a good run I would say."" Sears replied: ""We would say that as well, but we are Marathon Runners, and we are still running. We may be slowing down, but we are not out of the race just yet. Don't count us completely out. Happy Shopping! -SMT""
The ""SMT"" sign-off is for the Sears Social Media Team that runs the Twitter account, which has a following of 209,000, significantly smaller than many of its retail peers. 
The company declined to comment on its social media strategy.
In the face of competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears has struggled to reinvent itself.
Sears' former Chief Marketing Officer Kelly Cook told Reuters at the end of 2017 that the company planned to invest more heavily in social media in 2018.
Cook said marketing directly to shoppers via Twitter and Instagram posts and influencers could help change consumer sentiment toward Sears. The company also planned to use shoppers' opinions to make operational and merchandising changes, she said.
However, only 9 percent of U.S. millennials - aged between 22 to 37 years in 2018 - said they would consider buying goods from the retailer, according YouGov BrandIndex, a company that tracks public perception of brands. 
On Monday, Sears encouraged those saddened by its store closures to shop online. ""Thank you for the picture! It is very surreal,"" the account tweeted at a user who posted a picture of a Sears store striped of inventory, one of many to shutter its doors. ""Here's to ONLINE shopping for everyone! -SMT""
Over the last 30 days, Sears’ posting frequency on Twitter has gone up by the week, as have interactions per post, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.
Toys 'R' Us took a slightly different tack to reach its nearly 2 million followers on Twitter. 
""While our store roster may be getting smaller, what is not changing is our desire or commitment to serving you,"" Toys 'R' Us (@ToysRUs) tweeted from its official account in February 2018, roughly five months after it filed for bankruptcy protection.
""We will continue to operate stores in all major markets and as always, you can also continue to shop online. Thank you!"" 
Then, in March, Toys 'R' Us announced it would sell or close all 885 stores in its U.S. chain, after failing to restructure billions of dollars in debt.
Nearly three months after filing for bankruptcy in October, Sears has made plans to sell its vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures, sources told Reuters on Sunday. 
Lampert's bid is meant to preserve 425 Sears stores and up to 50,000 jobs across the United States. A liquidation would put roughly 68,000 people that Sears now employs out of work.

""If Sears liquidates, it'd be very, very sad for all of us,"" said longtime Sears vendor Joe Shamie, CEO of furniture vendor Delta Children, which lost millions after Toys 'R' Us filed for bankruptcy.

The Marshal Vasilevskiy FSRU has been set up in Kaliningrad, wedged between European Union members Poland and Lithuania, by Russian energy giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) to bypass pipeline gas deliveries via Lithuania in case transit is disrupted. 
Moscow's decision to set up the FSRU was in part to reduce gas transit risks to Kaliningrad, home to a Baltic Fleet base, as the EU steps up efforts to reduce its dependency on Russia, a Kremlin-published transcript of Putin's speech said.
""In recent years we have paid much attention to energy supplies, to the energy of the region as a whole, including in connection with EU plans to remove the Baltic states from Russia's energy ring,"" Putin said.
""This is their (EU countries') business. Additional tax payers' money will be invested into that.""
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the Interfax news agency that supplies to Kaliningrad from Lithuania had been completely halted on Tuesday and replaced with natural gas from the FSRU.
The FSRU, the first of its kind in Russia which arrived from Singapore last month with a cargo on board to commission the LNG import facility, can provide Kaliningrad with 2.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, Gazprom has said.

LNG is delivered by tankers, meaning it can be supplied to many markets.

1647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",A PG&E Bankruptcy Would Leave Utility in Turmoil for Years,"(Bloomberg) -- The lights would stay on if California utility giant PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG) files for bankruptcy. But the company, its customers and investors would be set for years of uncertainty.
While utility bankruptcies are rare, they can result in anything from a healthy company to a breakup, with business units sold off like spare parts. For consumers, the fallout likely means higher rates.
PG&E plunged Monday on news that it’s exploring a bankruptcy filing in response to an onslaught of wildfire liabilities that are estimated to be as high as $30 billion -- far exceeding the company’s roughly $10 billion market value. Later Monday, S&P Global Ratings downgraded PG&E’s long-term credit rating to junk, and said the utility remains on a negative watch.
A potential bankruptcy is seen as putting pressure on California lawmakers to provide a bailout and avoid more turmoil for the state’s largest utility. Whatever the outcome, bankruptcy tends to be “massively inefficient,” said Severin Borenstein, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley.
“It freezes the company,” he said. “A judge who has no expertise essentially becomes the CEO. And there are these committees that get involved in every corporate decision.”
PG&E has been here before.
The San Francisco-based company’s Pacific Gas and Electric utility filed for bankruptcy in 2001 as soaring wholesale power prices and rolling blackouts threw California into crisis. The PG&E Corp. holding company itself never filed for bankruptcy. The utility emerged three years later, its business intact. Under the reorganization plan, ratepayers were responsible for $7.2 billion of the company’s debt from the electricity crisis.
Rare Occurrences
Bankruptcy filings tend to be rare for electric utilities because they have large and steady revenue streams. But there have been other cases. El Paso Electric, for example, filed for Chapter 11 in 1992, due largely to expenses tied to the Palo Verde nuclear plant. The Texas company exited bankruptcy court four years later with a new rate plan that let it recoup its costs.
Not every bankrupt utility has fared as well.
Last year, Energy Future Holdings Corp. was forced to sell off its electricity distribution business in Texas to  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) as part of a tortuous four-year bankruptcy proceeding. And the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to mounting debts, now plans to hire a private operator to manage its electricity grid.
The Puerto Rico utility’s corporate disarray left it ill-prepared when Hurricane Maria slammed into the island in 2017 -- something California leaders would have to weigh in a PG&E bankruptcy as they face the prospect of another fire season with a power company in dire financial straits.
Different Issues
PG&E hasn’t commented publicly on the prospect of bankruptcy and didn’t have immediate comment for this story. While the company does have experience navigating the Chapter 11 process, the problems it faces now are far different from those in 2001.
Then, unscrupulous energy traders and companies -- most notably, Enron Corp. -- exploited flaws in California’s recently restructured electricity market to send wholesale power prices soaring. Utilities, their rates regulated by the state, couldn’t pass those cost increases on to their customers. At the time of the filing, PG&E’s debts were reported to be rising by $300 million per month.
This time, PG&E’s travails are tied to the role its power lines may have played in fires that killed dozens of people. In California, utilities can be held liable for damages even if they aren’t found to be negligent.
State investigators have blamed PG&E’s equipment for starting 17 of the wildfires that tore across Northern California in October 2017. Those investigators are now exploring whether a PG&E transmission line started November’s Camp Fire, which leveled the Butte County town of Paradise and left 86 people dead.
Since then, state regulators accused the utility owner of breaking natural gas pipeline-safety rules and falsifying records. And now PG&E says it’s weighing changes to its board and how its businesses are structured.
“This will now require a significant amount of time for the company to re-earn the trust of its stakeholders,” S&P said in a statement late Monday, explaining its decision to downgrade PG&E to B from BBB-. “These conditions may significantly limit the company’s options including its ability to consistently finance or safely operate its businesses.”
Political Pressure
California politicians have been considering legislation that would help PG&E pay off lawsuits related to the Camp Fire, and one veteran lawmaker has publicly questioned whether the company was using the specter of bankruptcy to pressure Sacramento. In 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric filed for bankruptcy while bailout talks with then-Governor Gray Davis were well underway. Davis, blindsided by the filing, called it a “slap in the face to California,” according to local reports at the time.
The company emerged from that bankruptcy without major structural changes and with its top management intact. A filing now may result in a harsher outcome, said Mark Toney, director of the Utility Reform Network consumer group. PG&E saw its reputation badly tarnished by the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion, which led to six criminal convictions against the company.
“Last time, PG&E was able to portray itself as an innocent victim, and there were bigger actors that were gaming the market, that were lying, stealing and cheating,” Toney said. “Now, I think the feeling is completely different. They are a convicted felon.”

1648,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Starwood Property Trust STWD,"My favorite conservative stock pick for the coming year is Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (STWD), a finance REIT whose primary business is the origination of commercial property mortgages, asserts income specialist Tim Plaehn, editor of The Dividend Hunter.
As one of the largest players in the field, Starwood Property trust focuses on making large loans with specialized terms. This gives them a competitive advantage over banks and smaller commercial finance REITs.
Over the last several years, the company has diversified its business, branching into commercial mortgage servicing, acquiring real equity properties with long term revenue stability, and recently a portfolio of energy project finance debt. This diversification will allow Starwood Property Trust to thrive and continue to pay the big dividend in any financial environment.
In the commercial loan business, over 95% of the commercial mortgage portfolio has adjustable interest rates. This means that as the Fed increases interest rates, Starwood’s net income per share will grow. This REIT provides an excellent hedge against rising rates.
In recent years, the company has acquired what is now the largest commercial mortgage servicing firm. That arm of the business handles servicing, foreclosure workouts (for fees) and the packaging of smaller commercial mortgages into mortgage backed securities. This business segment would see the fees increase exponentially in the event of a recession where commercial property owners were forced to let go back to the lenders.
 In addition to the finance side of the company, Starwood has acquired selected real properties, including apartments, regular office buildings, and medical office campuses. According to STWD’s CEO, “All of the wholly-owned assets in this segment continues to perform well with blended cash-on-cash yields increasing to 11.4% and weighted average occupancy remain steady at 98%.”
The property segment provides assets with long-life revenue streams to offset the shorter-term rollover schedule of the commercial mortgage portfolio. Real assets also add depreciation to the income statement, shielding cash flow.
In mid-2018 the company acquired a $2.5 billion energy finance business from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). The loan book is non-recourse to Starwood Property Trust. Starwood Capital, the private equity manager of STWD, already had energy finance experts in house. This business segment has significant potential for growth.
This diversification of business segments by Starwood Property Trust is what separates this commercial finance REIT from its more narrowly focused peers. STWD has paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend since the 2014 first quarter. My investment expectation is that the dividend is secure, and I want to earn the 8.5% to 8.8% dividend year-after-year.

NVDA,"Nvidia (NVDA) is a leader in the age of GPU computing; the company's graphics processing technology is a great fit for AI, robotics, and autonomous driving applications, explains Jim Kelleher, analyst with Argus Research, a leading independent Wall Street research firm.
There are multiple paths to growth. Gaming (53% revenue); Turing GeForce cards have introduced RTX raytracing technology (lifelike light & shadow). Data center (25% of revenue, growing 60%); the Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU is experiencing the fastest adoption of any server GPU.
The company’s data center business is supplying all “Super Seven” cloud titans. Auto is showing mid-teens growth, and about to explode with Pascal DRIVE Level 5. NVidia’s lean infrastructure and fast growth equate to explosive growth in cash flow.
After the “FANG 10” selloff, NVDA shares have become much more attractive. The stock is trading at 21-times two-year forward EPS, below the historical average multiple of 24.
The two-year forward relative P/E of 1.45 is close to the five-year average of 1.47; the PEG ratio of 1.0 is below the peer average of 2.0.
Our discounted free cash flow model (DFCF) points to a value in the low $300s, in a rising trend. Our blended valuation analysis — historical comparables, peer group, DFCF — supports values well above current levels. Our 12-month target price is $250.

1650,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Evrim Resources EVM,"For those comfortable with the inherent risks of a micro-cap stock, resource sector expert Adrian Day — editor of Global Analyst — looks to Evrim Resources (Toronto: EVM) as his top speculative idea for 2019.
Evrim Resources (Toronto: EVM) is a gold exploration company that employs the “prospect-generator” model. The means the company does early exploration, generating projects, and then seeks to bring in a partner to spend the big bucks in exchange for a majority of the project.
The advantage of this model is that bring in partners, the company avoids the major disadvantage of the typical exploration company, namely heavy and ongoing dilution in issuing new shares just to keep going. In the event of failure, the prospect generator can live to fight another day. For the investor, it’s like owning parts of several lottery tickets rather than all of just one.
Thus, Evrim has joint ventures on several projects with several different companies, including Newmont (which owns 19.9% of Evrim), Yamana and some juniors. There is active or near-term drilling on three different properties. And the company has a pipeline of other projects it could option out.
The buying opportunity comes to us courtesy of a nervous market that grossly overreacted to some disappointing drill results on the Cuale project in early December. It’s a long story; there was great anticipation about the drilling and many investors had bought shares ahead of the results.
We don’t need to go into too much detail since we are interested in the company and its business plan rather than any one project. But the weak results and stock tumble came as tax-loss selling seasons go underway, adding to the pressure of the stock.
Cuale is by no means dead, though the market is acting as though it is. Extraordinary high-grade trench results, plus reasonable gold and copper grades in drilling—just not rich enough nor frequent enough nor deep enough to satisfy expectations — nonetheless provide reasonable justification for continuing work on the project.
But without any consideration for Cuale, the current price discounts other assets in the company. The market cap is now C$26 million. Evrim has cash of about C$11 million, plus a royalty on Ermitano, which I estimate has a value of up to $30 million.
Even at a discount, the royalty and the cash together are more than the market cap of the entire company. The numerous joint ventures and earn-ins, including some with drilling underway, come free. If Cuale had never entered the picture, we would be buying Evrim at this price.

1651,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Starbucks SBUX,"Coffee drinkers don’t care about market corrections. Perhaps that’s why Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has come through the worst market correction in a decade not only unscathed, but in a better position (+10%) than it was when the downslide started in October, suggests Chris Preston, vice-president of content at Cabot Wealth Network.
For a stock to not just tread water but thrive over the last three months bodes well for its prospects as the market recovers. And that’s why Starbucks stock looks so attractive right now.
A big fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report in early November sent the stock gapping up from $58 to $68 in a week thanks to much-better-than-expected same-store sales, spurred in part by the recently introduced late-afternoon “happy hour” deals. While it has since pulled back to as low as $60, it remains comfortably above its 200-day moving average.
Where does the stock go from here? It’s already recovered nicely from its early-December pullback, and looks buyable below month-long resistance at $67. Any push above that level, especially if the market offers a tailwind instead of a headwind, and the stock could zoom past record highs.
Beyond that, the fundamentals look good — the stock trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 20 even after the recent run-up, and analysts anticipate 9.5% EPS growth and 5.6% sales growth in 2019.
Add in the positives in the chart, with both moving averages on the rise since late August, and there’s a lot to like about Starbucks heading into the new year. Starbucks might be just the wake-up call your portfolio needs after a three-month slumber!

1652,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Top Picks 2019- Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. BEP,"Pulled down by volatile oil prices, the Canadian dollar is now worth just 72 US cents, its lowest level since early 2016. The currency’s decline has pulled down the US dollar value of best in class Canadian stocks, explains Roger Conrad, editor of Conrad's Utility Investor.
That includes contract power producer Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP), our top conservative idea for the coming year.
The silver lining is another prime opportunity for conservative investors to lock in this company’s roughly 7.5 percent yield, which is reliably growing 5 to 8 percent a year. Brookfield’s stable growth is built on very solid, long-term foundations. That’s a major plus heading into uncertain 2019.
The company’s 17 gigawatts of power generating capacity and 8 GW development pipeline is almost entirely contracted to utilities and government entities. All of the facilities are among the least cost sources for their respective regions.
All of it is hydro, wind or solar, meaning current and future environmental concerns are minimal. And while output can vary with weather conditions, facilities also have long track records for reliability.
Second, Brookfield has a very strong financial position on its own with a BBB+ credit rating. And it has a very supportive general partner and 31 percent owner in A- rated Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). That backing has enabled Partners to make large acquisitions, while waiting on favorable capital markets to complete financing.
A case in point is the acquisition by family of 65.34 percent of yieldco TerraForm Power (TERP), which in turn allowed the latter to buy the former Saeta Yield. That deal will lift Brookfield’s funds from operations by 10 percent going forward.
Nor is the company a serial acquirer. Following the TerraForm deal and several other expansion moves such as European solar expansion, management announced CAD850 million in asset sales. That’s the latest installment of its “asset recycling program” to take advantage of global appetite for renewable energy facilities.
Those sales limit Brookfield’s need to access what have become hostile capital markets entering 2019. So will more than $700 million in guidance operating free cash flow after capital spending, an amount sufficient to cover rising dividends by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.
Brookfield Renewable is priced in Canadian dollars, though dividends are paid in US dollars. But improved oil prices should help currency become an upside driver in 2019, in addition to the high dividend and reliable dividend growth. Note the company now sends a K-1 at tax time, a possible inconvenience to taxable accounts more than offset by tax advantages. Buy up to $35.

Nevertheless one of my top picks for the coming year is ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), suggests Kelley Wright, dividend expert and editor of Investment Quality Trends.
Okay, so ExxonMobil is a massive company that isn’t very nimble, which makes sense when you’re talking about the equivalent of an aircraft carrier.
What ExxonMobil is though is competent and manages their vast assets with an eye always toward the future. I don’t see a recession on the horizon, let alone a depression, which ExxonMobil is priced at currently.
Economies sometime take a pause, which is normal and healthy. Also, unless there is some viable economic alternative to fossil fuel coming I’m not aware of, the world will continue to run on energy.
ExxonMobil's historically repetitive high-yield is 3.0%, which at the current cash dividend of $3.28 is realized at $109 per share. Trading recently at just over $69 per share with a dividend yield of 4.75%, the stock is an outstanding long-term value.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) operationally hit its main industrial target of 800 aircraft deliveries in 2018 after record handovers in December, two people briefed on the matter said. 
The final published number is subject to ongoing auditing checks, with raw delivery data standing on the 800 threshold, but Airbus is said to be optimistic that the European company has all but averted its first ever missed delivery goal.
The unofficial tally, a European record, includes the Canadian A220 recently taken over by Airbus and reflects a frenetic effort to catch up after engine delays and other snags.
It follows days of speculation over whether Airbus had managed to reach its main industrial goal, after cutting it in November due to gaps in engine supplies.
""It seems that they made it,"" said one of the people.
Airbus declined to comment.
Shares in the European planemaker fell sharply last week after earlier signs that Airbus was unlikely to meet the target, including a report that it had fallen short by up to 9 jets.
Industry sources had later said they did not rule out that Airbus would pull off a positive surprise as figures were compiled and audited. Airbus was due to publish full-year data on Friday but may bring this forward.
Airbus shares were up by 2.7 percent in mid-session trading.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) will publish its own data later on Tuesday and is expected to remain the world's largest planemaker for a seventh successive year after targeting 810-815 commercial deliveries.

The roll call of new orders was less clear after a late push by both sides but Boeing reached a book-to-bill ratio of 1 after grabbing more net orders than deliveries in 2018, sources said.

The government stepped in to support Carige after the Genoa-based bank was put under temporary administration by the European Central Bank last week following a failed attempt to raise private capital in December.
Carige said on Tuesday it would tap the state guarantee for funding adding however it was unlikely to turn to the government for capital. 
Under the terms of the decree, which reinstates a measure Italy adopted in the past to provide liquidity to the country's banks, the Treasury will guarantee bonds issued by Carige as well as funds the lender might borrow from the Bank of Italy.
Italy has also given Carige the option to apply for state aid under a ""precautionary recapitalization"" scheme used in the past to rescue rival Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), but Carige said this was ""a very marginal option."" 
The government's action marks a significant shift by the 5-Star Movement, which was highly critical of past decisions to use taxpayers' money to prop up struggling banks.
League leader Matteo Salvini defended the decision to intervene, which prompted accusations of hypocrisy from the opposition center-left.
""They only needed 10 minutes at a late-night cabinet meeting to disavow five years of lies and insults directed against us,"" former center-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Twitter.
Keen to prevent another collapse in Italy's battered banking sector, Italian banks in November came to Carige's rescue and provided second-tier capital by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond.
But the bank's top shareholder, the Malacalza family, in December blocked a new share issue of up to 400 million euros ($457.80 million) that would have been guaranteed by the bond's conversion into equity.

The unions, which are due to meet representatives of Ryanair on Tuesday morning, have not canceled plans for one-day strikes on Thursday and Sunday, the SITCPLA union said in a Twitter post. 
""We have suspended the strike on Jan 8, 2019, in order to continue negotiations,"" the two unions said in a statement. 
Ryanair suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, forcing it to cancel hundreds of flights, after the airline recognized unions for the first time in 2017.
But it got through Christmas without any industrial action. 
According to the strike plans agreed with the Spanish labor authorities, cabin crew union members would operate all flights between Spanish islands and 50 percent of flights between Spanish islands and the Spanish mainland on the strike days. 
But they will only operate 25 percent of flights to and from Spain over 500 km.
Ryanair last week said it did not expect customers would be disrupted by the action but a spokesman for the SITCPLA union said he did not think disruption to flights could be avoided if cabin crew go through with their strike action.

(This story has been refiled to correct to show unions to meet Ryanair on Tuesday (not Wednesday), paragraph two.)

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 05:52AM ET</span>",India's top court backs Monsanto on GM cotton payments,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that U.S. seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) can claim patents on its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds in the world's biggest producer of the fiber.
The decision on appeal overturns an earlier ruling by the Delhi High Court that Monsanto - which has been bought by German drug and crop chemical maker  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) - was unable to claim patents on GM cotton seeds.
The outcome is positive for foreign agricultural companies such as Monsanto, Bayer, Dupont Pioneer and Syngenta which have been concerned that they could lose patents on GM crops in India.
""This is a very good move as most international companies have stopped releasing new technology in the Indian market due to the uncertainty over patent rule,"" said Ajit Narde, a leader of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a farmers' body, which has been demanding access to new technologies.
Access to advanced technology was important to help Indian farmers to compete with rivals overseas, Narde said.
Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Monsanto and India's Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co (Mahyco), sells GM cotton seeds under license to more than 40 Indian seed companies, which in turn sell product to retailers. 
The Delhi High Court ruling came after local company Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL) argued that India's Patent Act does not allow Monsanto any patent cover for its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds.
Monsanto's Indian joint venture had terminated its contract with NSL in 2015 after a royalty payment dispute, escalating tensions over seed technology and drawing in the Indian and U.S. governments. 
The Supreme Court on Tuesday also said the Delhi High Court would examine Monsanto's claims that NSL infringed its intellectual property on Bt cotton seeds.
New Delhi in 2003 approved Monsanto's GM cotton seed trait, the only lab-altered crop allowed in India, as well as an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.

Monsanto's GM cotton seed technology dominates 90 percent of India's cotton acreage.

1666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",Canadian Crude Surges as Rail Shipments Rise Despite Supply Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Heavy Canadian crude surged to the strongest level in more than a year as rail shipments keep rising even as production was curtailed.
The discount of Western Canadian Select at Hardisty, Alberta, to West Texas Intermediate futures shrank $2.10 to $10.50 a barrel Monday, the narrowest since August 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s from about $29 a barrel at the end of November, just before Alberta announced that producers would have to reduce output by 325,000 barrels a day in January to alleviate a glut caused by surging oil sands supply running into limited pipeline space.
The current discount is too narrow to cover the cost of transporting oil by rail to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast and wouldn’t even cover some shipments by pipeline. But train deliveries continued to creep upwards last month after oil companies signed long-term contracts earlier in the year, said Mike Walls, an analyst at Genscape Inc., which monitors Western Canadian terminals that account for about 70 percent of the region’s crude-by-rail shipments.
“We have seen continued ramping of rail through end of year 2018 and expect it to continue to rise gradually even with the production cuts,” he said in an email. “Rail is still needed to clear the market and help drain inventories to the desired level.”
About 281,000 barrels a day where shipped by rail the week of Dec. 28, up from a November average of about 263,000, Walls said. “These rail contracts are long-term term contracts and they are take or pay.”
Cenovus Energy Inc. announced in September that it would ship 100,000 barrels of crude a day by the middle of this year after signing three-year agreements with Canadian rail companies.
“What I am seeing is substantial increase in rail car loadings,” Tim Pickering, chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary.“I don’t believe the cuts are too deep. Rather, I think the demand for deeply-discounted Canadian crude is substantial.”

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics says weak chip demand sent fourth-quarter profit well below market estimates,"By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to ""ease confusion"" among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown.
The South Korean firm also said profit would remain subdued in the first quarter due to difficult conditions in memory chips, but that the market is likely to improve in the second half of the year as customers release new smartphones.
Weaker earnings at the world's biggest maker of smartphones and semiconductors adds to worries for investors already on edge after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) last week took the rare move of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, citing poor iPhone sales in China.
China boasts the world's biggest smartphone market, but a slowing economy, exacerbated by a trade war with the United States, has seen demand for gadgets drop across the tech sector. Growing support for domestic champions has also impacted foreign brands, with Samsung's market share falling to 0.9 percent from a high of 18.2 percent in 2013.
Still, the South Korean firm's chips power the handsets of most major makers, including Apple and China's market leader Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Its memory and processor chips account for over three-quarters of overall profit and about 38 percent of sales.
For October-December, Samsung estimated operating profit of 10.8 trillion won ($9.67 billion), missing the 13.2 trillion won average of 26 analyst estimates in an I/B/E/S Refinitiv poll. It also estimated an 11 percent fall in revenue at 59 trillion won.
Samsung routinely releases estimated earnings figures before posting detailed results and elaboration toward the end of the month. For the just-ended quarter, however, it issued its first commentary since late 2014, when mobile phone profit dropped.
It said weaker-than-expected demand from data center customers adjusting inventories drove down chip prices and hurt earnings in the face of rising macro uncertainty. It did not disclose the customers or elaborate on the macro uncertainty.
Data center demand - mostly from the United States - currently accounts for as much as nearly 30 percent of demand for Samsung's DRAM chips compared with 5 percent five years ago, said analyst Kim Yang-jae at KTB Investment & Securities.
""Smaller investment from data centers, a really bad smartphone market in China, and impact from the U.S.-China trade war have all hit Samsung's chip business,"" Kim said.
On the whole, analysts expect Samsung's profit to decline through 2019, with a slowing Chinese economy eroding demand.
""Second- and third-tier Chinese smartphone makers saw drastic drops in their sales, which also took a toll on chip demand,"" said analyst Kim Young-woo analyst at SK Securities.
CHIP PRICES
Prices for DRAM chips, which provide devices with temporary workspaces and allow them to multi-task, fell 10 percent in the fourth quarter, showed data from industry tracker DRAMeXchange. Prices of NAND flash memory chips, which hold data permanently, slipped 15 percent.
DRAMeXchange expects memory chip prices to fall 10 percent on an average in the first quarter of 2019.
Samsung also said a ""stagnant and fiercely competitive smartphone market"" pressured income and that the firm would continue to innovate its product line such as with foldable handsets and models capable of fifth-generation (5G) networking.
""If Apple's not selling, then is it Samsung that's selling well? It is not. The smartphone market is already saturated,"" said senior analyst Greg Roh at Hyundai Motor Securities.
""Apple's iPhones have not been selling well in China... That's even worse for Samsung because that would drag its chip prices down,"" Roh said, referring to Apple as a Samsung chip client.
Later on Tuesday, domestic peer LG Electronics Inc also flagged a drop in quarterly profit, with analysts pointing to increased marketing spending on smartphones as well as worse-than-expected sales of home appliances such as refrigerators in regions including China.
Shares of LG closed down 3.6 percent whereas those of Samsung closed down 1.7 percent. The benchmark Kospi index ended down 0.6 percent.
Last year, Samsung shares lost 24 percent and LG fell 41 percent amid a global tech selloff prompted by investor fears over the impact on supply chains of the Sino-U.S. trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen 16 percent since setting a record high on Aug. 30.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's HNA touts assets for sale as funding crunch intensifies,"By Yilei Sun and Adam Jourdan
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's indebted HNA Group met bankers on Tuesday to tout the latest assets that the sprawling conglomerate is putting on the block as it looks to raise funds and stave off an intensifying cash crunch.
The range of assets, spanning a hotel project in frozen Harbin and stakes in struggling online lender Dianrong, insurer Bohai Life and brokerage HNA Futures, underscores how the group is shedding almost all non-core businesses as it pares back an empire that once spread from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.
The finance-to-aviation group [HNAIRC.UL] has been ramping up asset sales over the past year. However the possible sale of many on the list of at least 20 assets presented to bankers and seen by Reuters has not been previously reported.
HNA did not respond to requests for comment.
The embattled group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the company stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets.
But faced with soaring debt and increased government scrutiny of aggressive deal-making, HNA has pushed ahead with asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotels groups, and discussions on key overseas units such as Ingram Micro and its luxury $300 million-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"".
Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] was leading a team to supervise asset disposals as the group looks to scale back operations to just core assets.
The document from the meeting at a Beijing hotel on Tuesday indicated HNA was looking to sell eight hotel and other property projects, including a luxury Renaissance hotel in Shanghai and a commercial complex in the western city of Chengdu.
Also on the list was a section including eight financial projects and a separate section with four stakes in leasing, insurance and banking firms.
Those stakes included 20 percent of Bohai Life, 6.18 percent of peer-to-peer lender Dianrong and more than 40 percent of financial services firm Sino Guarantee. The entirety of wholly owned brokerage unit HNA Futures was also up for sale.
Bohai, Dianrong and Sino Guarantee did not respond to requests for comment.
The document, shared by a person with direct knowledge of the matter, listed the assets with boxes for potential investors to tick to indicate which ones they might be interested in - a relatively unorthodox fund raising process.
When Reuters visited the hotel on Tuesday the investor meeting had finished, but two further people at the hotel confirmed it had taken place, asking not be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
In October last year, Reuters reported, citing documents, that HNA had put up for sale property assets worth at least $11 billion. The documents listed more than 80 assets that HNA has either put up for sale or intends to sell.

A few of those properties also appeared on HNA's list on Tuesday, which did not detail the value of any assets.

With traders awaiting fresh cues on U.S.-China trade negotiations and an address by U.S. President Donald Trump amid the federal-government funding impasse, futures on the S&P 500 Index showed muted gains Tuesday. Japan closed higher, though stocks slid in Korea and were little changed in Hong Kong. Treasuries were flat, while oil traded below $49 a barrel in New York. European stock futures advanced.
China’s benchmark repurchase rate fell to its lowest level since July 2016, as interbank liquidity became more abundant after last week’s move by the central bank to cut lenders’ required reserves. The softer dollar in recent days, care of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s signal of patience with regard to further monetary tightening, has helped limit pressure on China’s yuan even as Chinese rates drop. The yuan slipped Tuesday offshore, though remained in its recent trading range.Meantime, the outcome of U.S.-China trade negotiations hangs in the balance. American lawmakers are still unable to reach agreement on a budget, leaving parts of the federal government shut down for a third week. Trump gives a televised address Tuesday evening.
“Investors are happy to go with the positive trend in the current environment but remain wary of sharp downside reactions given the moves we’ve seen over the last few weeks and months,” Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia, wrote in a note. “Traders are still very much aware that the various geopolitical factors that have been so prevalent in influencing market moves over the last 12 months are still relevant.”

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 09:35PM ET</span>",Latest trial in J&J talc litigations gets under way in California,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A California jury on Monday heard opening statements in the latest trial over allegations that Johnson & Johnson's talc-based products, including the company's baby powder, were contaminated with asbestos and cause cancer.
The lawsuit brought by Terry Leavitt in Alameda Superior Court in Oakland is the first of over a dozen J&J (NYSE:JNJ) talc cases scheduled for trial in 2019. The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products.
Leavitt's lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. ""The evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,"" he said.
A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA, told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavitt's disease was not caused by its product.
A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday.
""Our talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,"" the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday.
J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free.
Leavitt's is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the company's raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s.
The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&J's liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value.
While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs' lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure.
Leavitt's case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&J's cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal.
In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal.
Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017.
She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources.
J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. 
Geologically, some asbestos can occur as ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.
The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Activist Starboard seeks Dollar Tree board changes, disposal","By Harry Brumpton and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP on Monday called on  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) to sell its underperforming Family Dollar business and proposed replacing a majority of the board after revealing a stake in the U.S. discount retailer.
Starboard is seeking to capitalize on criticism from some investors and analysts that Dollar Tree should consider raising prices for some products to more than $1, especially in light of the United States' trade row with China that threatens to erode its profitability.
Starboard said on Monday it had built a 1.7 percent stake in Dollar Tree, making it the ninth biggest shareholder. It said that Family Dollar was now worth far less than the $8.5 billion the discount store operator paid for it in 2015.
""We believe Dollar Tree should explore all strategic alternatives for Family Dollar, including a sale of the business,"" Starboard Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Smith said in a letter to the company. 
""The market is likely only ascribing approximately $1 billion - $3 billion of value to Family Dollar based on the current stock price,"" Smith said.
In a statement, Dollar Tree said its board had ""the right balance"" and did not comment on the fund's call for a change in pricing strategy or a sale of Family Dollar, which accounts for more than half of the retailer's 14,000 U.S. stores.
Starboard did not engage with Dollar Tree's management before nominating board directors and issuing its statement, according to two sources close to the company.
Dollar Tree sees little benefit in selling Family Dollar because of antitrust restrictions on possible buyers and the poor state of financing for retail deals, the sources said.
It also has no plans to adopt a multi-price strategy, even if this has worked for other retailers, according to the sources.
Starboard did not respond to requests for comment.
""We are in agreement with Starboard that the customers' value proposition has eroded, and that a broad market test of a multi-price approach be trialed to evaluate potential sales and margin benefits,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. 
Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar's roughly 8,000 stores four years ago was aimed at fending off growing competition from Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and rival discounter  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG). 
Despite remodeling and sprucing up some stores and expanding its product range, same-store sales growth at Family Dollar has been flat on average for the past two years. That has contributed to a 15 percent fall in Dollar Tree's shares over the past year - while rival Dollar General's stock has risen 14 percent.
""I personally think they should consider selling Family Dollar,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh. Dollar Tree-branded stores drive the vast majority of profitability and the business would be worth a higher multiple alone, Parikh said.
Starboard is one of the industry's most closely watched activist investors and industry data show that the fund tends to be more successful than others in winning board seats. 
Its intervention is Dollar Tree's second tryst with shareholder activism, after billionaire investor Carl Icahn engineered the sale of Family Dollar to it in 2015. 
At the time, Icahn was the largest shareholder in Family Dollar, exiting his stake just after the deal was formally signed.
Starboard proposed replacing seven of the retailer's 12-member board and urged the company to move away from its strict $1 ceiling for Dollar Tree-branded stores. 
""The value that Dollar Tree has offered its customers has deteriorated because of the need to fit everything into a $1 price point. Products today are smaller or of lower quality than they were five, ten, and certainly thirty years ago,"" Smith said. 
Starboard said that if the company accepts its demands, Dollar Tree could be valued at $150 per share. Dollar Tree shares closed up 5.5 percent at $97.96, giving the company a market capitalization of about $23 billion.

1686,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Nell's Trader Notebook- Crude Climbs. Gold's Year. Bitcoin as Tech,"Considering the absolute about face the Crude market has done this year, we have to opine just a little bit here. We have heard all sorts of production excuses, OPEC arguments as to why Crude basically fell out of bed, writes Nell Sloane.
Yet we aren’t sure what is the true reason. Could it be that the energy markets are also discounting a global slowdown? This certainly makes sense and so too does the fact that the United States is now the leading producer of oil.
In fact, the United States produces nearly 30% more than Saudi Arabia, can you believe it? Did you even know that? The Energy Information Administration states that the U.S. produces 15.6 million barrels a day compared to 12.1 million for SA. (EIA.gov)
Considering this fact and considering this trend is going to continue, perhaps that is more of reason why Crude (in this next chart) showing the February futures contract has declined from a high of $76.52 down to its recent low of $42.32 a loss of nearly 45%.
Just to put this into perspective, Crude oil was up 35% for the year and is now down 22%, what an absolute whipsaw! If we stick with our global slow down theme, we should see Crude trade around the $50 level for 2019 most likely capped by that 2018 high of $76.
Under $40 and we start to see some other dynamics at play, most notably leveraged producers and their debt piles being once again called into question. So not that we expect a prolonged protraction, but when leverage gets tossed into the mix, fire sales can drive prices certainly below fundamentals:
We feel that 2019 will be a great year for the metals market. Gold continues to shine and looks to be in a clear uptrend since the August lows.
All this amongst a hiking Fed which has also seen the U.S. dollar (USD) maintain its strength. The year 2018 has basically been one big down move in the complex, but the last few months it seems the complex has carved out a nice base and continues to rise.
In our most recent note, we highlighted the fact that Gold has been moving higher relative to Silver and recently hit the high of the year in this spread. Noting the double top and prior resistance, Silver has regained some footing vs. Gold as depicted in this chart:
Cryptos: In what seems to be a bizarre and overwhelming contrast in respect to Cryptocurrencies this year from last, we can’t help but comment on the digital asset sector.
As 2017 came to a close, it was all euphoria in the space and then the floor just absolutely fell out from under it.
The speculators who drove the pricing to exponential heights were taken out feet first with damage so swift and severe many would never recover.
Yet we are still bullish on blockchain and its decentralized nature. Innovation in the space will continue and the future will most definitely incorporate blockchain in it one way or another.
As far as treating these assets like financial assets, we can’t help but admit our disdain for such folly.
Cryptocurrencies never will be financial assets to be swapped for fiat, that is simply a Wall Street incarnation. Rather they are designed as a function of a particular decentralized payment or information system.
The titan of these technologies, continues to be bitcoin (BTC-USD) Even after all the damage in 2018 it currently trades at $3600.
Many will say it is finished, it’s worthless, it is down 82% off its highs.
If you take that perspective then yes, we can see the doom. Instead, how about we take a different perspective and say, it’s been around for a decade now, it trades at 3600x the U.S. dollar and it’s up 21% from September 2017.
What people fail to realize is that bitcoin is not an asset in a financial sense to be swapped for fiat. It is a technology whereby the required cost of usage is bitcoin itself.
Now we know the SEC has failed to pass any true merit tests in regard to bitcoin ETFs, but they do so at the request of undoubtedly the Federal Reserve itself.
You see dear reader, bitcoin is a competitor to fiat money, plain and simple and it is in that fact alone that all necessary measures will be taken to insure it never becomes mainstream.
Whether or not the powers that be succeed is still in question. But for now, we suspect that blockchain will continue to advance and that bitcoin will continue to be the preeminent asset among its digital peers.
So that is our take on it. We are bullish the technology and our only real opinion is that you treat it as a technology and understand that the future albeit uncertain will most certainly have a use for it somewhere. Treat it as a technology never to be converted to fiat, end of story.
That covers most of what we expect from our financial market perspectives. The other things we are keeping an eye out for in 2019 are more scientific in nature. Some of the key words you should be aware of are, grand solar minimum, cosmic rays and plasma physics.
Expect climate change to be placed at the forefront, not because we can actually do anything about it, but because the natural cyclicality of our climate is about to make a drastic change.
They want people to be aware of these changes and they will most likely have a great effect on the volatility of our weather and stress on our food supplies and power grids as well. Humans often neglect out of sheer hubris that giant ball of hydrogen plasma in the sky, it has the final say in our temperature, as for humans, well, the great George Carlin said it best:
“We’re so self-important. So self-important. Everybody’s going to save something now. Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save those snails. And the greatest arrogance of all: save the planet. What? Are these effing people kidding me? Save the planet, we don’t even know how to take care of ourselves yet. We haven’t learned how to care for one another, we’re gonna save the effing planet?” --George Carlin
Be on the lookout for increased volcanic activity, all of this is related in some way, so we want you to be aware of it. You have been sold that the Earth is warming, but like markets, the Earth has cycles as well, periods of warming and periods of cooling. Our job is to pique your interest in things we believe matter, and these things matter!
We hope you have a very safe and joyful New Year, cheers!

It pressed higher on FAANGs, Crude. Intraweek traders have not had a pullback to enter as of yet, writes Gene Inger Monday. And, some CES tech previews. He’s presenting at MoneyShow Orlando.
“You don’t go from Wild Turkey to Cold Turkey” very quickly. That’s an old quote of Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), who passed away last week. Former Dallas Fed head Dick Fisher mentioned that quote Friday.
He was reflecting on Fed monetary policy and former Dallas Fed President Kelleher (the Southwest chairman was also at that post during the epic debacle we had projected in 2007- 08). And he was also a fan of Wild Turkey Kentucky Bourbon. (I thought he preferred Maker’s Mark , but maybe not.) 
Reuters: Wall Street (SPX) extends rally Monday to second day, 10 of 11 sectors rise on trade optimism.


Of course, Dick Fisher was sharing the metaphor as it relates to weening-off a form of addiction, as he lamented Mr. Kelleher’s explanation years ago as to why Chairman Bernanke’s Fed (on which Fisher served) failed to lighten-up on super-easy emergency monetary stimulus after the crisis ebbed.
To me this comment, and earlier Friday Jim Grant (who is a bond guy) about the commercialization of ultra-low-cost money, confirm my assertion that no problem exists with regard to how Jerome Powell chairs the Fed. Rather the issue was how Bernanke overstayed the emergency low rates and QE.
Earlier Friday, I suspected Powell would talk nice but not at all change actual policy thinking at Friday’s panel discussion. So, I found the opinion Dick Fisher shared to be very important. It was that other than one or two palliative words, he saw no change or movement at all in Fed monetary policy.


So, we have Dick Fisher and Jim Grant in the bond arena so again it meant something to me, as I was drawing common sense outlooks as regard rolling-off the tremendous amount of Fed balance sheet paper of course now. And presumably expanding this year if they can’t roll it off.
Now you have these gentlemen saying I’ve got this right about the heart of issues surrounding rates. That being that it’s a supply issue primarily and not very much related to anything inflationary or to domestic economic strength.


And, of course the Jobs number ignited the Friday response initially, with far stronger-than-consensus numbers. Although that doesn’t automatically mean the economy’s cooking again (and that data was a bit stale from Dec. 12). Of course, we’re pleased to see more people working or even emerging from the shadows of the disengaged workforce that’s out there.


Now previously the market tried to link Fed Quantitative Tightening to some misjudgment about that economic vibrancy. So, there we concurred that Powell could have had a different tone (it was just off-the-cuff) at the FOMC news conference. He clarified that in talks. and again Friday. That’s context they are all debating.
There was not a single word that suggests divergence from the Fed’s approach (and needs given supply concerns) or the market continuing to relate this more to short-term rates or the economy (the chair sort of has to do that because of his mandate which isn’t as global as what’s become the modern Treasury market. which he has to take into account).


In-sum: now we await the new trade talks with China. And presuming the outcome is fine-tuned enough to revive growth expectations (there and here by the way) you could extend this overall move.
Reuters: US, China can reach trade deal ""we can live with,"" says Commerce secretary Monday.
It’s not a flawless technical pattern, given the denial of a full secondary test of the prior low due to Jobs news and overly euphoric interpretation of Chairman Powell’s remarks.
Wild Turkey to Cold Turkey reflects simply not being hawkish or dovish but rather knowing what has to be done, having a gradual withdrawal from inebriation. That was my 2015-16 taking the punch-bowl away viewpoint of a market that was struggling then, as Wall Street seemed so distraught free money was basically going away.

SPX closed Friday at 2532, up 84, writes Dr. Kerry Given Saturday. He's presenting at TradersExpo New York.
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)

The major market indices rallied strongly the day after Christmas and gave traders hope. Technical analysts often look for what they call a follow through day after a correction low is recorded. This follow through day is considered the signal that traders may once again enter the market with some confidence that the correction is past.
One begins counting days after the strong bullish move following the correction low (December 26). The day count continues as long as the low price of day one isn’t broken. On day four or later, the analyst watches for a strong bullish trading day with volume equal or higher than the previous day. When that is achieved, the follow through day has occurred. Friday was day seven and the market’s strong push higher satisfied the criteria for the follow through day.
Trading volume in the S&P 500 has run below the 50-day moving average (dma) throughout the holidays. Thursday and Friday’s trading volume finally reached back up to the 50 dma.
SPX ran consistently along the lower edge of the Bollinger bands from December 17 through the 23. Trading over the past seven sessions has pushed SPX back to the 20 dma in the center of the Bollinger bands.
Statistically speaking, we might expect SPX to trade in either direction on Monday. It would not be surprising to see some selling take place after the strong performance since December 26.

lost 23% from early October to the low on December 24. I am a little surprised that NASDAQ’s correction wasn’t the largest of any of the broad market indices given the damage incurred by many of the high-tech names in the NASDAQ.
Russell has led this correction from the beginning, trading lower and more consistently lower week after week.
Price trends since December 24 have been reassuring and the achievement of the follow through day this week probably contributed to Investors Business Daily changing their market assessment on Friday from “Market in Correction” to “Market in Confirmed Uptrend.”
I have never understood this correction from day one since it seemed to have no basis in solid economic terms. Yes, prices are higher, but companies have not grown earnings this rapidly in many years. Likewise, we have not seen GDP growth in the 3.5% range in decades.
I believe this correction was largely self-inflicted. The financial news has been infected with the rancor of the front-page news. I am amazed at how often I have heard and read the term “recession” over the past several months.
In my first economics course as an undergraduate, I learned that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. That definition hasn't changed, and we are posting GDP growth numbers in excess of three percent. Recent GDP growth rates are light years from going negative.
Businesses are complaining that they can’t hire people fast enough. Wage growth is at historic highs, while unemployment is at historic lows. Talk of recession makes no economic sense.
Why have we turned into a crowd of Chicken Littles?
I am encouraged by the recent market trends but remain concerned about the elevated levels of volatility. I may begin to enter some trades this week, but I remain cautious. This market is going to have to show me that it has gotten over its “sky is falling” fears.

1689,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Strong Emini Rally Testing February and October Lows,"The Emini reversed up strongly over the past 2 weeks. On December 24, I said that there would probably be a rally that would be strong enough to make traders wonder if the bull trend has resumed, says Dr. Al Brooks. He's presenting at MoneyShow Orlando Feb. 8.
The rally probably will go higher, but it is still likely just a strong bull leg in what will become a trading range.
The crude oil daily chart has a weak bear rally. However, the downside is minimal because the bears are exhausted. The chart will probably be in a trading range for at least a couple months.
The 30-year bond futures chart has a parabolic wedge buy climax. There will probably be at least a couple legs sideways to down over the next 2 weeks.
Crude oil Futures market:
20 Gap Bar sell signal after weak Final Bear Flag rally
The crude oil futures daily chart is in a strong bear trend. The 2-week rally has been weak. This is the first pullback to the 20-day EMA, which means it is a 20 Gap Bar sell setup. The bulls need a big bull bar to indicate that the bears have given up. The bears are still in control, despite the possible Final Bear Flag.
The crude oil futures daily chart has a 20 Gap Bar sell setup. But, the bears want a bear bar closing near is low for a sell signal bar. Without that, the bear rally will continue.
If the bulls get a big bull bar closing near its high and far above the EMA, it would indicate that the bears have given up. It would likely lead to at least 2 legs up to around the top of the early December tight trading range. That trading range is late in a bear trend. It therefore is a good candidate for a Final Bear Flag reversal.
Minor reversal and trading range likely
Even if the bulls get their reversal, the 3 month bear channel has been tight. Consequently, the 1st reversal up will be minor. This means that it will lead to a trading range and not a bull trend.
If the 20 Gap Bar sell signal triggers, the target is a test of the low. Since the bear trend has lost momentum, there will probably be buyers below the December low. A reversal up at that point would create a wedge bottom with the November and December lows.
Despite the strong bear trend, this selloff is climactic. As a result, there is probably not much downside risk over the next couple of months. A trading range is likely to form because the bears are exhausted and less willing to sell at this low price.
US 30-year Bond futures candlestick chart:
Parabolic wedge buy climax
Friday was an outside down bar that closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar for a reversal down from a parabolic wedge buy climax.
The U.S. 30-year Treasury Bond future chart has rallied strongly for 2 months in a tight bull channel. Because the channel has 3 legs, it is a parabolic wedge buy climax. A trend like this is unsustainable.
The stop for the bulls is too far below. They therefore are risking more open profit than they typically do. As a result, they will take profits.
When they take profits, they will not look to buy again just 2 – 3 days later. A reasonable minimum goal is TBTL (ten bars, two legs) down to the 20-day EMA. Also, the reversal usually reaches either of the 2 higher lows. Then, the chart evolves into a trading range for the next 20 or so bars.
Outside down sell signal bar
Friday’s outside down candlestick is a sell signal bar. It represents bulls giving up. Bears will sell on a stop below its low. Their protective stop is above Friday’s high. If they get stopped out, they will sell the next reversal down as well if it comes within a few bars after the new high.
The odds are that the daily chart will trade sideways to down for at least a couple weeks. However, the tight bull channel means that the bulls are strong. Therefore, the selloff will probably be a minor reversal. This means it will lead to a trading range, not a bear trend.
Monthly S&P 500 Emini futures candlestick chart:
Bull inside bar after December sell climax
The monthly S&P 500 Emini futures candlestick chart has a small inside bar so far in January. Last month bounced from the 8-year bull trend line and a 20% correction.
The monthly S&P 500 Emini futures candlestick chart has traded in a narrow range so far in January. Last month bounced from both a 20% correction and an 8-year bull trend line. However, December had the biggest bear body in the 10-year bull trend. In addition, it closed below the 2018 trading range. Finally, it was the third bar in a big, fast correction down from the all-time high. The momentum down is strong enough to make lower prices likely.
Whenever there is a breakout, the next month is important. January is the follow-through bar. It can help predict what traders can expect over the following months.
Bear case: strong January selling, confirmed bear breakout
If the candlestick in January is a big bear trend bar closing on its low, that would signify strong follow-through selling. The bears currently have a 30% chance of this outcome. It would make lower prices likely. The Emini would probably then fall to the next support level, which is the 2,100 top of the 2014 – 2015 trading range.
That trading range is a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag. If the Emini reaches its top, it will probably continue to its bottom at around 1,800. That would be about a 40% correction.
Bull case: strong January rally, failed bear breakout
The bulls want January to form a big bull trend bar closing on its high. If they succeed, January would become a buy signal bar for February. Traders would suspect that the December bear breakout failed.
They would then look for a strong rally in February. If that were to happen, then December would likely be the end of the selloff. Traders would expect a new all-time high within a few months. There is a 20% chance of this at the moment.
Neutral case: Neutral January, need more information
Finally, if January is unclear, traders would expect more sideways trading in February. For example, if January remains inside of December’s range and the candlestick has a small body with prominent tails, traders will need more information. This is the most common situation after a breakout.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (N:LLY) said on Monday it will buy Loxo Oncology Inc (O:LOXO) for $8 billion, an expensive bet on a pipeline of cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations and the biggest acquisition in the drugmaker's 143-year history. The price represents a 68 percent premium to Loxo's Friday share price close, which some Wall Street analysts said was high for a company with only one drug on the market that it shares with a partner.
Loxo shares surged 66 percent to $232.65, close to the offer price of $235 per share, and prompted stock price rises for a other small developers of targeted cancer therapies, including Array BioPharma (O:ARRY),  Blueprint Medicines Corp  (O:BPMC) and  Clovis Oncology  Inc (O:CLVS). Lilly shares rose 0.5 percent to $115.28. 
The cash deal comes on the heels of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N:BMY) agreement last week to buy  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) for $74 billion in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, spurring investors' hopes of a new wave of large healthcare acquisitions. 
Loxo gained prominence in 2017 - just three years after going public - with impressive clinical trial results showing its drug to be highly effective on cancers driven by a single gene mutation known as TRK fusion, regardless of where in the body the tumors originated.
These patients, with more than 17 different types of advanced cancer but all with the same genetic mutation, had run out of other treatment options. Yet some 80 percent who received Loxo's first drug, a pill called larotrectinib, experienced dramatic, often long-term improvement. 
The Connecticut-based company won U.S. approval in November for the treatment under the brand name Vitrakvi, which is sold in partnership with  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn). Lilly said it ""very much"" wants to continue the agreement with Bayer, which sells Vitrakvi outside the United States and shares U.S. commercial costs and profits with Loxo.
Loxo is also developing LOXO-292 targeting a different rare gene mutation, and analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of over $1 billion. Lilly would gain full control of that drug as it is not part of Loxo's Bayer collaboration. 
In an interview, Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said that drug targeting a mutation known as RET, seen in thyroid, lung and other cancers, was a major driver of the deal. It received breakthrough therapy designation from U.S. regulators, which could speed its path to approval.
Loxo was quick to take advantage of new technologies that can isolate genetic drivers of tumor growth, and the willingness of regulators to approve treatments across tumor types when a specific defect is present, Ricks said at the annual JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday.
""Loxo sort of predicted that and then capitalized on that in a way that created value,"" Ricks said, adding that the acquisition will help Lilly identify new targetable mutations. He said Lilly was also interested in expanding in immuno-oncology through its own research and possible deals.
FINDING THE PATIENT
Targeted therapies offer the promise of potentially dramatic results if patients most likely to benefit are correctly identified, and are seen as a potential alternative to chemotherapy and its many adverse side effects.
""The acquisition of Loxo, along with last week's acquisition of Celgene, may represent the cream of the crop in biotech being harvested by big pharma,"" IFS Securities analyst David Bouchey said. ""The size of the deal may indicate Lilly's willingness to pay up to out-bid the competition.""
BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the $8 billion valuation seemed high as Wall Street does not expect Loxo revenue to reach $1 billion until 2023.
Loxo's drugs present the particular challenge of finding advanced cancer patients with the rare genetic mutations, which will require significantly increased use of advanced sequencing of tumors. The TRK mutation targeted by Vitrakvi only occurs in about 1 percent of patients with solid tumor cancers.
That effort got a boost last year, when the U.S. government said its Medicare program will cover so-called next generation sequencing, which looks for hundreds of mutations across all solid tumors, for advanced cancer patients.
Lilly has typically eschewed large deals, preferring to develop its own drugs. But last year it paid $1.6 billion for Armo Biosciences, a developer of immunotherapy cancer drugs, and said in November it was open to more deals.
Lilly's oncology portfolio includes lung cancer chemotherapy Alimta, which had third-quarter sales of $520.5 million.
Vitrakvi, priced at $32,800 per month, and experimental follow-up drug LOXO-195, on which Bayer is also a partner, together could generate annual sales of about $750 million, according to Piper Jaffray & Co. 
Bayer said it does not expect the Lilly deal to impact its contract with Loxo for the time being.

Loxo's shares have run up nearly 65 percent over the past 12 months, and ten-fold since its IPO in 2014, while Lilly's stock has surged about 35 percent since last January.

The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets also said it has elected Wayne Hewett to join the board.
Peetz was named to the board in February of 2017 and chaired the risk committee, a key position as Wells Fargo works to prove that it has improved its risk management controls. 
The former president of Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) is stepping down to devote more time to other commitments, the statement said. She will retire as director during the company's annual shareholder meeting in April.
Enhancing its risk controls is a priority for the bank after a series of scandals stemming from its sales practices landed the bank under public and regulatory scrutiny. Revelations that Wells Fargo opened up potentially millions of unauthorized accounts has resulted in billions of fines for the bank and a punitive cap on assets from the Federal Reserve.
Hewett is currently chairman of industrial manufacturing company DiversiTech Corporation and has experience with medical devices, food and electronics, the statement said.

“Wayne brings a unique and relevant background to Wells Fargo’s business and strategic direction, further enhancing the breadth of skills and experience of our board,” said President and Chief Executive Tim Sloan.

1695,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
JOLTs Numbers Expected to Rise
The main economic data tomorrow will be the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) numbers for November.
The report will be released at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Economists forecast that job openings rose to 7.17 million.
But the numbers are from two months ago, so may not have a large impact on the markets, especially coming after last week's very strong gain in December nonfarm payrolls reported Friday.
Helen of Troy Reports Earnings
Beauty products maker Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) will release its latest quarterly numbers before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analysts predict that the company earned $2.36 per share on sales of nearly $425 million.
The stock bucked the trend of the overall market at the end of last year and is up over the last three months.
The company beat estimates and raised guidance in its last quarterly report.
Will Oil’s Rally Continue?
Oil prices have enjoyed a rally in the new year and tomorrow will bring some more data for traders to consider.
The API’s weekly crude stockpiles report will come out at 4:30 PM ET (21:30 GMT).
Stockpiles came in at 6.92 million in the previous week.
Today, U.S.-Sino trade talks, speculation over Saudi output cuts and data suggesting lower Cushing stockpiles helped oil add to 2019 gains, though the settlement off the highs also showed bulls were being cautious of overextending themselves.
U.S.  West Texas Intermediate  crude settled up 56 cents, or 1.2%, at $48.52 per barrel, after reaching a high of $49.79."
