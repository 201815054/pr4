Investing.com – The Dow closed above 35,000 for the first time ever, led by a rally to record highs in shares of Google and Facebook following strong quarterly results from Twitter and Snap.    
The S&P 500 rose 1.01% to a closing record of 4,411.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.68%, or 238 points to close at 35,061, the Nasdaq gained 1.04% to 14,836.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rallied 5% and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gained nearly 4% to notch record highs ahead of their quarterly results due next week. The bid up in social media companies comes as better-than-expected quarterly results from Twitter and Snap pointed to a strong backdrop for advertising spending.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) rallied 3% after reporting revenue growth of 74% year-over-year, its fastest growth since 2017.
“[W]e are bullish on advertising momentum heading into 2H, led by strong demand across large advertisers, evidenced by 3Q guidance being 8% above Street expectations,” Oppenheimer said as it raised its price target on Twitter to $85 from $70. 
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) jumped 24% as a ramp up in users and advertising revenue led to second-quarter results that beat analyses expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) were also in the ascendency ahead of their quarterly results due next week.  
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), however, proved a drag on the semiconductor sector after the chipmaker reported results that topped Wall Street expectations, but guidance on quarterly revenue fell short of expectations, sending its shares more than 5% lower.
“[The] bears will question the increased magnitude of the implied decline in GMs [gross margins], while also pointing to concerns around PCs, with client computing group, needing to decline through the remainder of the year to offset the forecast pickup in data center group,” Wedbush said as it lowered its target price on Intel to $50 from $53.
Financials, meanwhile, were underperforming relative to broader market as banking stocks continued to be shunned despite a rise in yields.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP), up 1%, outperformed relative to broader financials, following better-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings. 
Concerns about the outlook on the economic recovery had sent yields spiraling earlier this week, with the 10-year falling below 1.14%.
Data released Friday, showing a rise in manufacturing activity, and weaker-than-expected services activity continued to muddy the outlook.
Energy was the sole sector in the red, paced by a decline in ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), though downside was limited by steading oil prices.
Looking ahead, corporate earnings as well as monetary policy will take center stage next week. The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. 
""The Fed will not change course quickly at next week's meeting despite the high inflation rates,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. However, it is likely to push ahead with preparations and possibly present some ensuing considerations."""

Then Buy These 3 Stocks,"With billionaire activist investor Bill Ackman betting big on economic recovery despite the spread of the hyper-contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, we think it could be wise to bet on potential beneficiaries of an expanding economy, namely Lowe's (LOW), Chipotle (CMG), and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). They are among the top holdings of Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Read on.
While cyclical stocks received immense investor attention earlier this year amid the fast-paced economic recovery, the rapid spread of the hyper-contagious COVID-19 Delta variant in recent weeks has made investors anxious about the pace of economic recovery. According to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, “The Delta variant now accounts for 83% of all sequenced Covid cases in the U.S.” Nevertheless, billionaire investor Bill Ackman said earlier this week that he expects a massive economic boom despite the delta variant.
The activist investor, who owns and manages Pershing Square Capital Management L.P., is known for his success with investments in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), and  Canadian Pacific  Railway Limited (NYSE:CP), among others. Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd., the closed-ended balanced hedge fund managed by Pershing Square Capital Management, has returned 24.7% over the past nine months.
With Bill Ackman betting big on the rebound in restaurants and retail, among other sectors, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(Reuters) - Fears of increased of regulation from Beijing crushed U.S.-listed Chinese stocks on Friday following a Chinese government crackdown on private educators.
U.S. shares of TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) and New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc, which provide tutoring and test preparation services in China, each dropped more than 50% after news that the government is barring tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families that have contributed to low birth rates.
Heavyweight Chinese internet stocks also deepened a recent selloff as the move by China added to concerns about increased regulation of Chinese companies listed on Wall Street.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) both lost 4% and Didi Global tumbled 20%.
A broad crackdown on China's massive internet sector has already rattled investors. Beijing launched a data-related cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just two days after it raised $4.4 billion in a New York initial public offering. Didi has fallen over 40% from its June 30 IPO price, while Baidu has tumbled 50% from its February record high and Alibaba is down 35% since October.
""A lot of the fast-money types had recently been trying to catch a falling knife, and some of these stocks started to look OK. But today looks like a complete capitulation, where guys can’t stomach the pain of regulatory uncertainty. People have just given up,"" said Joel Kulina, a senior trader at Wedbush Securities who specializes in technology stocks. 

The policy change threatens to decimate China's $120 billion private tutoring industry and imperils the listing ambitions of numerous venture capital-backed education firms, including Alibaba-backed Zuoyebang, and online education platforms Yuanfudao and Classin, both backed by Tencent.
The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF sank about 9%, leaving it down almost 30% year-to-date.

4,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Worried About a Market Correction? Consider Investing in These 3 Defensive Stocks,"Analysts expect major benchmark indexes to retreat in the coming months, after hitting record highs in the first half of 2021, owing to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and decelerating economic growth. However, non-cyclical defensive companies Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN) are expected to continue growing even amid an economic slowdown. So, we think these stocks could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.
The stock market is currently at risk of a correction because the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant threatens the fast-paced economic recovery. According to a note from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists, “Market breadth has been deteriorating for months and, in our opinion, is just another confirmation of the mid-cycle transition. It usually concludes with a material (10-20%) index level correction.”
Decelerating economic growth and declining money supply are expected to be the major factors driving a market correction. Analysts also expect a deceleration in corporate profits this earnings season, which increases the probability of a broad market pullback. The Fed’s sooner-than-expected tapering plans have also tempered market sentiment. In this regard, Invesco analyst Kristina Hooper said, “We’re in something of a precarious period…because we’ve gone so long without any kind of significant sell-off for the stock market. In addition, we’re watching the Fed try to maneuver into a very different position…There’s always a risk when you have a market that has been driven largely by the Fed.”
Bearish market sentiment is expected to affect the booming cyclical stocks the worst as investors rotate toward defensive stocks with proven ability to withstand pullbacks. Furthermore, these companies generally operate in the production and supply of goods and services with relatively inelastic demand, ensuring stable revenue and earnings growth irrespective of decelerating economic recovery. So, because fundamentally sound defensive companies Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), CVS Health Corporation (CVS), and Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN) are expected to witness stable growth in the near term, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

So, we think it could be wise to avoid cryptocurrency-related stocks  Charles Schwab  (SCHW), Coinbase (COIN), and SoFi (SOFI), which benefit from the trading of cryptocurrencies. Read on.Cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm over the past few years despite their extreme volatility and lack of regulation. However, retail investing in cryptocurrency is expected to decline in the coming months with China’s intensifying crackdown on digital currencies on concerns over massive energy consumption in the currency mining process and illegal activities, such as money laundering, that are perpetrated using them. In May, the U.S. Treasury Department said that it would require any cryptocurrency transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the IRS.
Russia’s central bank said yesterday that stock exchanges in Russia shouldn’t list investment products related to cryptocurrency prices. And last month, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, was banned from operating in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s indication that it will raise interest rates sooner than previously anticipated could lead to further pressure on such risky assets.
Thus, irrespective of one’s views on the prospects of cryptocurrencies, we think it’s better to stay away from the shares of fundamentally weak companies that benefit from cryptocurrency trading, for example The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN), and SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI). These stocks are currently trading at valuations that are not justified by their growth prospects.

Investing.com – Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) stock fell 2.5% Friday as disappointment over the single-digit growth in revenue from its aerospace segment outweighed the second revision in guidance and overall solid growth in revenue and income.
New orders rose over 20% organically.
Full-year sales are now expected to be in the range of $34.6 billion to $35.2 billion, up from the last revised $34 billion to $34.8 billion.

Overall, second-quarter sales rose 18% to $8.80 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.02, growing 60% and topping the higher end of the $1.86 to $1.96 guidance.
The company listed a boost to buildings and infrastructure in the U.S. because of spending by federal government and upcoming capital reinvestment wave in oil and gas sector as some of the end markets driving growth.

Dividends paid by Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), McDonald’s (MCD), and  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) yield more than 2%. Furthermore, given their low beta, we think these stocks could be safer investment bets right now. Read on.The stock market is experiencing substantial volatility due to concerns over high inflation and fears regarding the global spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. According to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the seven-day average of COVID-19 cases had climbed approximately 70% in the space of a week. The highly contagious Delta variant is primarily responsible for this resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
Concerns over a potential slowdown in global economic growth drove a broad market sell-off on July 19, representing the market’s worst day in nine months. Given this backdrop, low-volatility dividend-paying stocks could be the best bet now. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is a popular way to beat market volatility and mitigate portfolio losses.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD), and Medtronic plc (MDT) are well-established companies that have been paying steady dividends for years. The dividends paid by these companies yield more than 2%. Also, each of these stocks possesses a low beta, indicating that they are less volatile than the broader market.

Most of them have been grappling with industry-wide issues, that include the slow rollout of retail chains in major Canadian provinces, competition from a thriving black market as well as overvalued acquisitions.
This in turn led to tepid demand for cannabis products, high inventory levels, widening losses, and multi-billion-dollar goodwill write-downs. Further, in order to offset cash burn, cannabis companies have raised equity capital several times, which has diluted shareholder wealth and contributed to their stock decline.
However, the marijuana market in Canada continues to expand and cannabis legalization efforts around the world makes these stocks compelling bets for long-term growth investors.

(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) is expected to overtake  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) in quarterly sales growth for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as the return of Marvel superheroes boosts toy sales and its TV and film productions come back on track.
The Monopoly board game maker, which will report second-quarter results on Monday, has high hopes for its Entertainment One unit, the studio behind ""Peppa Pig"", that returned to growth after a year of heavy COVID-19 production constraints. 
The release of ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" and ""Black Widow"" is also expected to contribute to an estimated 34.7% increase in Hasbro's second-quarter revenue through sales of toys based on the popular franchises.
Meanwhile, second-quarter sales growth at Mattel is expected to slow to 19.2% from 47.2% in the first quarter. 
""I can see Hasbro taking back some of that share it lost to Mattel, with the sales it will get with the new movies releasing this year,"" said Jackie Breyer, publisher of trade magazine ""The Toy Book"".
(Graphics: Sales Performance: Hasbro vs. Mattel: https://graphics.reuters.com/HASBRO-RESULTS/PREVIEW/egpbknmyjvq/chart.png)
THE CONTEXT 
The shutdown of TV and film production and the lack of toy sales tied to big movie releases, on which Hasbro depends more than its rival Mattel, led to a 29% drop in pro-forma revenue in the year-earlier second quarter despite higher demand for games like ""Jenga"" and ""Twister"".
Analysts expect Hasbro to provide an outlook for the holiday season as supply disruptions and price increases cause uncertainty over what consumer demand will look like during the crucial shopping period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has YouTube, not just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), on its list of social media platforms officials say are responsible for an alarming spread of misinformation about COVID vaccines and are not doing enough to stop it, sources familiar with the administration's thinking said.
The criticism comes just a week after President Joe Biden called Facebook and other social media companies ""killers"" for failing to slow the spread of misinformation about vaccines. He has since softened his tone. https://reut.rs/3kP3lD4
A senior administration official said one of the key problems is ""inconsistent enforcement."" YouTube - a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google - and Facebook get to decide what qualifies as misinformation on their platforms. But the results have left the White House unhappy. 
""Facebook and YouTube... are the judge, the jury and the executioner when it comes to what is going on in their platforms,"" an administration official said, describing their approach to COVID misinformation. ""They get to grade their own homework."" 
Some of the main pieces of vaccine misinformation the Biden administration is fighting include that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective, false claims that they carry microchips and that they hurt women's fertility, the official said. 
Social media companies have come under fire recently from Biden, his press secretary, Jen Psaki, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who have all said the spread of lies about vaccines is making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.
A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has also been highlighted by the White House, showed 12 anti-vaccine accounts are spreading nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine misinformation online. Six of those accounts are still posting on YouTube. https://www.counterhate.com/disinfosequel
""We would like to see more done by everybody"" to limit the spread of inaccurate information from those accounts, the official said. 
The fight against vaccine misinformation has become a top priority for the Biden administration at a time when the pace of vaccinations has slowed considerably despite the risk posed by the Delta variant, with people in many parts of the country hostile to being vaccinated.
The requests to Facebook and YouTube come after the White House reached out to Facebook, Twitter and Google in February about clamping down on COVID misinformation, seeking their help to stop it from going viral, another senior administration official said then.
""Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to vaccine misinformation... but Google has a lot to answer for and somehow manages to get away with it always because people forget they own YouTube,"" said Imran Ahmed, CCDH founder and chief executive.
YouTube spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said that since March 2020, the company has removed over 900,000 videos containing COVID-19 misinformation and terminated YouTube channels of people identified in the CCDH report. She said the company's policies are based on the content of the video, rather than the speaker. 
""If any remaining channels mentioned in the report violate our policies, we will take action, including permanent terminations,"" she said.
On Monday, YouTube also said it will add more credible health information and as well as tabs for viewers to click on. 
The senior administration official cited four issues on which the administration has asked Facebook to provide specific data, but the company has been reticent to comply. 
These include how much vaccine misinformation exists on its platform, who is seeing the inaccurate claims, what the company is doing to reach out to them and how does Facebook know the steps it is taking are working. 
The official said the answers Facebook has given are not ""good enough."" Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister said the company has removed over 18 million pieces of COVID-19 misinformation since the start of the pandemic and that its own data shows that for people in the United States using the platform, vaccine hesitancy has declined by 50% since January and vaccine acceptance is high.

In a separate blog post last Saturday, Facebook called on the administration to stop ""finger-pointing,"" laying out the steps it had taken to encourage users to get vaccinated. 
But the administration official said the blog post did not have any metrics of success. The Biden administration's broad concern is that the platforms are ""either lying to us and hiding the ball, or they're not taking it seriously and there isn't a deep analysis of what's going on in their platforms,"" the official said. ""That calls any solutions they have into question.""

Investing.com – Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock traded flat Friday after the paper products maker forecast a lower outlook now that the elevated consumption of pandemic times has returned to more normal levels.
The company lowered its forecast for the year, citing “significantly higher input cost inflation and lower sales volumes, partially offset by additional cost savings and reduced discretionary spending.' The stock nudged up 0.1% in early afternoon trading.
Higher costs of raw materials and less binge buying by consumers hurt the maker of Kleenex tissues in the second quarter. At-home consumption fell as the economy reopened and the need to stock up more than needed withered.
Consumption of hygiene products like tissues had jumped to record levels during the pandemic due to a combination of panic buying and consumer focus on cleanliness.
Net income fell 41% to $404 million with net sales growing a mere 2% to $4.72 billion.
Diluted earnings per share fell 40% to $1.19.
Both EPS and revenue came below the analysts’ expectation of $1.74 and $4.78 billion, respectively.
The company now sees full-year 2021 organic sales flat to 2% lower and adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.90.
The prior outlook was for organic sales growth of up to 1% and adjusted earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.55.

The stock opened at $21.70 per share compared with the initial public offering price of $20 per share.
Core & Main, which has 285 branch locations and a headcount of 3,700, has completed 12 acquisitions since becoming an independent company in August 2017. 
In a regulatory filing earlier, the company has said it would continue to pursue such deals, given the highly fragmented market it operates in.
The newly listed company is sensitive to activity in the residential and non-residential construction markets in the United States. 
Last year, demand for its products softened due to the pandemic, notably in areas where governments more narrowly defined which services constitute ""essential services"" with respect to construction activities.
The United States is now seeing a severe shortage of residential accommodation, which has boosted prices and sparked bidding wars across the country. Demand for houses is being driven by low mortgage rates and a desire for more spacious accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company provides water, wastewater, storm drainage, fire protection products and related services to municipalities, private water companies and contractors. CD&R bought the company in a $2.5 billion deal from HD Supply Holdings (NASDAQ:HDS) in 2017.
CD&R will control about 79.6% of the total voting power of Core & Main after the offering, according to the filing.
Core & Main raised nearly $698 million by selling 34.9 million shares at the lower end of its earlier price target between $20 and $23 each.
Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for the offering.

Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back-to-office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank's U.S. staff working from home will begin returning to office from Sept. 7 and the process will continue through October, Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell told employees in a memo seen by Reuters. Returns to office will be organized by job function and location.

The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase.
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
CEO Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) 
The bank's chief executive officer, James Gorman, said if most employees are not back to work at the bank's Manhattan headquarters in September, he will be ""very disappointed"".
Gorman said his bank's policy will vary by location, noting the firm's 2,000 employees in India will not return to offices this year. 
The bank's staff and clients will not be allowed to enter its New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated, according to a source familiar with the matter. Employees, clients, and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access the bank's offices in New York and Westchester, the source said.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) 
The lender expects all of its vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day in early September, and will then focus on developing plans to bring back unvaccinated workers to its sites, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told https://bloom.bg/3gyALn3 Bloomberg News in an interview.

The special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which had filed for a $250 million IPO in March, did not give a reason for the cancellation of the IPO in a regulatory filing on the move. A Barrack spokesperson declined to comment.
Barrack, who chaired Trump's inaugural fund and was a frequent guest at the White House, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with illegally lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. He denied the charges through his spokesperson.
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds in an IPO with the aim of merging with a private company, which becomes public as result. They have become a popular alternative to a traditional IPO, though investor interest has cooled in recent weeks after some of the deals ended up performing poorly.
The canceled SPAC's sponsors were Falcon Peak Partners, Barrack's family office, and TI Capital Management, a Los Angeles-based investment firm founded by Ziad Ghandour. Barrack was named as the blank-check company's chairman, while Ghandour serves was its chief executive officer.

A TI Capital Management spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Barrack founded telecommunications infrastructure-focused private equity firm Colony Capital (NYSE:DBRG) in 1991, which was rebranded as DigitalBridge Group Inc. He stepped down as DigitalBridge's chief executive in 2020 but remains a non-executive director.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd reported a 58% jump in quarterly revenue on Friday, led by a strong show at its dominant oil and gas business. 
India's most valuable company, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, benefited from a sharp increase in product prices on the back of higher crude prices. Brent prices surged 18.2% in the June quarter due to tight supplies.
""Stronger oil fundamentals, vaccination programs and better demand outlook have resulted in a steady rise in crude prices throughout the first quarter,"" the company, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, said in a statement.
Revenue surged to 1.44 trillion rupees, fueled by an over 70% jump in the oil-to-chemicals business. 
Consolidated profit, however, fell to 122.73 billion rupees ($1.65 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, from 132.33 billion rupees a year earlier, mainly hit by a rise in tax expenses. 
Jio, the company's telecom operations, added 14.3 million customers as of June end, fewer than the 15.4 million in the previous quarter.
The company has used up nearly all airwaves it won, and additional airwaves have been used to create capacity for the next 200 million customers on the network, an executive said on a post-earnings conference call.
Reliance has been diversifying from its core oil and gas business as it focuses on retail and telecoms. 
The retail network, which consists of more than 12,000 stores and supermarkets, reported a near 50% drop in footfall in the first quarter from the previous three months as the second wave of COVID-19 ravaged the country. 
""COVID-related restrictions on store operations during the quarter impacted our retail business operations and profitability,"" Chairman Ambani said in a statement.

""This is a temporary phenomenon,"" he added.

A bout of selling hit financial markets on Monday as investors grew nervous about the fast-spreading Delta variant of COVID-19 hampering a global economic recovery. 
However, strong earnings reports and the ECB's commitment keep interest rates at record lows for even longer pushed the benchmark STOXX 600 higher every day since then. 
""The Monday selloff seems like a moment of brief panic, and ... was enough, it appears, to reset sentiment and activity and prompt a resurgence of bullish momentum.

Investing.com – Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) stock tumbled more than 23% in Friday’s session as the market for hard seltzers dealt a rude surprise to the brewer, knocking off its second-quarter earnings and forcing it to lower its forecast for the ongoing financial year.
Jim Koch, chairman and founder of the company, listed several factors behind the new paradigm in the seltzer market that led to the fall in earnings. He said the market has matured. The consumption of seltzers has moved to on-premise channels and new entrants have proliferated, leading to more choices for the consumer, according to Koch.
“We increased our production of Truly to meet our summer peak and have had lower than anticipated demand for certain Truly brand styles which has resulted in higher than planned inventory levels at our breweries and increased supply chain costs and complexity,” he said.
“Our outlook for the hard seltzer category in the second half of 2021 is uncertain and we have planned our capacity and spending based upon several volume scenarios.”
Net income for the second quarter was $59.2 million, a decrease of 1.6% from the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share was $4.75, a decrease of 2.7% and lower than the $6.69 projected by analysts.
Net revenue rose by a third to $602.81 million and came below analysts’ expectation of $665.25 million.
The company incurred much higher advertising and selling expenses due to investments in brands and more media spending.  
The company now projects full year 2021 diluted EPS to be between $18 and $22, lower than the $22 to $26 range it gave in April.

24,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>",Hertz’s Quirky Stock Gives Retail Holders $5 Edge Over Insiders,"(Bloomberg) -- How long can retail day traders be right about the value of Hertz’s stock and institutions be wrong? We’re about to find out.
The latest round of drama for Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc. concerns its newly re-launched shares, which can be bought and sold by individuals on the open market for about $17. But insiders who got their stakes as part of the auto rental company’s recent bankruptcy settlement can trade only with other professionals in private markets, at least for now. Those shares are fetching about $5 less, according to investors with access to trading data.
The quirk is rooted in U.S. securities law, which lets shares skip the usual registration rules if they’re given to bondholders and other creditors to settle unpaid debts. This break, though, comes with a restriction: The unregistered shares can be held only by so-called qualified buyers, and thus can’t be dumped into the public market. In this case, that’s 97% of Hertz’s stock.
The upshot is that nearly all of Hertz’s shares can be bought and sold only among professionals. Their price for the stock, which is less than a month old, has hovered around $12, two people familiar with the private trading said. They requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to talk about the matter.
“I don’t know that it’s unfair because this is what everyone signed up for,” said Phil Brendel, a senior credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence who specializes in dissecting settlements for distressed and bankrupt companies.
Once Hertz registers the privately traded shares, the price difference should vanish, Brendel said, and they’ll probably trade closer to $12 than the current price of about $17. The company has not said when it will register those shares, but one person with knowledge of the timing said Hertz is likely to file for approval in three to six months.
Hertz, based in Estero, Florida, didn’t have a comment on the anomaly. At either price, the stock is in far better shape than it was during the depths of the pandemic and bankruptcy, when the company told shareholders they would almost certainly be wiped out. The subsequent economic rebound and relentless support from meme-stock traders restored some of the value to the stock, creating a windfall for anyone who bought at the time and a new source of value to help settle Hertz’s debts.
Brisk Trading
Hertz’s exit from bankruptcy was carefully negotiated among different groups of creditors, including noteholders and other lenders owed billions of dollars, shareholders and an investment group lead by Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management that ultimately won control of the company. The settlement included swapping the old shares for the new series of stock that’s now trading.
To get their shares, noteholders first were given cash for their debt. They then had the option of buying Hertz at $10 and giving up their demand to be compensated for the early payoff of their bonds, or rejecting the shares and filing a claim for the fee.
Only about 14 million shares are held by the general public. Qualified investors hold more than 450 million, and their trading has been brisk, with far more shares changing hands than in the public market, the people said.
In a single trade earlier this week, a seller offered 250,000 shares at a bit more than $12 each, according to a document shared with Bloomberg News. That same day, only 292,000 shares were sold on the public market.
The price professionals are paying is much more rational than the public price, Brendel said. Hertz estimated that in 2023 the company would take in about $857 million in earnings before interest expense, taxes and amortization, or Ebitda, which is a common accounting measure of performance. At $12 a share, Hertz would be valued at about $8.6 billion, or 10 times the Ebitda estimate.
“It is eminently more reasonable,” Brendel said.

The company has approximately 81,700 net acres in the liquid-rich Delaware Basin, which is in Reeves County, Tex., and Lea County, N. Mex. So far this year, the stock’s price has surged 270%, driven primarily by surging oil prices, with growing demand and reduced supply by the major oil-producing countries. CDEV’s strong foothold in the prolific, oil-producing Delaware Basin area, should position it to capitalize on the growing demand.

Which is the better buy?.When the pandemic first hit our shores and it became clear that a shutdown would be necessary, consumer financial stocks were hit hard as there was an expectation that consumer spending would decline and defaults would spike.
However, this has turned out to not be the case. The economy did better than expectations, the stimulus was massive enough to send consumer spending to new highs and savings levels as well. Household leverage ratios are at low levels which bodes well for the expansion's duration.
If the labor market keeps improving and wages continue trending higher then the sector should keep outperforming. Within the sector are a variety of options. Companies like Synchrony Financial (SYF) take on credit risk, while consumer financial stocks like Visa (V) make money from each transaction.

While its stock price has advanced 9.5% over the past month on the back of positive developments and Redditors’ interest, it has declined more than 57% since hitting its peak on July 13. So, is it wise to buy the stock now? Let’s find out.Vocal platform owner Creatd, Inc. develops digital communities and markets branded digital content. The company provides Vocal, a content distribution platform that delivers a digital publishing platform organized into niche-communities capable of hosting rich media content. Its Vocal platform provides advertisers access to target markets that most closely match their interests. (CRTD) announced on June 30 that its Vocal+ subscribers had surpassed 30,000. CRTD is based in Fort Lee, N.J.
The company also completed the acquisition of a controlling stake of WHE Agency on July 20. While these developments, in part, helped the stock surge 9.5% over the past month, the stock hit its $7.80 intraday high on July 13, driven by a short-squeeze caused by Redditors’ interest in it. However, the stock has declined 57.2% since hitting its recent high and 30% over the past six months to close yesterday’s trading session at $3.34. 
CRTD is now phasing out duplicate outsourced consulting support and completing its permanent internal infrastructure. The company has not been able to generate any profit in the past 12 months. Furthermore, its average monthly cash burn during the first quarter (ended March 31, 2021) was roughly $1.80 million, representing an increase of approximately $1.30 million over its year-ago average monthly cash burn.

Both companies beat expectations by a significant margin due to strong in-person and digital sales. Patrick Ryan breaks down which is the better buy.Department store stocks have been quite strong as they are benefitting from the economy's reopening as foot traffic to stores has been rebounding strongly. Additionally, many of them were able to grow e-commerce sales and this part of their business is also in growth mode.
Before the pandemic, department store stocks were struggling. However, in the aftermath of the pandemic, it's possible that conditions have improved and the boom in digital and in-person sales will continue.
Below, we provide a look at two of the most intriguing department store stocks in Macy’s (M) and Dillard’s (DDS).
M is proactively attempting to adapt to the ever-changing retail ecosystem. M has implemented several key changes including a mobile-first strategy, a loyalty program, store pickup, and additional features to win new business both online and offline. After all, the enthusiasm for in-person shopping at conventional retail stores will eventually wane, shifting the spotlight back to web-based sales.
M has a forward P/E ratio of 7.83. This is one of the lower P/E ratios you will find, indicating the stock is likely underpriced at $17.42 per share. If M pops this summer or fall, it has the potential to break through its 52-week high of $22.30. M has a beta of 2.08 so it will prove somewhat volatile if the market soars or plummets.

Increasing hedging activity in the options market against a significant market decline, and a fall in Treasury yields, indicate that investors are fearful. So, amid an expected market downturn, we think it could be wise to bet on low-volatility ETFs, specifically iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor (USMV), Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), and  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) Low Volatility High Dividend (LVHD). Let’s discuss.
U.S. stocks declined sharply on the first trading day of this week on concerns over rising COVID-19 cases worldwide caused primarily by the Delta variant of COVID-19. While the broader market has since recovered, slowing economic growth could sustain market bearishness in the near term.
On July 19, the 10-year Treasury yield saw its biggest one-day drop since March 23, 2020, reflecting concerns over global economic growth. Furthermore, according to a Reuters article, in recent weeks hedges against a big market drop have increased in the options market, indicating investors are fearful of a market correction.
So, as we approach late summer, which, historically, has been known for market volatility, it could be wise to bet on low-volatility ETFs now. We think the low beta values of iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (USMV), Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), and Legg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHD) make them ideal picks now.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 11:26AM ET</span>","GM issues new recall for nearly 69,000 Bolt EVs for fire risks","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Friday it is issuing a new recall for nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide for fire risks after reports of two fires and will replace defective battery modules as needed.
The Bolt EVs were recalled in November for fire risks and at least one of the two new fires was in a vehicle that had already had the software update released as part of that recall. 
The latest recall comes after GM and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulators last week urged Bolt owners to park their vehicles outside and away from homes after charging.
The largest U.S. automaker said ""experts from GM and (battery maker) LG have identified the simultaneous presence of two rare manufacturing defects in the same battery cell as the root cause of battery fires in certain Chevrolet Bolt EVs.""
GM said it will replace defective battery modules in the recall population, although it is not clear how many are defective. The recall includes 50,925 U.S. vehicles. 
GM and LG engineers are working ""to finalize all the steps of the recall repair process. That would include a potential dealer inspection process,"" GM said, adding that it ""could replace full packs or suspect modules.""
“The question is whether GM has the technological capability to detect and identify defective batteries. If there is not, they may have to replace the total batteries, which will be costly, like Hyundai did,” said South Korean battery expert and professor Park Chul-wan.
GM said earlier the high voltage batteries being recalled were produced at LG Chem Ltd's Ochang, South Korean facility. The recall does not impact newer Bolt vehicles with a next-generation battery.
NHTSA opened an investigation of the fire reports in October that is still open and is reviewing GM's recall fixes. The agency said Friday it is aware of one fire with the interim initial recall fix and two fires with the software fix.
The Chevrolet Bolt vehicles being recalled again are from the 2017-2019 model years and were first recalled for the potential of a fire in the high-voltage battery pack under the rear seat’s bottom cushion.
GM has confirmed nine total Bolt fires. 
GM said that all of the nearly 69,000 Bolt owners should return their vehicles to a 90% state of charge limitation that the company first instructed owners to use in November before the recall fix had been completed.
The automaker also asked owners to charge their vehicle after each use and avoid depleting the battery below approximately 70 miles of remaining range, where possible, to reduce the risk of a fire.
GM said it was still recommending customers park vehicles outside immediately after charging and not leave them charging overnight - and to get the software update as part of the initial recall.

GM has another generation battery planned when it launches EV Hummer and Cadillac vehicles over the next year.
GM shares were down about 1% in morning trading.

(Reuters) -Oilfield services giant Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) issued a bullish forecast for 2021 on Friday as second-quarter profit topped estimates due to surging margins, with a rebound in oil prices boosting demand for its software and equipment.
Energy services firms are benefiting from a resumption of drilling driven by rising crude prices, which are up 18% in the latest quarter and 42% since the start of 2021.
Still, oilfield activity levels remain far below pre-pandemic levels and oil demand could face a threat as a resurgence of infections from coronavirus variants prompts fresh restrictions in some parts of the world. 
Schlumberger officials offered an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year, and said they expect further growth and margin expansion in the company's North American and international operations. 
International revenue could rise at a double-digit percentage rate compared with year-ago levels, officials said. Its North American business, which fell 1% versus a year ago, could ""surprise to the upside"" due to spending by private operators, Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said. 
""Industry projections of oil demand reflect the anticipation of a wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improving road mobility, and the impact of various economic stimulus programs,"" Le Peuch said, cautioning the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten the demand recovery.
U.S. oil output may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2022, Le Peuch said, adding that international supply and demand conditions would push oil and gas activity beyond 2019 levels in the next two to three years.
Rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) this week also delivered a bullish outlook for the oil industry recovery, while Baker Hughes missed earnings expectations following a hit from restructuring charges.
Schlumberger reported net income of $431 million, or 30 cents per share, for the three months to June 30, compared with $299 million, or 21 cents per share, in the first quarter. Wall Street analysts had anticipated earnings of 26 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Operating margins nearly doubled to 14.3%, the highest since 2018, led by big gains in its software and reservoir performance units. Those gains, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, reflected past cost-cutting and big year-over-year software revenue increases. 

Analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said the results were strong, but lamented that Schlumberger's stock - along with other oilfield companies - had continued to underperform.
Shares were up a fraction in early trading at $28.08. They are up about 28% year-to-date, trailing the jump in oil prices.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 11:07AM ET</span>","Once its strength, water now threatens Germany","By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
BAD MUENSTEREIFEL, Germany (Reuters) - Bad Muenstereifel's transformation from picturesque but sleepy German tourist town into an outlet shopping centre put it on the map for millions of visitors. 
Then floods laid waste to its medieval streets and half-timbered buildings, highlighting the vulnerability of Europe's top economy to an increasingly unpredictable climate.
Beyond the town, the flooding stretched from an area close to the western city of Cologne down to southern Bavaria, hitting the historic centres of Aachen and Trier and leaving a trail of destruction behind it.
In recent years, other heavy floods have hit other parts of Germany, overflowing the banks of the waterways that have played such a key role in its prosperity. 
Those floods have caused tens of billions of euros of damage - a much bigger economic hit than any of Germany's neighbours have suffered from inundations, according to a study by Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY), which insures insurers. 
In Bad Muenstereifel, the focus was on the immediate damage. As scores of soldiers passed orange buckets of debris and sludge, Marita Hochguertel recalled the town's revamp after 2014, when an investor brought in dozens of outlet shops to fill empty storefronts. 
Visitors more than doubled to 2.5 million a year, sparking a renovation boom, said Hochguertel, who has worked for the town government for 42 years.
""It brought life to the town,"" she said outside the council building as muddy crews worked with bulldozers to clear wreckage, from broken chairs to the stray legs of mannequins.
Rubbish piles grew bigger as the day wore on. The smells of diesel-fuelled water pumps and dust polluted the air. A crushed car lay lodged sideways in the narrow river. 
The images have shocked Germany, prompting a debate ahead of national elections that could loosen the hold on power of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and bolster the Green party.
COSTLIEST EVER 
Much of Germany's industry, including metals giant Thyssen Krupp and chemicals giants Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and BASF, developed in centres close to waterways such as the Rhine - which was also impacted in the recent flooding.
The network of rivers and canals remains the most extensive in Europe and is used to move around 200 million tonnes of freight each year, from grain to coal and oil. But it is fast becoming a threat.
These were the third major floods to hit Germany since the turn of the century.
In 2002, the Elbe river flooded, affecting Dresden and other cities. In 2013, floods hit Bavaria hard along the Danube and Inn rivers.
Damage for both years totalled 42 billion euros, and less than a quarter of it was insured, according to Swiss Re.
July's floods are set to be Germany's costliest ever, according to the German Insurance Association, which estimated claims alone at up to 5 billion euros. 
The total cost, with torn roads, train tracks and phone lines, already seen in the billions, will far outstrip that. 
ICEYE, which monitors flood zones for insurers using satellite images, estimates that more than 37,000 German buildings have been affected by in July, compared with fewer than 1,700 in the neighbouring Netherlands.
Even before this most recent catastrophe, Swiss Re estimated the economic cost of flooding in Germany in recent decades at more than twice that of France or Britain.
But public debate, in a heavily industrialised country that relies on diesel cars, machinery and other goods to prosper, had been muted among large parts of the population. 
That may be about to change.
Anders Levermann, who has advised the German government on the climate, said he feared that floods could upend the economy and political order if they become much more common events.
""What will happen if weather extremes become so frequent that we don't have time to recover in between?"" he said. Germany's role as exporter means that supply chains across the globe could also be at risk, Levermann added. 
A LONG SLOG
In the Netherlands, where roughly half the country is below sea level and where they have spent centuries holding back water, planning has been ongoing for decades. It fared better in the recent floods.
""We've been anticipating this for a long time,"" said Marjolijn Haasnoot, a Dutch climate scientist. 
""This amount of flooding will occur much more frequently ... because of climate change."" 
The Dutch are also slowly embarking on a debate that may have to be had in Germany - over whether they should just surrender land to advancing water.
""A lot of people think they can protect everything with dykes. What they don’t realise is that sea water is seeping inland under the dykes,"" said Maarten Kleinhans of Utrecht University.
""In the long term, half of the country is under threat,"" he said, of Holland. ""We’ve seen it in the past - that villages and towns were washed away or disappeared into the ground. You can build sea walls to defend the cities, but you can’t do that everywhere."" 
Graphic: Floods in Germany - https://graphics.reuters.com/GERMANY-WEATHER/zjvqkqjjrvx/chart.png 
In Bad Muenstereifel, Michael Starkel, a hotel owner and head of the local business association, fears people will pack up and not return.
""I've talked to many people in the old town who really have thoughts to leave,"" he said during a break from helping the cleanup crews clear riverbeds of tree trunks and other detritus. 
If history is any indicator, people in the disaster zone are in for a long slog.

    Deggendorf, a town of 37,000 residents in Bavaria hit by floods and a dam break in 2013, is still recovering, Viola Muehlbauer, the head of the mayor's office, said.
    ""It will surely be a very, very long process until everything is back to normal.""

LONDON (Reuters) -KPMG's bank audits needed improvements for an ""unacceptable"" third year running and the accounting firm will be closely monitored, Britain's auditing watchdog said on Friday in an unusually blunt assessment of leading accountants.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said checks of 103 audits by KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, EY, Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO from 2019 and 2020 showed nearly a third required improvement, only a marginally better outcome than in its previous annual survey.
The results pile more pressure on the government to propose legislation to change corporate governance and the audit market after its consultation on recommendations in three government-backed reviews following the collapse of British retailer BHS and building firm Carillion. 
""Inspection results at KPMG did not improve and it is unacceptable that, for the third year running, the FRC found improvements were required to KPMG's audits of banks and similar entities,"" the FRC said in a statement.
""KPMG has agreed additional improvement activities to be delivered this year over and above its existing audit quality improvement plan,"" said the watchdog, which did not disclose which specific company audits it had checked.
KPMG UK, whose major banking clients include  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said the company was committed to delivering high-quality audits and was already working hard to make the necessary changes the FRC had highlighted.
""Whilst we know we have more to do to improve the inspection outcomes, our banking audits are robust and the findings do not call into question our audit opinions,"" Cath Burnet, KPMG UK's head of audit, said. 
""We are confident that the steps we have taken to date will result in improvements in future banking audit inspections."" 
KPMG is also facing a hefty fine from the FRC for its auditing of Carillion.
Britain's business ministry said the FRC report underscores the need to reform the audit sector, which is already underway.
Decisions have not yet been taken on when the government will publish a response to its consultation, or in exactly what form, a ministry spokesperson said.
The FRC said improvement measures were also expected at so-called challenger accountants BDO, which is headquartered in Belgium, and Mazars, which is based in France.
Deloitte, EY, Grant Thornton and PwC improved overall, with about 80% or more of audits requiring only limited changes, but the FRC said this score still fell short of its expectations.
EY said it was able to maintain audit quality standards despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, but recognised it had more to do.
CHALLENGER HOPES
The ICAEW, a professional accounting body based in London, said the FRC audit check ""has lost its way"".
""It has become an exercise in compliance checking and the public admonishment of auditors, and it does little to improve audit quality, foster innovation or encourage new entrants into the audit market,"" the ICAEW said in a statement.
The FRC said the most common issues were in relation to revenue, impairment of assets, and group audit oversight.
Five of the nine BDO audits and three of seven at Mazars needed more than limited improvements, the FRC said.
Only 44% of BDO's audits required no more than limited improvements while the equivalent figure was 57% for Mazars and 59% for KPMG, the FRC said.
The government is pinning hopes on ""challengers"" to take on more auditing work at blue-chip companies and dilute the market dominance of PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY, known as the Big Four.
Mazars said it was disappointed with the findings in this year's FRC report and it was addressing the issues identified.
""We are fully supportive of the FRC's efforts in holding our sector to account, and in demanding improvements in the quality of audit work,"" said David Herbinet, Mazar's head of audit.

Scott Knight, BDO's head of audit, said it was working hard to address specific findings and investing in extra resources such as increasing it audit headcount by more than 250 people or 14% within the last year.
Government plans to force Big Four auditors to share blue- chip clients with challenger firms has faced a major push back from companies, which say limits on the Big Four's market share would work better.

Investing.com – Shares of Chinese edtech companies tumbled by a massive 60% each on a Bloomberg report that said their home country is considering asking companies that offer tutoring on the school curriculum to go non-profit.
GSX Techedu (NYSE:GOTU), TAL Education (NYSE:TAL) and New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU) all fell. The news also inflicted collateral damaged on Didi's (NYSE:DIDI) stock, which was down 18%.
According to the report, the platforms will likely no longer be allowed to raise capital or go public. Listed firms may be barred from investing in or acquiring education firms teaching school subjects while foreign capital may also be kept out, the Bloomberg report said.
Following the news, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst D.S. Kim sharply cut the target prices of the three companies that are listed on the NYSE. The target for GSX is now set at $3.50, TAL Education at $7.60 and New Oriental at $3.50. Ratings for all were cut to neutral due to ""unprecedented uncertainty”.
The industry is under scrutiny as part of the Chinese government’s push to ease pressure on school children and the cost burden on parents.
If the Chinese government indeed takes the step, it will mean a loss of billions of dollars for American investors. It couldn’t have come at a worse time for some of those investors as they recently had their fingers burned in Didi and some other Chinese tech platforms.
Didi, which listed on the NYSE last month, has barely traded above its issue price, thanks to the probe it is now under.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal in June, Chinese regulators had asked it to defer its listing, pending a review of its data policy. The company ignored the advice then, a step that didn't go down well with the authorities. Many other Chinese tech platforms are under scrutiny now for their data privacy policies.

(Reuters) - Kevin Kelly is hitting his anti-vax workers where it may hurt them most: their paychecks.
On Sept. 1, when regular raises go through for the 250 workers at Emerald Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Inc.'s plastic bag factory outside San Francisco, those fully vaccinated will get a 3% bump, while those who resisted vaccination will get only half, 1.5%.
""With the Delta variant spreading quickly and likely to hit the unvaccinated here, and thus put everyone at risk for sickness, it likely is my last best shot to get people jabbed,"" said Kelly, chief executive of the family-owned manufacturing operation. 
Kelly plans to tell workers on Aug. 1, to give them time to get vaccinated if they want the larger raise.
A national vaccination campaign spearheaded by the Biden administration peaked at 3.3 million doses a day in mid-April and has been limping along at a daily pace of just over 500,000 since the Fourth of July holiday. At the current pace, most models show the country won't reach the lowest threshold for herd immunity - around 70% - until late this year.
Now, with those government efforts having stalled, companies like Kelly's have taken on the task of cajoling reluctant workers to get the vaccine. 
Unlike large swaths of the service sector - which can keep many workers remote in the face of a renewed virus wave - manufacturers and many other front-line businesses don't have that option, so some are getting creative in pushing people to take the vaccine. With order books bulging as the economy continues its recovery and labor supply already thin, many are fearful of losing staff time to the illness.
COVID-19 infections are increasing across the country, according to Reuters data, with some 40,000 infections reported on average every day. That’s 16% of the daily peak seen during the pandemic in January, but the fast-spreading Delta variant is now making headway, especially in many traditionally industrial Midwestern states where vaccination rates are lower than in coastal regions and major cities.
FROM 'STRONGLY ENCOURAGING' TO HERE'S $50
German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) has opened pop-up vaccine clinics at its larger U.S. sites and adjusted work schedules so that employees, and in many cases their dependents, can get shots conveniently. Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, the Moline, Illinois-based tractor maker, said it has no requirements that workers get the shots. But employees, as well as suppliers and other visitors to its locations, who are not vaccinated must continue to wear masks.
Forcing action on any medical issue is a delicate dance for employers. Even offering incentives must be done carefully, to avoid running afoul of workplace regulations protecting employee rights.
""We're not mandating - but we're strongly encouraging"" our workers to get the vaccine, said Jay Baker, chief executive of Jamestown Plastics Inc., a 150-employee firm in upstate New York. He also refuses to offer any incentives - like free food or raffles - and worries peer pressure among workers could devolve into ""unhealthy"" pressure. ""People saying - I got my turkey, why don't you have your turkey? It sounds like middle school.""
Bob Roth, co-owner of RoMan Manufacturing, a small producer of transformers and glass-molding equipment in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has offered workers a crisp $50 bill as a ""thank you gift"" for getting the shot. The company kept it small and called it a thank you, not a formal incentive, he said, because of the vagaries of federal labor law.
The cash has had limited impact. Only slightly more than half of Roth's workforce has gotten the vaccine, and Roth is flummoxed by the attitude of many of his anti-vax workers. Most of the reasoning he's heard is ""bizarre,"" he said, including worries about the vaccines causing sterility or being produced too quickly. ""No facts to back any of that crap up,"" he said.
Many companies fret that a wave of sickness could make it harder to keep up with already overflowing order books. Roth estimates his backlog of business is three times larger than a year ago, as the shutdown delayed work and strong economic growth is now fueling demand. 
At Emerald Packaging, which makes plastic bags used to package fresh produce like pre-cut lettuce, business has boomed during the pandemic and Kelly, the CEO, said the last thing he needs is another wave of workers having to stay away from work because of new infections. He estimates about 80% of his workers are vaccinated, while the remainder are roughly divided between people who are scared of vaccines and ""the other 10% that are just hardcore"" opposed.
""Everyone loved me during the pandemic, when I was doing all these things to keep people safe,"" he said. ""Now the anti-vax people all think I'm an asshole.""

He knows he won't ever get to 100%, but would like to get closer to 90%. ""We just need our own little herd immunity,"" he said.

Canada's largest carrier predicted slower cash burn as travel comes back, although bookings overall remain below pre-pandemic levels. 
""We are seeing steadily increasing bookings for the domestic, trans-border and Atlantic markets and to sun destinations for the coming winter,"" Chief Executive Michael Rousseau told analysts. ""In fact, for the next winter sun travel, future bookings during some weeks in June were ahead of the same period in 2019.""
Canada will allow fully vaccinated U.S. tourists to enter the country from Aug. 9, after the pandemic forced an unprecedented 16-month ban.
Air Canada reported a net cash burn of about C$8 million ($6.36 million) per day during the second quarter, lower than earlier projections. It expects that number to improve to between C$3 million and C$5 million per day in the third quarter.
Carriers are adding flights, putting pressure on fares in some markets.
While domestic pricing is more challenging, on international routes ""the environment is quite stable,"" Chief Commercial Officer Lucie Guillemette said while predicting a fall return in corporate travel.
Cargo flights, added during the pandemic, will be a more important part of the carrier's future, the airline said.
In April, Air Canada reached an aid deal with the country's federal government that would allow it to access up to C$5.9 billion in funds.
Rousseau said the airline would decide later this year whether to opt out of the government's financing facilities.
Excluding items, Air Canada lost C$3.03 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expected a C$2.76 loss.

The airline's net loss was C$1.17 billion, or C$3.31 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of C$1.75 billion, or C$6.44 per share, a year earlier.

Following a complaint from a consumer association, the court said there may be cases that justify sending luggage on a separate flight, but that Ryanair's clause was too generic. 
""(It leaves) to the will of the carrier to send the checked baggage on the same flight (as the passenger) or not under ... unspecified and absolutely unspecific circumstances of safety or operation,"" it said.
Irish carrier Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The Supreme Court also reaffirmed a previous ruling which annulled other clauses, including a 40 euro ($47) charge for reprinting a boarding pass, which it deemed disproportionate.

In 2019, it ruled that it was unfair for Ryanair to charge a fee for hand luggage.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened clearly higher on Friday, as impressive results from two big social media names after Thursday's close reinforced the sense that a consumer-led recovery is still very much intact.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 221 points, or 0.6%, at 35,045 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite, which hit a fresh record high on Thursday, added another 0.1%.
The market was lifted by strong results from Snap (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of Snapchat, and Twitter, which gave fresh reassurance that the reopening of the economy was unlocking pent-up animal spirits. Snap stock rose 24% after posting its strongest revenue growth in four years, Since the start of the pandemic, it's now gone from a low of below $8 to a current price of $78.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also beat expectations with its earnings on Thursday but it rose a less spectacular 1.8%. The read-across from Snap's report also benefited Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, which rose 2.0%, and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock, which rose 4.9%. 
The macro backdrop remained favorable: reports of fresh measures by the Biden administration drafting new measures to stop foreclosures provided more evidence that policymakers are unwilling to withdraw any of the emergency support measures that has so far gotten the U.S. economy through the pandemic. The underpinning of household incomes is widely seen as one of the factors allowing U.S. companies to pass on higher input costs to consumers without fear. Starbucks has been the latest to illustrate that trend, rising over 8% in a week when coffee futures have skyrocketed due to frost in Brazil that has cast huge doubt over the harvest this year - and for a couple of years to come - in the world's biggest producer. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock was up 1.3% in early dealings.
However, it wasn't all one-way traffic: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 5% after the chipmaker's guidance for the rest of the year hinted at further loss of market share in the data center chip segment, typically a higher-margin business.  Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) stock fell 26% after the brewer was forced to cut its guidance only three months after raising it. 
And no day is complete without another regulatory shock in China hitting the country's New York-listed ADRs. After the recent pile-on against Internet platform companies such as Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI)and Tencent, It was the turn of the educational technology companies on Friday, after Bloomberg reported that Beijing is mulling a move to make companies that offer tutoring on the school curriculum to go non-profit. TAL Education (NYSE:TAL) ADRs and New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE:EDU) ADRs both fell 60% on the report.  The move did nothing to reassure investors about the outlook for other Chinese ADRs, with ride-hailing giant Didi falling another 16% to a new record low.
Oil and gas stocks were also mostly lower, after oilfield services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) suggested that a sustained upturn in U.S. oil production is unlikely in the second half the year. It forecast international revenue would rise by more than 10% from a year earlier. But Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said revenue growth at its North American business was likely to slow from the 11% quarter-on-quarter rate seen through June."

(Reuters) -American Express Co's second-quarter profit blew past analysts' estimates on Friday, driven by a recovery in global consumer spending, especially on travel, as more people ventured out after the rollout of vaccines.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, logged double-digit growth in the second quarter, a Commerce Department report showed last week, as the economic reopening unleashed widespread demand for travel and shopping from consumers stuck indoors for more than 18 months.
The U.S. consumer has ""rocketed ahead on travel"", Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell told Reuters, with spending related to travel and entertainment on its cards within the United States reaching 98% of pre-pandemic levels.
On global travel and entertainment spending, he said it had recovered to nearly 70% of 2019 levels, two quarters earlier than previously expected.
Shares of the credit-card issuer, which recorded a benefit of $606 million from the release of its loan-loss reserves, rose nearly 4% to a record high of $177.49 in early trade.
Strong demand for premium, fee-based products helped drive the addition of U.S. Platinum card members to record levels, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said in a statement. 
The company sold 2.4 million new proprietary cards in the quarter, while spending on goods and services on its cards grew 16% on a currency adjusted basis.

Net income rose to $2.28 billion, or $2.80 per share, for the quarter ended June 30 from $257 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.67 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Excluding interest expense, AmEx's total revenue rose 33% to around $10.24 billion.

Investing.com – Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock rose 2% in Friday’s trading after the company swung back to profit as higher drilling, construction of more wells and cloud-based services targeted at oil and gas customers boosted revenue.
Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch cited potential for upside given the right business conditions.
In remarks focused on North America, he said, “. . .we anticipate the growth rate to moderate; however, drilling activity could still surprise to the upside due to private E&P operator spending”.
Rig count grew amid heightened oil drilling in all key geographies including the Middle East and Asia, Europe and Africa, North America and Latin America.  
The company bagged orders for construction of new wells and for expansion of capacities at existing ones. New orders also included work to extend the life of producing wells.
Revenue growth of 32% in the company’s digital services outpaced all other divisions.   
Net income for the second quarter was $431 million compared to a net loss $3.43 billion. Earnings per share was 30 cents.
Quarterly revenue rose 5% from a year ago to $5.63 billion.

The seven mandatory private pension funds manage assets worth 84.4 billion lei ($20.2 billion) for just over 7.6 million contributors. Those are primarily held in state treasuries and the stock market, where they are the largest institutional investors.
""It is increasingly becoming a challenge, new listings of ... large, profitable, quality companies are absolutely necessary for continued investment on the local capital market,"" Radu Craciun, president of Romania's private pension association, told Reuters.
""If we don't get local investment alternatives then attention towards foreign markets will likely increase as they have the liquidity the local bourse no longer provides,"" said Craciun, who manages one of the seven funds, BCR Pensii.
With a stock market capitalisation of around $33 billion, the Bucharest bourse ranks among the smallest in central and eastern Europe and badly needs diverse offerings. 
Initial public offerings in state-owned energy producer Hidroelectrica and other state holdings were delayed by legislative changes last year, which are in the process of being reversed.
BCR Pensii has bought into two regional private equity funds this year run by BlackPeak Capital and Ceecat Capital, the first Romanian pension fund to do so.
Romania overhauled its indebted, communist-era pension system in 2008, making it mandatory for all working Romanians under 35 to contribute to private pension schemes as well as their state pension.
Romanians will increasingly rely on private pensions particularly after 2030, when many of those born in a boom after a communist-era abortion ban in 1966 reach retirement age. 

The centrist coalition government has said it will raise employee private pension contributions to 4.75% of gross wages from the current 3.75% by 2024, but has yet to detail a plan.

The U.S. industrial conglomerate, which makes everything from aircraft engines to catalysts used in gasoline production, has seen its bottomline get a boost from rising domestic air traffic and higher demand for fuel as more people have started traveling following COVID-19 vaccinations.
""We are especially pleased to see a turnaround in several of our key end markets that were hardest hit by the pandemic, with commercial aerospace aftermarket and the UOP (energy) business returning to growth in the quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk said. 
Sales in Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON)'s aerospace unit, its biggest, rose 8.8% to $2.77 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, while revenue in its performance materials and technologies business that serves the energy sector jumped 15% to $2.55 billion.
Honeywell is also benefiting from increased investment in automation as e-commerce companies look to speed up automation to take on the explosive growth in demand.
This lifted sales in the company's safety and productivity solutions business, which makes warehouse automation equipment and counts Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) among its customers, by 35% to $2.08 billion in the quarter.
Honeywell said it now expects full-year sales to be between $34.6 billion and $35.2 billion, up from its prior forecast of $34 billion to $34.8 billion.

The move targets those with loans backed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Agriculture or Department of Veterans Affairs. They will be brought closer in line to those backed by Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), the White House said.
Homeowners who are still ""looking for work, re-training, having trouble catching up on back taxes and insurance, or are continuing to experience hardship for another reason,"" are eligible, it added in a statement. 
""Where agencies have the authority and depending on homeowners' financial conditions, agencies will require or encourage mortgage servicers to offer borrowers new payment reduction options to help them remain in their home.""
The Biden administration has taken several steps aimed at protecting homeowners during the COVID-19 outbreak, including extending an eviction moratorium until July 31. The pandemic has upended the nation's economy's since emerging in early 2020 and has caused more than 600,000 deaths. https://tmsnrt.rs/2W44vAe
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) last month finalized new protections for struggling homeowners as it seeks to prevent a wave of foreclosures in coming months, but it stopped short of a blanket ban.

LONDON (Reuters) -The owner of the discount chains Pepco, Poundland and Dealz, Pepco Group, plans to create about 13,000 net new jobs across Europe over the next three years as it aggressively opens new stores, its boss told Reuters.
Chief Executive Andy Bond said the majority of the new jobs would be in continental Europe, as it bets that shoppers will flock to cheaper stores following the devastation of the pandemic and as people search for bargains amid inflation.
While many European retailers have shifted operations online, shut stores and cut jobs to survive COVID-19, Pepco is heading in the other direction. 
""Unlike many bricks and mortar retailers which are all about stories of 'haven't we done a good job where we're staying alive', we're very confident about our growth,"" Bond, a former boss of British supermarket chain Asda, said.
Bond has said Pepco could benefit from inflationary pressure as people become more price-sensitive. 
Pepco Group, which listed on the Warsaw stock market in May and now has a 6.9 billion euro ($8.13 billion) valuation, currently employs around 35,000, trading from about 3,400 stores in 16 countries. It will start trading in its 17th, Austria, in September.
The group is targeting more than 1 billion euros in core earnings within five to seven years. In June it reported first-half underlying earnings of 324 million euros, up 16.8%. 
It draws comparisons with British discount retailer B&M, which has seen its shares rise 125% since the day before Britain entered its first pandemic lockdown. 
ONLINE SCEPTICISM
Like many discount retailers, Pepco has not embraced online deliveries when an average basket size is 7 to 8 euros. 
""Our consumer dynamic, our geographical spread and our business model make us most defendable against online and most unlikely to go online,"" said Bond. 
Poundland is, however, conducting a small online trial in central England to better understand customer demand.
""Personally, I've been very sceptical. However, it is such a macro trend, we've got to learn about it, because I have no intention of looking like the idiot who called the world flat when it was actually round,"" said Bond.
He said if there were customers who were willing to spend a basket of around 60 UK pounds ($82.37) it could be viable. The group is also looking for a partner in eastern Europe for a trial. 
Pepco shares have soared over 36% since listing. Priced at 40 zlotys at the IPO, they were trading at 54.5 zlotys on Friday.
""I think it's almost the optimum outcome both for buyer and seller that the share price goes up progressively post float,"" said Bond, who retains shares worth about 44.2 million euros. 
South African conglomerate Steinhoff, which is still grappling with the fallout from a 2017 accounting scandal, retains the majority of Pepco Group's equity, though that holding is controlled by creditors.

Second-quarter net income was $66 million against a net loss of $1.38 billion in the same period a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was 8 cents compared to a loss of 35 cents in 2020.
Ad engagements rose and so did the number of users the company milks through advertisements. The first item grew 32%. The micro blogging site closed the quarter with 206 million monetizable daily active users compared to 199 million as on December 31, 2020.
Daily active users in the U.S. fell by 1 million which the company attributed to a lighter news cycle in the country.    
Total revenue, including revenue from advertising and data licensing, increased 74% to $1.19 billion in the second quarter. Analysts expected the social media company to report revenue of $1.06 billion.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Volvo Cars reported a return to profit in the first half as demand for electric cars pushed earnings above pre-pandemic levels, putting the carmaker on a firmer footing as it considers a possible IPO this year.
Sweden-based Volvo, owned by China's Geely Holding, said on Friday it made a first-half profit of 13.24 billion Swedish crowns ($1.52 billion), more than double its profit of 5.52 billion crowns in the corresponding period of 2019, before the coronavirus struck.
Like several other automakers Volvo has been forced to cut production due to global shortages of semiconductors, but it said a strong market recovery from last year's plunge during the pandemic helped first-half revenue rise by 26% to 141 billion crowns.
""The pandemic effect, when it comes to our business, we don't see it anymore,"" Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson told Reuters.
""All our employees have not been vaccinated yet, but sales and production are really back to where we were.""
The company, which is eyeing an initial public offering before the end of this year, said all its regions showed solid growth and improved market shares, with chargeable cars representing 25% of total sales.
Samuelsson said the evaluation process ahead of a potential IPO was progressing according to plan, adding the firm was still considering listing on the Stockholm stock exchange in the second half of 2021.
""The company stands stronger than ever and we are in the midst of a very substantial transformation... It has to be financed and access to the stock market is of course positive then,"" Samuelsson said. 
Volvo Cars had been heavily affected at the start of the pandemic, plunging to a 989 million loss in the first half of 2020.
The company on Friday kept its second-half outlook for flat sales and revenue growth year on year, ""unless supply of semiconductors improves"". It said earlier this month that first-half sales rose 41% to 380,757 cars.

The Gothenburg-based firm plans to become a fully electric car maker by 2030, sell 600,000 battery electric vehicles at mid-decade, and build a European battery gigafactory in 2026.

The shares gained about 66% to close at 126 rupees in Mumbai Friday, compared with the IPO price of 76 rupees. Zomato raised $1.3 billion from investors including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Fidelity Investments in the share sale last week.
Zomato is leading several consumer-technology startups waiting to publicly trade shares in India, including the parent of digital-payments service Paytm, which has filed for the country’s biggest IPO at $2.2 billion. The listing caps a busy first half for domestic listings as local indexes hover near record highs, buoyed by cash injections by central banks worldwide.
“It’s a new dawn for the consumer-tech businesses in the listed space,” said Rakhi Prasad, an investment manager with Alder Capital. The sector is relatively underrepresented in Indian public markets, compared with 30% market capitalization among the 100-biggest listed firms in the U.S. and China, she said.
The IPO will be a boon for Ant Group Co., which is benefiting from its early investments in Indian Internet companies including Zomato and Paytm. The Chinese financial-services firm initially invested in Zomato in 2018 and had a stake of about 16% before the share sale.
“Zomato with first mover advantage is placed in a sweet spot as the online food delivery market is at the cusp of evolution,” said Sneha Poddar, an analyst with Mumbai-based Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. She said Zomato has gained market share over the past four years, and its stock is a good long-term bet though “predicting the growth trajectory at this juncture is little tricky.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, boosted by strength in the tech sector after positive earnings from social media giants Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 160 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 70 points, or 0.5%.
The major equity indices closed higher Thursday and are now on course to close the week higher, the fourth positive week in five, even given Monday’s sharp sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the way Thursday, and is likely to dominate again Friday. 
Twitter stock soared over 5% premarket after the social media platform reported higher than expected revenue growth in the second quarter, helped by ad targeting improvements to help brands reach potential customers.
Snap stock posted even greater gains after the owner of the messaging app Snapchat beat estimates for users and revenue in the second quarter, notching the highest growth rates since late 2017.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) could prove the exception, with the chipmaker’s stock seen lower premarket after it offered up a disappointing forecast for the ongoing financial year that hinted at ongoing loss of market share in its key data center business.
Major technology companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are set to report second-quarter earnings next week. Ahead of this, reports from the likes of  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) and  Kimberly Clark  (NYSE:KMB) will be in the spotlight Friday.
In economic news, U.S. manufacturing and services PMI survey data for July are expected to show a continued recovery. The equivalent data showed Eurozone business activity expanded at its fastest monthly pace in over two decades in July.  
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Friday, stabilizing after a volatile trading week. The crude market has posted gains of around 8% over the last three days, largely recouping Monday’s slump, when sentiment was hit by worries over rising Covid cases and an agreement between top producers to add supply. 
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $71.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $73.53.
Baker Hughes’ weekly rig count will attract attention later Friday, as will the commitment of traders reports from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",UK needs 10 times as many EV charge-points by 2030 -regulator,"By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -Britain's competition regulator on Friday laid out guidelines to ensure a robust electric vehicle (EV) charging network to aid the country's net zero plans, as it also launched a probe into some charge-point operators on highways and motorways.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Britain could require 10 times as many EV charge-points before 2030, as part of its study into the EV charging market to assesses availability and reliability of the charging points. 
The regulator found that while the country's network was growing, some parts were facing problems which could hinder a broader rollout, adding that Britain currently has around 25,000 charge-points.
""Electric vehicles play a critical role in meeting Net Zero but the challenges with creating an entirely new charging network should not be underestimated,"" CMA boss Andrea Coscelli said. 
""Some areas of the roll-out are going well ... but it's clear that other parts, like charging at motorway service stations and on-street, have much bigger hurdles to overcome.""
Britain wants to have net zero emissions by 2050.
CMA said it was concerned about choices of charge-points at motorway service stations, where competition is limited, and added that it was looking into arrangements lasting 10-15 years between Electric Highway and operators MOTO, Roadchef and Extra. 
Electric Highway makes up 80% of all points at motorway service stations in Britain, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) charge-points, CMA said.
Roadchef said it had cooperated fully with the CMA on its market study. ""As this matter (the investigation) is still under investigation, we are unable to comment further at present,"" a spokesperson said.
The other companies involved did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The move by CMA comes ahead of a UK ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030, and the regulator announced advice for the government to ""ensure that using and paying for charging is as simple as filing up with petrol and diesel.""
With its 2030 deadline looming followed by its 2035 cut-off for hybrids, Britain needs more battery factories - and fast.
CMA said the postcode lottery system to develop EV charging needed to change, and pointed to discrepancies between the number of points available in areas such as Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.

It also recommended that a 950 million pound ($1.3 billion) government fund to set up more charge-points must have new conditions attached, and that a public body must be tasked with monitoring the sector.

Investing.com – Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock soared more than 16% in Friday’s premarket trading following an upbeat second quarter and a guidance that indicated continued momentum at the social media outlet.
Thursday’s after-market trading had briefly catapulted the company to over $100 billion market cap.
The company’s efforts at attracting advertisers and users alike bore fruit as both revenue and daily active users recorded their highest growth in 4 years.
Snap's second-quarter revenue jumped 116% year-on-year to $982 million, well above the expectation of $844.63 million.
The social media platform, known for its short-lived messages, expects its third-quarter revenue to rise 58%-60% year-over-year to clock between $1.07 billion and $1.08 billion.
Average revenue per user, a key indicator of how much the company managed to pocket from each user every month, jumped 76% to $3.35, going some way to address long-standing concerns that Snapchat doesn't monetize its customer base effectively.
Daily active user numbers rose 23% to 293 million and analysts expect this to grow to 298.5 million by the end of the ongoing quarter, according to Reuters.
The company’s net loss more than halved to $152 million from $326 million from the same quarter a year ago. Revenue jumped 116% to $982 million.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share improved to 10 cents from 9 cents earlier.

The Bloomberg News report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-23/china-is-said-to-mull-turning-tutoring-firms-into-non-profits said that under rules being considered but which may change companies that offer tutoring could be asked to eschew profits and could be forbidden from raising capital or going public.
The sector is under scrutiny as part of a push to ease pressure on school children and the cost burden on parents.

Reuters reported in June that authorities were set to announce measures including trial bans on tutoring during summer and winter holidays. 
Tutoring stocks tumbled on Friday, with Hong Kong listed shares of New Oriental Education and Technology Group falling 40% to its lowest since listing last year and shares in New York-listed TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) and Gaotu Techedu Inc roughly halving in pre-market trade.

BofA's number crunchers who analyse weekly investment flow figures from EPFR said funds had bought $8.4 billion worth of bonds overall including $2.6 billion of U.S. government bonds.
The figures cover the week up to Wednesday and therefore the powerful rally in bond markets on Monday when the resurgence in global COVID cases seemed to suddenly ignite fears about the likelihood of economies being able to return to normal.

There had also been the largest withdrawal from U.S. stocks in 6 weeks at $2.6 billion and the largest outflow from European stocks and gold since March at $700 million and $1 billion respectively.
It hasn't been all gloom though. BofA estimated that funds have pumped $3.3 billion into stocks worldwide, although the fact $1.6 billion went into tech and $1.5 billion went into healthcare stocks again highlights the virus' impact.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not revised its masking guidance, even as the Delta variant of the coronavirus sweeps the United States, driving up infections, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said on Thursday. 
Walensky declined to say if the CDC is considering changing the guidance. The CDC in May relaxed its guidance so that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks in most public spaces. 
Her comments coincided with reports that administration officials were discussing whether to shift guidance about masking in response to outbreaks caused by the Delta variant. 
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said such a decision would be made by the CDC, and President Joe Biden said experts were studying any necessary changes.
""What they're doing is they're ... investigating every aspect of any change that could or might take place,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. ""We follow the science.""
The president said on Wednesday that the CDC is likely to advise unvaccinated children to wear masks in school as districts around the country prepare to reopen for the coming school year.
The seven-day average of new cases in the United States is up 53% over the previous week, Walensky said. The Delta variant, which was first found in India, now comprises more than 80% of new cases nationwide and has been detected in more than 90 countries. 
Some hospitals around the United States are reaching their capacity limits as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge, Walensky said. 
The uptick in cases is concentrated in regions with lower vaccination rates. Florida, Texas and Missouri account for 40% of all new cases nationwide, with around 1 in 5 of all new U.S. cases occurring in Florida, White House COVID-19 task for director Jeffrey Zients said. 
Zients said that the United States will continue to distribute tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. 
The White House in June announced plans to distribute around 80 million COVID-19 vaccines globally.

Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said there is no reason for people who received Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine to assume that they need to get an additional shot of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's vaccines to protect themselves against new variants of the virus. 
The CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration are reviewing data to see if there is waning immunity in vaccinated people to determine if additional booster shots are needed.

The company raised its outlook for FY21 revenue by only $1 billion to $73.5 billion, an indication that growth may be slowing after a strong year since the pandemic struck..  
Intel also raised the outlook for annual earnings per share by 20 cents from the previous forecast to $4.80.  
Third-quarter EPS is seen at $1.10 on revenue of $18.2 billion.
According to separate comments Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger made to Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, the ongoing shortage of chips could spillover into 2023.
""We are helping them build factories as fast as they can,"" Gelsinger told Reuters. ""But it will be one of those things that just takes a couple years to fully catch up to this explosive demand we’re seeing, and we have better tools to address it than others."" 
Intel is pumping in $20 billion to set up two chip-making factories in Arizona. Reports say it is in talks to buy GlobalFoundries for $30 billion. Intel hasn't commented on the reports. 
The Intel CEO also told The Wall Street Journal that supply shortages should begin to ease later this year.
The surge in demand for work from home solutions in the pandemic brought big business to both software and IT hardware companies but it has also proven to be too much for them. Supplies have fallen short as demand surged not just from manufacturers of laptops, mobiles and digital gadgets, but also from other sectors that are relatively new to the digitization trend. 
Prices have moved up significantly, boosting profits across the sector. Intel's adjusted EPS rose 12% from the same quarter a year ago to $1.28. Revenue rose 2% to $18.5 billion, exceeding April's guidance by $700 million.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss contract drugmaker Lonza raised its 2021 outlook on Friday after booming business making ingredients for COVID-19 vaccines and strong growth elsewhere helped it beat analysts' expectations during the first half of the year.
The company, which has intensified agreements with vaccine producer  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), said sales to the U.S. company had exceeded expectations, although it was also seeing a broad-based improvement in sales of non-coronavirus related products.
""In the prior year we provided an estimate for how much we expected from Moderna sales for 2021...the number is much higher given our ability to increase output at our existing facilities,"" Chief Financial Officer Rodolfo Savitzky told reporters.
Following a 13.3% increase in sales during the first half of 2021, the Basel company said it now expects sales to increase in constant exchange rates towards the mid-teens percentage level this year.
Its previous guidance had been for sales growth in the low double-digit range. 
Savitsky said although the increased sales of COVID-19 related products played a role in the upgrade, their impact should not be overstated.
""Covid (products) still represent a relatively small part of our overall sales,"" he said. ""It has an impact, but we see strong momentum across the whole portfolio.""
For the first half of the year, Lonza posted sales of 2.54 billion Swiss francs ($2.76 billion), beating analysts' forecasts for 2.47 billion francs.
Core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 13% to 847 million francs, also beating the 787 million francs forecast in a company-gathered poll of analysts.
""All in all, a good set of figures,"" said Bank Vontobel analyst Sibylle Bischofberger. 
Lonza shares, which have outpaced the blue-chip Swiss Market Index by rising 19.4% in 2021, gained 2.1% in early trading. 
The company is responding to rising demand by increasing its capital expenditure to 474 million francs in the first half of the year.
More spending was to come in the second half of the year, talking the 2021 capex level to 25% of sales, up from the usual level of around 20%.
Among the investments has been the addition of three extra production lines at the company's plant in Visp, Switzerland, while another line has been added at its site at Geleen in the Netherlands.
Lonza has also hired 1,000 more workers in the first half of the year, and planned to take on another 2,000 in the second half to tackle production log-jams.

Koerner joined Credit Suisse from UBS in April, when Switzerland's second-biggest bank began overhauling its asset management business amid the implosion of around $10 billion of funds related to British supply chain financier Greensill.

Meanwhile, ad interim chief of staff Henning Wechsung will become the division's head of strategy, Koerner said.

""Their expertise in asset and wealth management, combined with their strategic mindset, will be very valuable as we continue to define our future path in line with Credit Suisse's overall strategy,"" he said in the memo.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Shares of Signify fell as much as 9% early on Friday as the world's largest lighting maker said a lack of parts had reduced output and the problem could persist for many more months.
Other industry executives have already said a semiconductor shortage could last well into 2022, as one-off purchases to meet work-from-home needs drive demand.
Signify has also struggled to source other components, including some metals and plastics.
Chief Executive Eric Rondolat said 85 million euros ($100 million) in sales had been missed in the first six months of the year.
""We could do more if we had more components,"" Rondolat told reporters. ""Recovery could come maybe in the fourth quarter, probably in the beginning of next year. But it's a very tough situation."" 
Signify shares rallied slightly to trade down 6.5% at 0750 GMT in Amsterdam. They are still up almost 25% since the start of the year after a strong rally in recent months.
""Second quarter results were not as strong as expected (and) Signify mentions supply constraints as a limiting factor,"" ING analyst Marc Hesselink wrote in a note.
The company, formerly known as Philips Lighting, said comparable sales were up 14% in the second quarter from a year before — when the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a deep slump — as consumer demand jumped, especially for networked lights that can be adjusted by mobile phone.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation (EBITA) increased 32% to 175 million euros.
The improved results fell short of analyst expectations in a company-compiled poll.

Signify maintained its outlook for a 3% to 6% comparable sales growth for 2021.

The result lagged pre-pandemic 2019, when Skanska posted a second-quarter profit of 2.74 billion crowns, but investors cheered the performance, with Skanska's shares up 6% at 0800 GMT. 
""Overall, market uncertainty is starting to decrease, and activity is picking up in our markets,"" the company said in a statement. 
""With higher activity levels, we are noticing bottlenecks and shortages of certain materials in the supply chain, causing price increases and increased price volatility.""
CEO Anders Danielsson told Reuters the biggest increases had been for steel and wood, and to some extent plastic products. 
""Here we have seen higher prices, some bottlenecks, and also big variations in price. I believe this will continue for some time,"" he said in an interview. 
""Our approach to managing these risks is that before we bid for a contract we nail down as many prices as possible, and as much delivery capacity."" 
Profit growth was powered by its Construction division which is refocusing on higher-margin projects, and by high activity and profitability at its residential property development business. 
Skanska's commercial property development business had a relatively muted quarter although investor interest remained strong. Uncertainty still hampered the leasing market but activity is picking up, it said.
Orders at Construction, which books the bulk of group revenue, jumped 35% to 49.8 billion crowns while its operating margin widened to 4.7% from 2.2%. 

Swedish forestry group SCA said on Friday demand for solid wood products continued to strengthen supported by the building materials and construction sectors.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by a supportive tone from the European Central Bank and more positive quarterly corporate earnings.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7%.
The ECB kept its very accommodative monetary policy in place on Thursday, maintaining its benchmark interest rate at 0% as well as its 1.85 trillion euro asset-purchase scheme, while also tying its new forward guidance on interest rates more closely to inflation, suggesting they aren't likely to rise anytime soon.
This update suggests the ECB is now one of the more dovish members of the central bank club, likely supporting the recovery the stock market has made from Monday’s rout.
Also helping has been the generally strong quarterly corporate updates in the early stages of this earnings season, and Friday was no exception.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) stock reached a new 52-week high after the French defense electronics company, Europe’s largest, raised its full-year revenue target after posting an almost 10% gain in first-half revenues
Skanska stock soared over 6% after the Swedish builder reported a hefty jump in second-quarter profit as building activity rebounded, while Lonza (SIX:LONN) stock rose 2.8% after the Swiss chemicals company lifted its 2021 outlook on Friday after sales for the first half of the year came in ahead of expectations.
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) stock rose 2.3% after the U.K. telecoms giant reported a better-than-expected 3.3% rise in first-quarter service revenue on Friday, with Europe returning to growth. 
On the flip side, Signify (AS:LIGHT) stock fell almost 6% after the world's largest lighting maker bemoaned supply chain issues while reporting a 32% jump in second-quarter core profit.
Turning to economic data, the German flash composite PMI rose to 62.5 in July from 60.1 in June, hitting its highest level in nearly a quarter of a century, helped by an easing of virus containment measures in Europe's largest economy. The news was less impressive in France, with its composite PMI falling to 56.8 points in July from 57.4 in June, its lowest figure in three months.
U.K. retail sales rose 0.5% on the month in July, a welcome improvement after the previous month’s 1.4% slump, climbing 9.7% on the year.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Thursday, stabilizing after a volatile trading week. The crude market has posted gains of around 8% over the last three days, largely recouping Monday’s slump, when sentiment was hit by worries over rising Covid cases and an agreement between top producers to add supply. 
At 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $71.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $73.56.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,808.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1783.

The remarks were made by Gao Wei, deputy mayor of Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province, in a meeting with bank executives and local financial and state asset regulators, on Thursday, according to the statement.
Gao said the city government values the reforms in Shengjing bank and will strengthen the Communist Party leadership in the bank to help it develop into ""a good bank,"" according to the statement.
He did not elaborate on when and by how much the stake purchase will be arranged.
Controlled by China's most indebted developer Evergrande, the financial health of Shengjing has been put under spotlight since May, after financial news outlet Caixin reported that country's top banking watchdog was probing connected transactions worth over 100 billion yuan ($15.45 billion) between Evergrande and the bank.
In a statement on July 5, Evergrande said its financial business with Shengjing complies with legal requirements.
Shengjing reported a net profit of 1.2 billion yuan in 2020, down 78% from a year earlier.
The bank's non-performing loan ratio stood at 3.26% by the end of 2020, higher than the industry-wide average of nearly 2%.
Despite repeated statements on its sound financing ability, investors continued to dump shares and bonds of Evergrande amid a government crackdown on developers' funding sources.
On Friday, Evergrande shares were on track for their biggest weekly drop since plunging more than 26% in late September 2011.
Some banks in Hong Kong, including HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), also decided to decline loans to buyers of Evergrande's incomplete residential projects, Reuters reported.

Europe's largest defence electronics company, whose systems range from radar to rail, and biometric sensors to satellites, said the increase reflected a broad rebound compared with the worst stages of the pandemic, except for civil aerospace.
New orders rose 37% to 8.244 billion euros ($9.70 billion), led by major satellite contracts in Europe and Indonesia.
Chief Executive Patrice Caine said the order boost lent confidence, while warning the business climate ""continues to be disrupted.""
Thales' overall operating income more than doubled to 768 million euros in the first half from 348 million a year earlier, as half-yearly sales reached 8.423 billion euros.
Thales now expects 2021 sales of 17.5-18.0 billion euros, compared with a previous target of 17.1-17.9 billion.
Thales's shares were up 1.4% in early session trading.
Thales' new sales outlook assumes no major new economic or public-health disruptions and a return to normal in the global semiconductor supply chain, the company said. 
In May, it said it had seen no significant impact from a global shortage of chips used by its identity and bank payments businesses, but was adding new suppliers.
Caine declined comment on speculation surrounding the potential sale of the company's rail signalling business.
Reuters reported this month that Thales had shortlisted Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Rail, Switzerland's  Stadler Rail  (SIX:SRAIL) and Spain's CAF for the business, which analysts have valued between 1.5 billion and 2.5 billion euros.

The French aerospace group, partially owned by the French state, is seeking to streamline its operations after investors often questioned the diversity of its portfolio.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Friday, ending a volatile week on a positive note, helped by a supportive tone from the European Central Bank.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
The ECB, as was largely expected, did not adjust its benchmark interest rate or its commitment to purchase 1.85 trillion euro in bonds through March 2022 at its latest meeting on Thursday. However, it did tie its new forward guidance on interest rates more closely to inflation, suggesting they aren't likely to rise anytime soon.
“With an inflation projection currently of 1.4% YoY for 2023 and the new forward guidance, interest rates will remain low for even longer,” said analysts at ING, in a note.  
This policy update suggests the ECB is now one of the more dovish members of the central bank club, likely supporting the recovery the market has made from Monday’s rout following concerns surging Covid numbers, caused by the highly-transmissible delta variant, would stall the nascent global economic recovery.
The tech sector is likely to be in focus in Europe Friday following strong second-quarter reports by U.S. social media giants Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) after the close on Wall Street Thursday.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP), Europe's largest defense electronics company, raised its full-year revenue target after posting first-half revenues up by 9.8% on a like-for-like basis.
Other earnings from the likes of Signify (AS:LIGHT) and Lonza (SIX:LONN) will be of interest, while U.K. telecoms giant Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) issued a trading update ahead of expectations.
The economic data slate includes a slew of surveys on the manufacturing and services sectors in Europe later Friday, which are expected to show a slight softening of activity, albeit from high levels. Additionally, U.K. retail sales rose 0.5% on the month in July, a welcome improvement after the previous month’s 1.4% slump, climbing 9.7% on the year.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>",Pandemic-hit Canadian businesses call for eleventh hour aid extension,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Richard Vanderlubbe, owner of Canadian travel agency Tripcentral.ca, has had to cut active staff to about 15% of the total workforce and close all physical locations since the coronavirus pandemic's start, despite receiving the wage subsidy and business loan.
As the Canadian economy gradually reopens, the government is winding down these programs. But Vanderlubbe and other businesses hardest hit by the pandemic are calling for the extension of support until all restrictions are lifted, warning that failure to do so could choke many of them at the eleventh hour.
""The subsidies have been a lifeline,"" Vanderlubbe said, particularly as travel agencies' revenues have evaporated even as staff have had to keep working. ""The company has to go more into debt or I have to put personal assets into the business... or lose it,"" he added.
While the worst-hit businesses from the pandemic are mostly related to tourism, events and recreation, they made up less than 5% of the economy in 2020. Still, they employed about 1.5 million of Canada's 18 million-strong workforce. 
Their struggles contrast sharply with much of the rest of the economy, which is bouncing back strongly, with employment within 1.8% of pre-pandemic levels and further recovery forecast.
""It's one thing to look at things in macro and say it's not a big impact, but these are significant to the individual business owners,"" Conference Board of Canada's Director of Economic Forecasting, Ted Mallett, said.
Nearly 60% of the most affected businesses will not survive if the subsidies are not extended through 2021, surveys by the Coalition of Hardest Hit Business (CHHB) showed.
""The timing they've proposed makes sense for 95% of the economy,"" said Hotel Association of Canada (HAC) Chief Executive Susie Grynol. 
But ""it does not make sense to invest in the (hardest-hit) businesses... then drop them right before the finish line, which could result in a collapse of the industry,"" she added.
Already, the pandemic-driven emergency wage and rent subsidies have fallen to 60% of eligible expenses this month and are scheduled to decline to 20% by September. And the business loan program stopped accepting new applications on June 30. 
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland this week reiterated that the government is prepared to extend the support until the end of November if needed.
Business lobby groups are petitioning for the programs to remain for the most affected businesses. 
""Politicians are anxious, understandably, to turn the page on this, because these programs are super expensive, and move forward to other agenda items,"" said CFIB CEO Dan Kelly. ""So the momentum... to fix some of the programs seems to have slowed.""
So far, the government has approved C$86 billion ($68.4 billion) for wage subsidies and C$48.4 billion of business loans, official data show. 
Additional aid of a few billion dollars, introduced more recently for the hardest-hit industries and small businesses, is not sufficient, the business groups said. 
""The number of bankruptcies has started to rise,"" said Lori Sterling, senior counsel at law firm Bennett Jones and former federal deputy labour minister.

""It's not huge at this stage but small businesses are predicting there will be a tsunami of bankruptcies,""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning but ended the week on a cautious note as investors digested the latest U.S. economic data and earnings.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.22% by 9:56 PM ET (1:56 AM GMT) and in Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.04%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index Index fell 0.65%
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.34% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.33%. Didi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) came under scrutiny as regulators mull serious, even unprecedented penalties to punish the ridesharing company after its controversial U.S. IPO in June 2021.
Japanese markets were shut for a holiday, ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games’ opening ceremony later in the day. However, in an unprecedented move, the event will take place without spectators due to the state of emergency declared in the country.
U.S. shares edged toward an all-time high, with S&P 500 recording its biggest three-day advance since April 2021 and the Nasdaq 100 closing at a record.
Longer-term U.S. Treasuries broke a two-day fall, with strong demand for an auction of 10-year inflation-protected securities producing a record-low yield.
Investors also digested the latest corporate earnings, where technology firms such as  Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ:MSFT) rallied while cyclicals lagged.  Twitter Inc . (NYSE:TWTR) shares jumped on an upbeat outlook, but  Intel Corp .'s stock (NASDAQ:INTC) fell thanks to a lower-than-expected sales forecast.
Global shares are set to end the week with a modest gain, with investors regaining their risk appetites thanks to generally strong corporate earnings and reassurance that central banks will keep their dovish stance on monetary policy.
However, the decline in benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields in July could be a signal that economic growth is peaking, as the number of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant continues its upward trend and force more countries to impose restrictive measures.
The U.S. is “at another pivotal moment in this pandemic,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said, as the number of daily cases involving the variant continues to rise in unvaccinated pockets of the population.
“One of the most under-appreciated things about the equity markets right now is just how much these earnings have risen, and how much analysts have had to revise their earnings estimates up,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Bloomberg. She added that she is tracking the Delta variant in case it affects consumer behavior and the shift in the recovery from “great to really good.”
Investors also digested the latest economic data, with a higher-than-expected 419,000 initial jobless claims filed throughout the past week. The number was at a two-month high, with 368,000 claims filed during the previous week and 350,000 claims forecast by Investing.com.
The data also said existing home sales also rose to 5.86 million in June, for the first time in five months. The U.S. manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes for July are also due later in the day."
83,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 08:30PM ET</span>","U.S. Senate panel hears from Chubb, others on insuring pandemic risk","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey business owner Adenah Bayoh told a U.S. Senate committee hearing on Wednesday she paid about $275,000 a year to insure her group of restaurants, only to discover the limits of her policy during the coronavirus pandemic.
""When the pandemic hit and the governor ordered my businesses to close, I was shocked that my insurance company and coverage was not there for me,"" said the Liberia native who immigrated to the United States at age 13 and now owns seven restaurants.
Insurers have largely denied claims for business interruption caused by the pandemic, saying the virus did not cause the physical damage that policies require.
The hearing, spurred by hundreds of thousands of experiences like Bayoh's, highlighted the challenges of insuring overwhelming risks like coronavirus, and drew on industry leaders for possible solutions. 
""Shutting entire economies down for an extended period and spending the kinds of trillions of dollars we've spent as a way of managing a pandemic is not a future solution,"" Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd Chief Executive Evan Greenberg told the subcommittee that deals with insurance. 
Preparation and better response would shorten shutdowns and may allow insurers and government to share the risk, he added.
Other ideas ranged from adapting the system used to insure terrorism risk after 9-11, also being discussed by House members, allowing insurers to cover initial losses and government to cover longer-term claims. Insurers also could help distribute government support without covering risk.
One proposal would do nothing, noting that in hindsight, government support and stimulus largely healed the economy.

""A reasonable assessment is that no program is needed,"" said Robert Hartwig, a professor at the University of South Carolina. 
Bayoh, who struggled to get a paycheck protection program loan, disliked that solution. ""I hope that I'm not sitting here in the next pandemic hoping for another PPP,"" she said.

(Reuters) -Twitter Inc on Thursday reported higher revenue growth than Wall Street had expected, as the social media platform rolled out ad targeting improvements to help brands reach potential customers.
Shares of Twitter rose 5% to $73 in trading after the bell.
Since the start of the year, Twitter has raced to introduce products in new areas like audio-only chat rooms and newsletter publishing in an effort to turn around years of business stagnation and reach its goal of doubling annual revenue by 2023.
Advertising revenue totaled $1.05 billion, up 87% from the year-ago quarter, and beat Wall Street estimates of $909.9 million.
Twitter has worked to improve the effectiveness of its ads, introducing 2,500 new topic categories during the quarter to help users find content they're interested in, all of which provides more ad targeting data back to Twitter, the company said on a conference call with analysts.
""We get great signal about what people are most interested in, where they are or the places they care about,"" said Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal during the call.
Those improvements, along with higher demand from advertisers seeking to reach consumers as countries reopen from pandemic restrictions, helped propel ad revenue, Twitter said.
The strong results from both Twitter and its tech peer  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which reported quarterly revenue growth of 116% on Thursday, shows ""that the overall digital ad market is on fire right now, with the reopening further strengthening advertisers' budgets,"" said Ygal Arounian, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Twitter reported 206 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU), its term for users who are served advertising, for the second quarter ended June 30, matching analyst targets of 205.9 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Its U.S. user base declined by 1 million over three months from the previous quarter due to a lighter news cycle in the United States, Twitter said, with total users worldwide in line with Wall Street targets.
Total revenue, which also includes revenue the company earns from data licensing, rose 74% year-over-year to $1.19 billion, beating analyst estimates of $1.07 billion.
FUTURE INVESTMENTS
The San Francisco-based company now expects headcount and total costs and expenses to grow at least 30% for the full year, up from its previous guidance of 25%, as it invests in its engineering and product teams.
Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, a longtime proponent of bitcoin, said during the earnings call the digital currency ""is a big part"" of Twitter's future and could be used for ecommerce transactions on the platform or to tip popular content creators.
Twitter added that new privacy controls that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) implemented in April, which are designed to limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent, had a lower-than-expected impact on revenue in the second quarter.
The full impact of Apple's changes have yet to be seen, and some concerns still linger, Arounian said.

Twitter forecast third quarter total revenue to be between $1.22 billion to $1.3 billion, roughly in line with or slightly ahead of consensus analyst estimates of $1.17 billion.
On an adjusted basis, Twitter earned 20 cents per share during the second quarter, well above the estimate of 7 cents.

The legislation introduced by Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Lujan requires internet platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to take down health and vaccine-related misinformation during public health emergencies or be held liable for that failure. 
It also directs the Department of Health & Human Services to issue guidelines on what constitutes health misinformation. 
""These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,"" Klobuchar said.
The bill quotes a study from the Center for Countering Digital Hate that found social media platforms failed to act on 95% of coronavirus-related disinformation reported to them.
Kevin Martin, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said the company supports reforming Section 230.
""We believe clarification on the difficult and urgent questions about health related misinformation would be helpful and look forward to working with Congress and the industry as we consider options for reform."" 
The Health Misinformation Act is not the first bill targeting tech firms' liability shield from Senator Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee.
Earlier this year, she co-sponsored another bill called the Safe Tech Act with two fellow Democrats. It aims to make social media companies more accountable for enabling cyber-stalking, targeted harassment and discrimination on their platforms. 
The chief executives of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Facebook have said Section 230 is crucial to free expression on the internet. They said it gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions that law needs moderate changes.
Several Republican lawmakers have separately pushed to scrap the law entirely over decisions by tech platforms to moderate content critical of former President Donald Trump and his supporters.

There are several other pieces of legislation aimed at changing the law that have been making the rounds for over a year, including a bipartisan bill from Democrat Brian Schatz and Republican John Thune.
Trump repeatedly pushed for the legal protection to be stripped away over what he alleged was censorship against conservatives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. agency said on Thursday it is permitting three airports to enter into security agreements with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Air unit that will allow the company to assume some security functions and facilitate Amazon's rapid planned hiring at the airports.
In a notice, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said Cincinnati/Northern, Baltimore/Washington (BWI), and Chicago Rockford can enter into agreements allowing Amazon Air to assume some security functions. 
The agreements are typically used when an entire airport terminal is serviced exclusively by one aircraft operator. The exemption will allow Amazon to assume physical control of some airport access and ""initiate the employee vetting functions that the airport authorities would otherwise be required to conduct"" as well as handle ID issues.
""Amazon Air possesses the latest, sophisticated access control and monitoring systems that enhance security by significantly restricting access to cargo and aircraft,"" TSA said.
Amazon did not immediately comment.
TSA said the exemptions will ""facilitate the rapid hiring of significant numbers of new personnel to support Amazon Air’s expanded presence at these locations, aiding the economy in the surrounding areas.""
A TSA spokesman said the agreements hold Amazon Air ""to the same TSA-regulated security standards that airport and aircraft operators adhere to in their operations.""
TSA typically allows airports to enter only into what are known as Exclusive Area Agreements with aircraft operators or foreign air carriers.
TSA said Amazon Air ""has represented to TSA that it intends to hire significantly more employees over the next 12 to 18 months"" at the airports.

Amazon Air maintains operations at numerous domestic and international airports and owns air cargo aircraft, but does not operate the aircraft itself and is not an aircraft operator under TSA regulations, the agency said.
""Amazon Air benefits from ample resources to purchase advanced equipment as needed, without regard to local government budget restrictions that many airports face,"" TSA said.

(Reuters) -Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said on Thursday it still faces supply chain constraints and gave an annual sales forecast that implied a weak end of the year.
The 2021 forecast of $73.5 billion in adjusted sales was higher than Wall Street expectations, appeared driven by a strong second quarter ended June 26 and a modestly better-than-expected third-quarter, implying a weak fourth quarter. The results sent shares down 2.8% in after-hours trading after the results.
Intel, one of the few remaining companies in the processor chip industry that both designs and manufactures its own chips, has been able to weather the supply chain woes better than some rivals and is also working to build a business of making chips for others, called a ""foundry"" business. 
Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger declined to comment on a recent report that Intel is looking to buy GlobalFoundries for $30 billion to bolster its foundry efforts but told Reuters that he expects industry consolidation to continue and that ""M&A will remain a part of our strategy"" for building the company's foundry business.
Intel raised its previous annual forecast $1 billion from its earlier $72.5 billion and beat expectations of $72.80 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Intel expects adjusted third-quarter revenue of about $18.2 billion, only modestly above estimates of $18.09 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
""I think investors simply expect more from semiconductor companies in this environment,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones ""Even though they did increase revenue guidance, it was only about a 1% increase. A bulk of the change in earnings guidance was due to a lower tax rate.""
Gelsinger said Intel could sell more chips if it could make more chips. Even though the company runs its own factories, it still faces supply constraints from its own suppliers of materials and equipment.
""We are helping them build factories as fast as they can,"" Gelsinger told Reuters. ""But it will be one of those things that just takes a couple years to fully catch up to this explosive demand we’re seeing, and we have better tools to address it than others.""
But some analysts do not agree with Intel's rosy view of end demand. Citing a tame forecast this week from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc, Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, disputed Gelsinger's view of the market and said Intel was likely to keep ""playing defense"" against rivals like AMD with better chips.
""We think the entire semiconductor supply chain will be caught up by 4Q21 as we believe there's rampant double ordering in the supply chain coupled with a moderating end-market demand,"" Chan said.
For the just-ended second quarter, Intel reported $18.5 billion in adjusted sales, well above analyst estimates of $17.80 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Taking the second and third quarter into account, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said that Intel's slightly higher full-year forecast implied a shortfall in fourth-quarter sales versus previous forecasts - despite the fourth-quarter usually being one of the company's best quarters as consumers snap up laptops and PCs as holiday gifts. Intel did disclose that a one-time charge of $300 million will hit the fourth quarter, saying it was related to its business of selling supercomputers to the federal government.
Gelsinger, however, told investors on a conference call that he expects the PC market to keep growing into 2022, contradicting the predictions of some analysts. 

Revenue from the company's higher-margin data center business fell 9% to $6.5 billion in the second quarter, while its personal computing business revenue rose 6%, both beating Refinitiv estimates.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter, compared with estimates of $1.06, according to Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stock markets closed higher after a mixed trading session as investors digested negative economic data reflecting the country's struggle to move past the COVID-19 pandemic, while yields on safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries slipped.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in the green and within 1% of record closing highs, thanks in part to Big Tech. The Dow and S&P 500 fell earlier in the day on the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits. The dollar also rose after it slid earlier in the trading session.
""The overall picture continues to point to a return to a pre-pandemic level of economic activity,"" said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst for Commonwealth Financial Network, in an e-mailed statement about the jobless claims and market impact. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.35 points, or 0.07%, to close at 34,823.35, the S&P 500 gained 8.79 points, or 0.20%, to end the day at 4,367.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.64 points, or 0.36%, to close at 14,684.60.
The dollar index, meanwhile, rose 0.1% to 92.852. The U.S. currency hit its highest level in more than three months on Wednesday.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries eased after the auction of $16 billion in 10-year TIPS was bid at a record low. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 2.2 basis points to 1.260%.
“We had a form of capitulation in the market, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Monday, but a sign of resilience occurred on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said Steve Goldman at Goldman Management. “That’s typically a favorable sign for a market not far from its high. That’s usually a hopeful sign. It tends to indicate that the selling pressure has subsided.” 
“The jobless claims data that came out this morning was soft and continues to be stubbornly elevated,” said Sean Bandazian, investment analyst for Cornerstone Wealth. “The market is probably digesting some volatility from the last several days. We had a pretty sizable drawdown and then recovery making back 75% of what we lost Friday and Monday.” 
Growth stocks were back in favor, closing up, while value stocks slipped. Earnings season marched on, with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) falling in extended trade after posting results and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co reporting a loss. 
There were increases in filings for unemployment benefits in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Texas. Some of these states have experienced a surge in new coronavirus cases as the more contagious Delta variant spreads, while U.S. senators try to take aim at tech companies allowing misinformation about vaccines to spread.
Still, the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department showed more people are returning to work, a trend that bodes well for July's employment report.
Earlier this week, a revived appetite for riskier assets came as worries eased that the Delta variant of COVID-19 would seriously crimp economic recovery, helping to lift crude oil prices.
OIL FIRMS
Oil prices rose about $1.50 a barrel on Thursday, extending strong gains made in the previous sessions on expectations of tighter supplies until the end of the year as economies recover from the pandemic.
U.S. crude recently was unchanged at $71.91 per barrel and Brent was at $73.62, up 1.92% on the day.[O/R]
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.42%.

Cryptocurrencies were firm after bouncing from lows when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk said the carmaker would likely restart accepting bitcoin payments after due diligence on its energy use.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big tech helped Wall Street inch up to a higher close on Thursday, modestly building on a two-day rally as lackluster economic data and mixed corporate earnings prompted a pivot back to growth stocks.
A pull-back in economically sensitive cyclicals kept the S&P 500's and the blue-chip Dow's gains muted, while small-caps underperformed their larger rivals.
But megacap tech and tech-adjacent stocks, such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, rose ahead of their quarterly results next week, putting the Nasdaq out front.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session within 1% of their record closing highs.
Growth stocks, which outperformed throughout the health crisis, were back in favor, gaining 0.8%, while the value index slipped by 0.5%.
""The market is flip-flopping between the view that economic growth has almost peaked so you need to buy stocks that manufacture their own growth like tech names, versus the view that economic growth will continue and you want to own cyclicals and value names,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
The number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits spiked unexpectedly to 419,000 last week, a two-month high, according to the Labor Department.
Market participants are closely watching labor market indicators for hints as to when the Federal Reserve, expected to convene next week for its two-day monetary policy meeting, will begin discussions about hiking key interest rates from near zero.
""The jobless data today didn’t have a meaningful impact on markets or the economic outlook,"" Carter added. ""It’s now all about how much longer the Fed will tolerate low rates. The Fed seems to be favoring its full employment mandate more than its price stability mandate."" 
""Accordingly, the upcoming Fed meeting could be impactful,"" Carter said.
Benchmark Treasury yields eased after the bid at the largest-ever TIPS auction touched a record low, pressuring rate sensitive banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.35 points, or 0.07%, to 34,823.35, the S&P 500 gained 8.79 points, or 0.20%, to 4,367.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.64 points, or 0.36%, to 14,684.60.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, tech was shining brightest, gaining 0.7%. Energy stocks suffered the largest percentage drop.
The second-quarter reporting season barreled ahead at full-throttle, with 104 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 88% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Drugmaker Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) gained 1.1% after hiking its full-year revenue guidance, while Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc surged 14.6% to an all-time high on the heels of its quarterly report.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, sending its stock down 3.5%, and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc dipped 1.1% even after reporting a quarterly profit.
The S&P 1500 Airlines index ended the session off 1.7%. 
Shares of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc slid 5.3% after its current-quarter revenue forecast cast concerns as to whether the company will be able to meet spiking demand in the face of a global semiconductor shortage. 
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index ended the session down 0.9%.
Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) slipped more than 1% in extended trading after the chipmaker posted results and raised its annual revenue forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 54 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.25 billion shares, compared with the 10.12 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

LONDON (Reuters) - REE Automotive, which received shareholder approval for a reverse merger with special acquisition company 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp on Thursday, plans to launch production of an electric delivery van and a people mover in 2023, the company's top executive said.
Chief Executive Daniel Barel said the company does not have a specific number of orders - a number of electric van startups have announced large orders - but said REE's strength lies in its partnerships. 
The company is scheduled to begin trading under the ""REE"" symbol on Friday.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp unit Hino will use Tel Aviv-based REE's platform for its electric trucks and buses, and REE has also formed partnerships with American Axle (NYSE:AXL), Canadian auto supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), French autonomous shuttle maker Navya and EAVX, a newly-formed unit of U.S. commercial vehicle body maker JP Poindexter & Co. 
REE's electric chassis will be used for a variety of different vehicles that will have their own branding. 
""All these companies at some point are going to start using us as their platform,"" Barel said. ""We're literally everywhere now, so that's far larger than just one order.""
As battery prices come down and large companies face pressure to switch to zero-emission delivery vehicles, the outlook for electric vans and trucks is good.
But as traditional manufacturers are gearing up to launch their own electric vans, the race is on for startups to bring scale up and bring their products to market.

Instead of traditional axles, REE's electric vehicle platform runs using four separate wheels - with their own steering, braking, suspension, powertrain and control - that allow its vehicles to have flatter bottoms, providing more room for cargo. 
The company has a customizable order book allowing customers to choose different weight classes, battery range, height and width.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shareholders in British supermarket group Morrisons will vote next month on a 6.3 billion pound ($8.7 billion) agreed takeover offer from a consortium led by the SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group.
A scheme document outlining Fortress' offer, published on Thursday, said a court meeting and a general meeting of shareholders would be held on Aug. 16 at Morrisons' headquarters in Bradford, northern England, and online.
To go through, the offer needs the support of shareholders representing at least 75% in value of voting shareholders at the meeting.
The Fortress offer is worth 254 pence a share, made up of 252 pence in cash and a 2 pence a share special dividend.
Morrisons - Britain's fourth largest supermarket group after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda - aims to have the takeover become effective on Aug. 26, with the special dividend paid two weeks later.
Shares in Morrisons closed at 268 pence on Thursday.
The offer from Fortress, along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments, exceeded a 5.52 billion pound unsolicited proposal from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which Morrisons rejected in June.
CD&R could still make a higher offer. Analysts have speculated that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could also enter the fray.
Britain's Takeover Panel, which regulates corporate transactions, said on Thursday it had given CD&R until Aug. 9 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or walk away -- a so-called ""put-up or shut-up"" order.
A third private equity suitor Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) said on Tuesday it would not pursue a solo offer for Morrisons but could join the Fortress consortium.
The scheme document showed that Fortress expected to incur banking and advisory fees and expenses of 263.5 million pounds, while Morrisons expected to incur up to 49.6 million pounds.
Morrisons said it and Fortress were also in talks with the trustees of Morrisons' pension schemes.
It said Fortress had confirmed it appreciated the importance of the schemes as key stakeholders and that it recognised the need to maintain support currently provided to them and that this required mitigation.

Talks are continuing with the trustees to agree mitigation and the trustees will issue their opinion on the Fortress offer in due course, Morrisons said.

Then Buy These 3 Stocks Now,"Rising demand from the industrial and renewable energy sectors should keep driving copper prices higher. As such, established copper miners Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Vale S.A. (VALE), and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) should be significant beneficiaries. Read on.Copper prices hit $4.50 per pound on April 29, the highest price in more than a decade. The rising demand for copper amid rising manufacturing and industrial activities and a global supply crunch has resulted in a 17% increase in copper prices in the first half of 2021, through June 17.
Given copper’s broad applications in electric vehicle (EV) production and the sustainable energy industry, the demand for copper is expected to remain high over the long term. However, underinvestment in the commodity has resulted in a supply crunch. According to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), copper is expected to exceed $20,000 a ton by 2024, with copper inventories currently hovering levels akin to 15 years ago.
Given this backdrop, we believe leading copper mining stocks Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Vale S.A. ADR (VALE), and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) should deliver significant returns in the near term.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week added a warning to its fact sheet for J&J's single-shot vaccine saying that data suggests there is an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the six weeks after vaccination. 
The CDC advisory panel evaluated the J&J vaccine's risks and benefits after these preliminary reports of GBS from people who have gotten the shot. 
Given the possible association between GBS and the vaccine, CDC will update its considerations for the use of J&J's vaccine to say that patients with a history of GBS should first look at the availability of two-shot mRNA-based vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), an agency official said. 
The FDA cited 100 preliminary reports of GBS in J&J vaccine recipients including 95 serious cases that required hospitalization and one reported death.
J&J on Thursday said the known benefits on its vaccine outweigh known potential risks. 

Members of a work group of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expressed ""strong support"" for continued use of J&J vaccine, the CDC's Sarah Mbaeyi said during the panel meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) plans to invest more than 40 billion euros ($47 billion) by 2030 to be ready to take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in an all-electric car market, but warned the shift in technology would lead to job cuts.
Outlining its strategy for an electric future, the inventor of the modern motor car said on Thursday it would, with partners, build eight battery plants as it ramps up electric vehicle (EV) production.
From 2025, all new vehicle platforms will only make EVs, the German luxury automaker added.
""We really want to go for it ... and be dominantly, if not all electric, by the end of the decade,"" Chief Executive Ola Källenius told Reuters, adding that spending on traditional combustion-engine technology would be ""close to zero"" by 2025.
However, Daimler - to be renamed Mercedes-Benz as part of plans to spin off its trucks division later this year - stopped short of giving a hard deadline for ending sales of fossil-fuel cars.
Some carmakers like Geely-owned Volvo Cars have committed to going all electric by 2030, while General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) says it aspires to be fully electric by 2035, as they all try to close the gap to industry leader Tesla.
""We need to move the debate away from when you build the last combustion engine because it's not relevant,"" Källenius said. ""The question is how quickly can you scale up to being close to 100% electric and that's what we're focusing on.""
Daimler shares rose as much as 2.5% after the news, which comes just over a week after the European Union proposed an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035 as part of a broad package of measures to combat global warming.
Ahead of the EU's announcement, carmakers had announced a series of major investments in EVs. Earlier this month, Stellantis said it would invest more than 30 billion euros by 2025 on electrifying its line-up.
TOUGH DECISIONS
At Mercedes-Benz, the shift will see an 80% drop in investments into combustion engines and plug-in hybrid technologies between 2019 and 2026, which the group said would have a direct impact on jobs.
EVs have fewer components and so require fewer workers than combustion engine vehicles.
""A transformation of our workforce will involve tough decisions. Yes, overall we must and will reduce our personal costs,"" Mercedes-Benz management board member and head of human resources Sabine Kohleisen said.
Daimler said that as of 2025, it expects electric and hybrid electric cars will make up 50% of sales - with all-electric cars expected to account for most of that - earlier than its previous forecast that this would happen by 2030.
The carmaker will unveil three electric platforms - one to cover its range of passenger cars and SUVs, one for vans and one for high-performance vehicles - that will be launched in 2025.
Daimler is also acquiring British firm YASA Limited to help develop high-performance electric motors.
The company said it would build out 200 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cell capacity. Four of its new battery plants will be in Europe and one in the United States.
Daimler said it would announce new European partners for its battery production plans soon.
The EU has been pushing hard to build out battery capacity to counter China's dominance of battery production. 

Rival Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe. 
Daimler said that as part of its electrification strategy it would build a battery recycling plant in Kuppenheim, Germany, which would start operations in 2023. ($1 = 0.8481 euros)

(Reuters) -Endo International Plc has agreed to pay $35 million to settle a lawsuit by Tennessee local governments and on behalf of a child allegedly born addicted to painkillers accusing the drugmaker of fueling the opioid epidemic, the company announced Thursday.
The settlement came just days before the case was set to go to trial to decide damages, in which plaintiffs were expected to seek $2.4 billion. A judge had previously ruled Endo liable as a penalty for failing to hand over evidence.
""We are pleased that after four-plus years of litigation that we have been able to reach an agreement in principle with Endo, and are grateful to the communities of northeast Tennessee for their support in this landmark prosecution,"" said Gerard Stranch, a lawyer at Branstetter, Stranch & Jennings, who represented the plaintiffs.
The deal must still be approved by some of the plaintiffs, Endo said. 
Endo shares had jumped about 25% on Tuesday after local government officials revealed that the drugmaker had made a settlement offer.
The lawsuit, which was filed in 2017, is being pursued by nine counties, 18 cities and a ""Baby Doe"" allegedly born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is caused by withdrawal after in-utero opioid exposure.
The plaintiffs alleged that Endo downplayed the risks of its painkiller Opana ER, which was pulled from the market in 2017 due to concerns about abuse. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and generic opioid maker  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) Plc were also named as defendants in the case, but subsequently filed for bankruptcy, leaving Endo as the only active defendant.
Chancellor E.G. Moody of the Circuit Court for Sullivan County, who is overseeing the case, ruled in April that Endo and its lawyers engaged in a ""coordinated strategy"" to withhold evidence, including about opioid prescribers. He took the unusual step of entering judgment of liability against the company as a sanction, leaving only damages to be decided at trial.
Nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC last week said provisional data showed that 2020 was a record year for overall drug overdose deaths with 93,331, up 29% from a year earlier.
The Tennessee case is among the more than 3,000 lawsuits, mostly by local governments, accusing drugmakers of falsely promoting opioids as safe and distributors and pharmacies of overlooking red flags that drugs were being diverted to illegal channels. The defendants have denied the claims.

U.S. state attorneys general on Wednesday unveiled a settlement proposal in which leading drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp would pay a combined $21 billion, and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) would pay $5 billion, to resolve most claims against them.
Endo is not part of that deal, and is currently defending itself along with other drugmakers at trials in New York and California. The company in 2019 settled opioid claims by two Ohio counties for $10 million.

(Reuters) -Snap Inc on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for users and revenue in the second quarter, notching the highest growth rates since late 2017 as new features on its messaging app Snapchat attracted more users.
Shares of Santa Monica, California-based Snap (NYSE:SNAP) rose about 10% to $69.20 in extended trading, after its forecast for the current quarter also came in above expectations.
Snapchat, known for its Stories feature that lets users post updates that disappear after 24 hours, has grown its app into five parts spanning media content and viral short-form video clips to keep users engaged and draw in more advertisers.
Daily active users rose 23% to 293 million during the quarter ended June 30, above analysts' estimates of 290.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. User growth beat the company's prior best of 22%. 
Snap's revenue jumped 116% to $982 million, well above the expectation of $845.9 million. Previously, its strongest growth rate was 66%.
The company continued to grow throughout the pandemic by promoting ad formats on Snapchat geared toward bringing in sales for advertisers, such as letting users swipe up on a mobile ad to go to the brand's website.
Snap forecast third-quarter revenue between $1.07 billion and $1.09 billion, and it expects daily active users to grow 21% to 301 million, both exceeding expectations. 
Analysts are expecting revenue of $1.01 billion and daily active users of 298.5 million. 
New privacy controls implemented by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in April, which were intended to limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their knowledge, caused ""some disruption"" to advertiser demand, said Snap's Chief Business Officer, Jeremi Gorman, in a statement.

However, it was too early to gauge the long-term impact on Snap's business, Gorman said. 
In order to help brands increase sales, Snap has also invested heavily in augmented reality technology for functions such as helping users virtually try on makeup or clothes.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Thursday, after recovering intraday weakness supported by a bid up technology stocks amid falling Treasury yields following data showing a surprise rise in weekly jobless claims.
The S&P 500 rose 0.21%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.07%, or 25 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.36%.
In the week ended July 17, initial jobless claims unexpectedly climbed by 51,000 to 419,000, a nine-week high, confounding economist estimates for a decline to 350,000. Still the move was largely brushed off by some economists, who see it as a one-off and expect the downward trend in claims to resume course.  
“At this point, we're inclined to believe that this is once again a ‘one-off’ situation with this week's back-up in claims as demand for labor remains extremely strong and there is nothing that stands out to us as a reason to have expected layoff activity to rebound. We will be looking for claims to resume their downward trend next week,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields were on the back foot following the data, though recovered some losses intraday. Banks were hit hard amid the stumble in yields, but technology racked up gains as lower yields make longer duration, or investments that have a longer payback period, attractive.
People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) and  Charles Schwab  Corp (NYSE:SCHW) were down more than 3%.
In large-cap tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was in the spotlight, hitting a fresh 52-week high as investors piled into the stock ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results slated for next week.
“We expect another ‘beat and raise’ special from Redmond with Azure growth numbers (45%+ YoY) that exceed whisper expectations and headline numbers that comfortably exceed the Street's $44 billion and $1.90 estimate,” Wedbush said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were higher.
Energy was also a source of pain for the broader market, down nearly 1%, shrugging off rising oil prices amid weakness in  Cabot Oil & Gas  Corporation (NYSE:COG),  Baker Hughes  Co (NYSE:BKR) and  Valero Energy  Corporation (NYSE:VLO).
On the earnings front, Domino’s Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) jumped more than 14% after the pizza chain delivered quarterly results that topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines, driven by its new menu items.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) fell 3% as better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by ongoing threat that rising Covid infections pose to travel demand."

107,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>","AT&T raises forecast for revenue, HBO Max as business recovers from pandemic","By Sheila Dang and Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -AT&T Inc on Thursday raised its full-year financial forecast as the telecoms company emerged from the pandemic with more wireless and internet customers, and beat analyst estimates for phone subscribers and revenue in the second quarter.
The results come as AT&T (NYSE:T) is unwinding its expensive media investments to focus on its original business of providing phone and internet services. 
Ahead of closing a deal to combine its media content with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), AT&T said WarnerMedia continued to attract more customers to streaming service HBO Max and notched higher revenue as live sports and televised events resumed from the pandemic.
The company added 789,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the quarter ended June 30, blowing past Wall Street estimates of 278,000 new subscribers, according to data from research firm FactSet.
WarnerMedia added 2.8 million U.S. subscribers for its premium channel HBO and streaming platform HBO Max during the quarter, thanks to new movies like Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights"" and ""Mortal Kombat,"" which is based on the popular video game.
The growth of new digital video subscribers is one sign the market for streaming media is still expanding in the United States, said WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar in an interview, even as streaming pioneer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported losing 430,000 subscribers in the United States and Canada in the second quarter.
""The market is expanding based on consumer spending ... but you have to deliver for customers day in and day out,"" he said.
Kilar added that HBO Max subscriber growth in Latin America is going to exceed the absolute number of subscriber additions in the U.S. market over the back half of this year and that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if that trend persists into 2022.
The company’s Warner Bros. studio is producing over ten motion pictures that will be available exclusively on HBO Max on “day one” in 2022, Kilar said. 
The company said during a conference call with analysts that it would delay launching HBO Max in some European markets until early 2022 in order to focus on its early success in Latin America.
AT&T raised its forecast for global HBO Max subscribers to between 70 million and 73 million by the end of the year. It previously expected 67 million to 70 million subscribers. 
Still, AT&T's move to exit the entertainment business reflects the enormous costs and challenges to compete in a crowded streaming video industry.
Globally, HBO and HBO Max now have 67.5 million subscribers, compared with 209 million subscribers for Netflix.
'STRONG EXIT VELOCITY'
The Dallas-based company said its deal to sell a minority stake in DirecTV, its struggling satellite TV brand that continued to shed customers during the quarter, to buyout firm TPG Capital is expected to close within the next few weeks.
AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said the company's commitment to WarnerMedia and DirecTV have remained the same to set the businesses up for success.
""We want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands their respective opportunities for success,"" he said during the conference call.
If the deal to sell a piece of DirecTV closes in a few weeks, total revenue will be lowered by $9 billion for the remainder of the year, the company said.
On Wednesday, the company announced it would sell Vrio Corp, its DirecTV business unit in Latin America, to Argentina-based investment group Grupo Werthein after taking a $4.6 billion impairment charge. 
AT&T added 246,000 net new fiber internet subscribers during the quarter, up from 225,000 added in the year-ago quarter, as the company has made it a top business priority to serve more households with high-speed internet through fiber optic cables.
Total revenue at AT&T rose 7.6% to $44 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $42.67 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding impacts from the DirecTV and TPG deal, AT&T now expects 2021 revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range and adjusted earnings per share to rise in the low- to mid-single digits.
The company had previously guided revenue growth in the 1% range and adjusted earnings per share to be stable with the previous year.
Net income attributable to common stock rose to $1.5 billion, or 21 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $1.2 billion, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Excluding items, AT&T earned 89 cents per share, above estimates of 79 cents. 
Shares of AT&T were flat in morning trading.

Investing.com -- The market’s two-day climb back from Monday’s rout took a pause on Thursday after an unexpectedly large jump in new jobless claims in the most recent week. The S&P 500 inched higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was basically flat heading into the last half-hour of trading.
For the week ended Saturday, claims reached a nine-week high of 419,000 against expectations for filings of 350,000. Still the move was largely brushed off by some economists, who expect the downward trend in claims to resume.  
Bank stocks took a hit from a drop in bond yields, balanced by a runup in tech stocks. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)reached a 52-week high ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results slated for next week.
New menu items helped make Domino’s Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) one of the best performers of the day, jumping 13% on a positive earnings report.
It’s another quiet summer Friday on the data front, though earnings continue to pour out, setting up next week’s flurry of reports from big technology companies.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1.  American Express  profits
American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.63 on revenue of $9.55 billion for the second quarter, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Stronger consumer spending in the quarter is likely to be a trend, but analysts will also be listening to the outlook on small business spending and the economic rebound.
2. Honeywell earnings
Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON), the manufacturing and tech company, is seen posting second-quarter revenue of $8.65 billion and EPS of $1.94.
3.  Kimberly Clark  earnings
Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is likely to register a second-quarter EPS of $1.74 on revenue of $4.78 billion. The maker of Scott toilet paper and Huggies diapers said in March it would have to raise prices because of rising materials costs, and consumers were expected to see the increases at the register by the end of June.

(Reuters) -U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Thursday posted quarterly profits helped by a bookings rebound and federal aid and vowed to resolve hiccups across their operations as passengers return in droves.
Airlines quickly scaled back flying when the coronavirus gripped the industry in early 2020. Now they are rushing to return airplanes and workers to the skies as demand returns quicker than they had expected.
Both American and Southwest had to cancel summer flights due to labor shortages, bad weather and less network flexibility. Now they are recalling crews and resuming hiring.
""It's messy,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told investors and media.
He said the company is ""intensely focused"" on improving its operations and flagged the time it will take to hire and train new workers as a key concern going forward. 
""We are in the midst of an unprecedented recovery,"" American Chief Executive Doug Parker said on an investor call where the company also outlined plans to pay down about $15 billion of debt by the end of 2025.
U.S. airlines received $54 billion in COVID-19 relief for workers' salaries during the crisis, without which Parker said restoring operations would have been even harder because so many workers would have left the industry.
""I can't imagine how hectic it would be in terms of not just the airline industry but for our entire economy,"" he said.
Airlines have also been grappling with a rising number of unruly passengers on increasingly crowded airplanes, including thousands who have refused to wear masks. 
Domestic leisure travel has nearly recouped 2019 levels, and American said it sees domestic business travel fully recovering next year. Southwest said it is seeing a 5-point improvement in business bookings each month.
While international travel remains beset by entry bans, American said there is a ""quick and dramatic increase in bookings"" whenever restrictions are lifted. 
Revenues at American, the world's largest airline, jumped 361% to $7.48 billion, beating forecasts, as it carried 44 million passengers, five times more than a year ago.
Total operating revenue at Southwest, which is more focused on domestic travel, rose nearly 300% to $4 billion from a year earlier but fell about 32% from 2019.
More flying and higher fuel prices will weigh on the airline's costs in the third quarter, it warned.
Southwest shares lost 3.5% in late trading and American stock lost 1.5% tracking U.S. airline index losses after two days of gains. 
American, the world's largest carrier, turned a $19 million profit for the second quarter to June, including federal aid, compared with a loss of $2.07 billion, a year earlier.
Southwest posted net income of $348 million, or $0.57 per share, also including aid. Excluding items, Southwest's net loss was larger than analysts had forecast.
However, both airlines said they were profitable in the month of June even without federal funds, a first since the pandemic began in early 2020.
 Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group on Thursday reported a $397 million profit, or $3.15 per share, in the second quarter, including aid.

Executives from the three airlines said they have not seen any impact from the rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus, echoing recent comments by rivals Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines. 
United's CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) warned, however, of ""ups and downs"" until more people are vaccinated against the virus.

Below, we provide a look at three of the most oversold tech stocks you should consider adding to your portfolio: Micron Technology (MU), McAfee (MCFE), and Trimble (TRMB).
MU is one of the top global providers of memory solutions for semiconductors. MU makes memory and storage tech such as DRAM, short for dynamic random access memory.

Furthermore, the resumption of infrastructure activities with the reopening of the economy should boost the growth of infrastructure companies. As such, we think CRH (NYSE:CRH) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) should both benefit from the industry tailwinds. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, CRH plc (CRH) manufactures and distributes building materials through its subsidiaries. It operates in three segments: Americas Materials, Europe Materials, and Building Products. The company manufactures and supplies cement, lime, aggregates, precast, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt products. In comparison, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM) in Raleigh, N.C. is a natural resource-based building materials company that supplies aggregates and heavy-side building materials to the construction industry internationally. In addition, it offers crushed stone, sand, and gravel products. The company also manufactures dolomitic lime primarily for customers in the steel and mining industries.
Infrastructure-related activities such as repairing roads, bridges, and ports are expected to go up significantly with the reopening of the economy, driving near-term growth for companies in this space. Moreover, President Biden expects a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill moving ahead on Monday. The passage of this bill would create many opportunities for infrastructure companies to grow in the long run.
MLM has gained 24.1% year-to-date, while CRH returned 14.7%. Also, MLM’s 37.6% gain over the past nine months is significantly higher than CRH’s 30.1% returns. Moreover, in terms of past years’ performance, MLM is the clear winner with 56.2% gains versus CRH’s 26.2% returns.

It seems that silver is trading like inflation will be transitory. Taylor Dart explains why silver needs to rally soon.While the S&P-500 (SPY) has easily shrugged off its mid-month weakness, the precious metals have been unable to reverse course, continuing to hover near their recent lows, with silver (SLV) slightly weaker than gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)). This underperformance continues to weigh on sentiment for the precious metals, with bullish sentiment for silver plunging to nearly 20%, an area where we have seen buyers step up in the past. The slightly negative development, though, is that this recent weakness is beginning to weigh on the gold/silver ratio, and we do not want to see this ratio climb above 80, which would be a change of character. Given that silver continues to remain above its yearly breakout with no breakout yet in the gold/silver ratio, I continue to remain bullish. Let's take a closer look at the bull and bear case below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author's Chart)
As shown in the chart above, bullish sentiment for silver has slid significantly from February levels, down from a reading of 90% bulls when a herd of investors was briefly convinced that WallStreetBets was going to corner the silver market. Given the Hunt Brothers' lack of success in this same endeavor, it should have been quite obvious this wasn't likely to work, and the price has retreated considerably since. The good news is that this 18% correction in SLV has taken a massive bite out of sentiment, with bullish sentiment falling 6500 basis points in 4 months, from 90% bulls to barely 20% bulls. While low readings on sentiment do not guarantee bottoms, they do create the conditions for bottoms to be formed, and we typically see buying support on any further weakness. This suggests that sentiment has finally tilted in favor of the bulls, and we have entered a low-risk buy zone for a starter position in silver.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. life sciences company Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s proposed acquisition of cancer test maker Grail Inc could curb innovation and competition, EU antitrust regulators warned Thursday as they opened a full-scale investigation. 
The European Commission's announcement confirmed a Reuters story last week.
Illumina announced the $8 billion cash-and-stock deal for startup Grail last September, buying out investors including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, to regain control of a company it spun out five years ago.
Grail makes a non-invasive, early detection biopsy test to screen for many kinds of cancers using DNA sequencing.
The EU executive, which acts as the competition enforcer for the 27-country bloc, said its preliminary investigation showed that Illumina could have an economic incentive to block Grail's cancer detection rivals.
""It is very important to preserve market conditions, allowing the best solutions to emerge for the tests to ultimately reach the market at affordable prices,"" Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The EU watchdog will decide by Nov. 29 whether to clear or block the deal.
Illumina said it will work with the Commission but warned against a veto of the deal.
""Re-uniting GRAIL with Illumina will accelerate availability of the GRAIL test by many years in the EEA and globally, saving tens of thousands of lives, and leading to significant health care cost savings,"" said CEO Francis deSouza in a statement.
In Washington, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint seeking to block the deal, arguing that Illumina is the sole provider of the DNA sequencing that Grail uses and could prevent others from entering the market.
To address antitrust concerns, deSouza told Reuters on Thursday that Illumina had offered a 12-year contract to supply its technology to potential rivals.
He also argued that Illumina was best placed to broadly market the test. ""This is all about access,"" he said of the proposed deal. ""This will be a test for the rich otherwise, for a while.""
The deal will face an August trial at the FTC.

While seeking EU approval for the deal, Illumina is also challenging in court the EU decision to examine it even though it does not meet the revenue criteria. Regulators say such powers are necessary to prevent companies buying rival start-ups to close them down.
Critics however say it creates uncertainties for companies.

One, to lead us in monetary policy, and the second, in regulating the largest financial institutions,” Warren told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I have asked the chairman repeatedly from the time he was nominated about his views on regulation. I am concerned when I see the rules weakened rather than strengthened.”
The remarks follow a hearing last week when Warren, a vocal proponent of tougher banking rules, laid out a laundry list of grievances as Powell appeared before the Senate Banking Committee.
The committee’s chairman, Sherrod Brown, said Thursday he’s undecided whether he would support a second term for Powell as Fed chair. Like Warren, Brown said he was dissatisfied with Powell’s approach to regulation.
Powell, whose term as chairman runs through February, enjoys broad support for his renomination among top White House advisers, though the decision is expected later this year and hasn’t yet been put in front of Biden, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
Even though many Democratic lawmakers have publicly complimented Powell’s leadership of the central bank, if prominent Democratic senators are opposed, or even lukewarm, it could spell trouble for his renomination for a second four-year term.

""We have implemented a fix for this issue, and based on current observations, the service is resuming normal operations,"" Akamai said in a tweet.
The disruption lasted up to an hour and was caused by a bug in the domain name system (DNS) service, which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations, that was triggered during a software update, Akamai said.
Services resumed after rolling back the update, Akamai added, and confirmed the disruption was not due to a cyberattack.
""We are reviewing our software update process to prevent future disruptions.""
Websites of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) were initially down, displaying domain name system (DNS) service errors.
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS said the global issue related to Akamai's network impacted access to many internet resources, including their own cloud services.
Both Oracle and Amazon said their services were operating normally shortly after.
DNS is a service that lets users connect to websites on their phone or laptop, where a domain name is used to reach a cloud network to load content through an Internet Protocol (IP) address. 
In June, multiple outages hit social media, government and news websites across the globe, with some reports pointing to a glitch at U.S.-based cloud computing service providers.

Thousands of users reported issues with websites of Airbnb, Home Depot,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), according to outage tracking website Downdetector on Thursday. 
Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, said users reported issues with 48 services, mostly within the United States.

And despite investors’ concerns that the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant could foster market volatility, Wall Street analysts expect specialty retail stocks Petco Health and Wellness (WOOF), KAR Auction Services (KAR), and Conn's (NASDAQ:CONN) to rally in the near term. Read on.The specialty retail industry has registered significant growth in the last two quarters, driven by the faster-than-expected macroeconomic recovery. Rapid job growth and federal stimulus checks have buoyed consumer spending, allowing specialty retail companies to generate a significant improvement in their profit margins.
Approximately $400 billion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed since the American Rescue Plan Act was signed in March. Furthermore, $1.60 billion in fiscal stimulus checks were distributed in the last tranche over the six weeks ended June 21. While weekly unemployment claims rose slightly for the week ended July 17, continuing claims reached a fresh pandemic low of 3.24 million on July 22, indicating a solid job market.
Despite rising concerns regarding the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, the U.S. economic recovery is expected to remain on track, given the substantial pent-up demand and savings accumulated during the worst days of the pandemic. Furthermore, with consumer spending accounting for 70% of the U.S. economy, the retail industry should continue growing despite the current market volatility.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>","NMC founder sues EY, banks and execs for $8 billion over alleged fraud","By Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - B.R. Shetty, the founder of stricken UAE hospital operator NMC Health, has sued auditor EY, two former top executives of his companies and two banks in a U.S. court, seeking $8 billion in damages for an alleged multibillion-dollar fraud at his group.
EY said in a statement: ""We believe this case is without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.""
Several companies linked to the Indian entrepreneur ran into trouble last year after short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) questioned NMC's financial statements. 
NMC subsequently announced far higher debts than it had previously reported and was later put into administration.
Shetty, now in India, is himself facing a criminal complaint in Abu Dhabi from one of NMC's lenders, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, and fighting court cases in India and Dubai as banks seek to recover loans from his companies. Last year, the UAE central bank ordered banks to freeze accounts of Shetty and members of his family, sources told Reuters.
Shetty has denied wrongdoing and says that he has been the victim of fraud.
In October, Shetty filed a complaint with Indian federal investigators, accusing brothers Prasanth and Promoth Manghat - respectively the former CEOs of NMC and Finablr, another Shetty group company -, along with their associates and bankers, of inflating the companies' balance sheets, arranging ""illegal"" credit facilities and misappropriating funds since 2012.
In the case filed last week at a U.S. Supreme Court in New York, Shetty repeated his allegations against the Manghat brothers and also said EY had issued fraudulent audits and financial reports while being aware of the laundering of illegally obtained loan proceeds. 
""EY actively and intentionally conspired with the defendants to conceal their fraudulent conduct,"" Shetty said, according to a copy of the 105-page filing seen by Reuters. 
He also alleged India's Bank of Baroda, through its New York and UAE branches, was a ""principal conduit"" for the fraudulent transactions, and Credit Europe Bank (CEB) in the Netherlands continued lending and earning fees despite being aware of the fraud.
A spokesperson for the Manghat brothers, who have denied Shetty's allegations, did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.
Bank of Baroda did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside of regular business hours. 

CEB said in a statement that Shetty's allegations had ""no legal or factual merit.""
Shetty said in the court filing he had been ""financially devastated"" by the alleged fraud and that it had cost him more than $7 billion, while drugmaker Neopharma, in which he owns a 49% stake, had suffered more than $1 billion in damages.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 inched higher Thursday,  as technology stocks received a boost from falling Treasury yields following data showing a surprise rise in weekly jobless claims.
The S&P 500 rose 0.17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.08%, or 26 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.30%.
In the week ended July 17, initial jobless claims unexpectedly climbed by 51,000 to 419,000, a nine-week high, confounding economist estimates for a decline to 350,000. Still the move was largely brushed off by some economists, who see it as a one-off and expect the downward trend in claims to resume course.  
“At this point, we're inclined to believe that this is once again a ‘one-off’ situation with this week's back-up in claims as demand for labor remains extremely strong and there is nothing that stands out to us as a reason to have expected layoff activity to rebound. We will be looking for claims to resume their downward trend next week,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields were on the back foot following the data, though recovered some losses intraday. Banks were hit hard amid the stumble yields, but technology racked up gains as lower yields make longer duration, or investments that have a longer payback period attractive.
People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) and  Charles Schwab  Corp (NYSE:SCHW) were down more than 3%.
In large-cap tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was in the spotlight, hitting a fresh 52-week high as investors pile into the stock ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results slated for next week.
“We expect another ‘beat and raise’ special from Redmond with Azure growth numbers (45%+ YoY) that exceed whisper expectations and headline numbers that comfortably exceed the Street's $44 billion and $1.90 estimate,” Wedbush said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were higher.
Energy was also a source of pain for the broader market, down nearly 1%, shrugging off rising oil prices amid weakness in  Cabot Oil & Gas  Corporation (NYSE:COG),  Baker Hughes  Co (NYSE:BKR) and  Valero Energy  Corporation (NYSE:VLO).
On the earnings front, Domino’s Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) jumped more than 14% after the pizza chain delivered quarterly results that topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines, driven by its new menu items.

(Reuters) -Largest U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc said on Thursday it expected current-quarter orders to be even lower than the third quarter as it limits new bookings amid a slowdown in homebuilding due to high material and labor costs.
Shares of the company were down nearly 3% in afternoon trading as third-quarter orders, an indicator of future revenue, fell 17% and missed estimates.
""Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders,"" Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheat said on a call with analysts.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which boosted the U.S. housing market with people seeking spacious accommodations while working from home, also disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials.
That led to a jump in material costs and permits for future home construction in the United States to decline to an eight-month low in June. 
Horton's quarterly orders were 17,952 units in the third quarter, while analysts were expecting 22,694 units. 
""We expect the stock to come under pressure given the magnitude of the order miss as no investors we have spoken with expected declines this severe,"" Michael Dahl, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note.

Horton expects full-year revenue between $27.6 billion and $28.1 billion, marginally above estimates.
Its third-quarter profit jumped 77% to $1.12 billion as it benefited from record-high property prices. Adjusted earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $7.28 billion topped estimates.

Also, since the shift to convenient and safe purchasing of essential food items is likely to persist, food retailers are expected to benefit. However, since the market is volatile currently, we think it would be wise to bet on food store retail stocks that pay dividends. So, high-dividend-yielding stocks Albertsons (ACI) and Weis Markets (WMK) could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.Food and grocery retail businesses have witnessed unprecedented changes over the past year, with a shift in consumer habits and lifestyle changes. While the economy's reopening this year is driving a revival in foot traffic in physical stores, the convenience of buying essential food items online and having them delivered at home continues to foster a dependence by consumers on digital stores.
As food retailers leverage both online and physical stores to drive sales, they are well-positioned to keep growing. Rising disposable income and affordability and increasing urbanization worldwide should contribute to the industry’s continued growth. Indeed, the global food and grocery retail market is expected to hit $17.3 trillion by 2027, growing at a 5% CAGR.
So, amid the current market volatility, we believe retail food store stocks Albertsons Company Inc. (ACI) and Weis Markets Inc. (WMK), which pay dividends, are attractive buys.

By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - U.S. hospitals that were expected to be early adopters of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug have treated only a handful of patients since its early June approval as they wait for the first payments from the government’s Medicare program for people aged 65 and older.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, called Aduhelm, based on limited evidence that it might slow a decline in cognitive function in people with the memory-robbing disease.
Some prominent doctors, hospitals and health insurers have criticized the FDA decision and said they will not offer the drug. The agency itself has invited an outside investigation into its decision-making process.
Other leading institutions, including in Michigan, Florida and Rhode Island, were eager to make the therapy available to patients in the hope it will provide a benefit, but told Reuters this week they are proceeding slowly while Medicare determines how it will cover Aduhelm, initially priced at about $56,000 per year.
Medicare has launched a nine-month process to set standardized national terms for Aduhelm coverage that may seek to limit its use.
For now, the government health plan is processing claims for the drug on a case-by-case basis. The first centers to use the drug as a commercial product said those claims have not yet been paid.
""Medicare does this very, very rarely for drugs and issues these coverage restrictions, again, very rarely,"" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Brigham and Women’s Hospital during an online interview presented jointly by The Forum at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Reuters. Kesselheim resigned as a member of the FDA advisory panel that reviewed Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s drug after the agency chose not to follow it recommendation against approval.
The slow uptake raises questions about the potential for 2021 sales for the treatment ahead of Biogen’s second-quarter earnings report on Thursday.
'BEING VERY CAUTIOUS'
The Michigan Institute for Neurological Disorders (MIND) said it has only treated one patient with Aduhelm.
Sonda Rossman, head of disease state initiatives, therapeutics, and clinical research at MIND, said the institute is testing more patients for Aduhelm eligibility, but is ""being very cautious"" about financial, as well as medical, risks.
Florida's First Choice Neurology and Butler Hospital's Memory and Aging Program in Providence, Rhode Island, have treated three patients each. Butler's program is run by Dr. Steven Salloway, an Aduhelm supporter who has called the drug's approval ""a turning point in Alzheimer’s research.""
The Mayo Clinic, which has partnered with Biogen to provide clinical testing to diagnose whether someone is eligible for the new medication, said it is still reviewing whether to offer Aduhelm to its own patients.
The FDA approved Aduhelm for patients who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques, but later narrowed that to just those in the early stages of the disease - the group tested in clinical trials.
UCLA Health System said none of its providers have asked to use Aduhelm, with many awaiting additional data before making a final decision.
Biogen declined to comment on the number of centers using its drug, but said it expects the rollout to be gradual.
MEDICARE LIMITS
Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people eligible for Aduhelm are covered by Medicare, which could incur a $29 billion annual spending increase, according to Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Experts say Medicare could seek to lower the therapy's cost to taxpayers by limiting access to the treatment, linking coverage to real-world evidence of patient outcomes, or setting a fixed payment that combines drug reimbursement with other costs related to the treatment.
""Given the potential budgetary impact, it could be that things are departing from normal,"" said Dan Ollendorf, of the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. 
Tufts and others have called for Medicare to go beyond a national coverage determination and institute a policy known as coverage with evidence development.
Under such a program, data on Aduhelm's real-world effectiveness and safety would be compiled in a Medicare patient registry, quickly providing new data to analyze.

Medicare could also institute a stricter ""demonstration project"" for Aduhelm that would pay for the drug's use at a limited number of medical centers and for a fixed amount that bundles in costs for scans, follow-up and to monitor for side effects.
While Medicare is prevented by law from negotiating drug prices, this type of approach could limit reimbursement to hospitals, possibly at an amount below Aduhelm's list price. That could put pressure on Biogen to cut the price if it wants Aduhelm to be used, said Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins.

DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive plans to build a second U.S. assembly plant that will also include battery cell production, according to four people familiar with the matter.
""While it's early in an evolving process, Rivian is exploring locations for a second U.S. manufacturing facility,"" Rivian spokeswoman Amy Mast said on Thursday. She declined to provide further details.
Multiple U.S. states have bid for the plant - dubbed ""Project Tera"" in documents - which will be announced in a couple of months and break ground early next year, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. The timing could still change given the coronavirus pandemic, which has already delayed the planned announcement from the summer, the sources said.
""We look forward to working with a supportive, technology-forward community in order to create a partnership as strong as the one we have with Normal,"" Mast said. 
Rivian's existing U.S. plant is in Normal, Illinois. 
The typical cost of a new vehicle assembly plant at present is $1 billion or more, while a battery cell production factory is at least $2 billion. Other automakers have partnered with battery manufacturers on cell production. Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co supplies battery cells to Rivian.
Automakers are racing to develop EVs as China, Europe and other countries and regions mandate lower carbon emissions. In the United States, traditional carmakers like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co are retrofitting plants for EV production, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, and startups including Lucid and Canoo have existing plants or are adding them. 
California-based Rivian, also backed by Ford and T. Rowe Price, aims to compete when it rolls out its R1T pickup and R1S SUV, as well as a delivery van for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Rivian will seek a valuation of well over $50 billion in a potential public listing later this year, according to another source familiar with the matter.
COVID-CAUSED DELAYS 
Rivian, which has raised $8 billion since the start of 2019, had a valuation of $27.6 billion in January after a $2.65 billion investment round led by T. Rowe Price. Other investors in Rivian include Soros Fund Management, Fidelity, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ). 
2021 has been tough for Rivian, however, as Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a letter to customers last week that COVID-19 had delayed the launch of its vehicles. The first deliveries of the R1T, previously slated for July, were pushed to September, while the R1S was delayed to the fall. 
A second U.S. plant will expand the company's capacity and include a 50 gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery cell production operation built in phases, as well as a product and technology center, according to documents seen by Reuters that were submitted to state economic development officials. While the documents did not mention Rivian, sources told Reuters that Tera and Rivian were one and the same. 
The proposal listed spring 2021 as the period in which states would be notified of the company's decision, with ""mobilization"" likely in the summer, and then the start of construction in the fall. However, the pandemic has delayed that timeline, the sources said.
The project requires an estimated 2,000 acres of land and the site would seek to achieve net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible, according to the proposal.

Launch editions of Rivian's pickup and SUV are priced at $73,000 and $75,500, respectively, with 2022 models available for preorder at $67,500 for the R1T and $70,000 for the R1S. Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian through 2024, with production scheduled to begin in the fall of this year. 
Scaringe told Reuters last November that Rivian planned to follow the initial three vehicles with smaller models targeted at China and Europe.

(Reuters) -Biogen Inc on Thursday said getting hospitals and clinics to use its new Alzheimer's disease drug Aduhelm and insurers to reimburse it has been slower than it expected, as controversy mounts over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval process for the treatment.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker's top scientist also defended the science behind the approval as well as the company's interactions with U.S. regulators before the FDA's June 7 action https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-rule-controversial-biogen-alzheimers-drug-2021-06-07. 
The FDA's acting commissioner, Janet Woodcock, has asked the Department of Health and Human Services' internal watchdog office to investigate https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fda-calls-federal-investigation-into-approval-biogens-alzheimers-drug-2021-07-09 whether talks between Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and the agency were consistent with the regulator's policies.
Aduhelm, administered through an infusion, was approved despite one of its two large-scale clinical trials failing to show a benefit to patients. The approval was based on evidence that Aduhelm can reduce brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's disease, rather than evidence demonstrating that it slows progression of the lethal mind-wasting disease.
Biogen's head of research and development, Alfred Sandrock, said in a conference call with investors that he believes that ongoing studies being conducted by the company, including one required by the FDA after the approval, would show that reducing these plaques could help slow cognitive decline associated with the disease. 
Some prominent doctors, hospitals and health insurers have criticized the FDA's approval and said they will not offer the drug, including the Cleveland Clinic and New York's Mount Sinai Health System.
""A few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to Aduhelm for now. Now remember though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they have asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients,"" Alisha Alaimo, president of Biogen US, said on the call. 
'A BIT SLOWER'
Biogen had previously said 900 medical centers would be ready to administer the drug shortly after its launch. So far, 35% of those sites have either completed a review and approved it for use or indicated they will not need a review of the drug. 
""Overall, it's a bit slower than what we assumed, but we are making tremendous progress with some positives and some headwinds,"" Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos said. 
Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said some doctors or medical centers may be hesitant to build inventory considering they will not know how they will be reimbursed unless Medicare sets a standardized policy for coverage of the drug.
Medicare, the government healthcare program for people over age 65, this month launched a nine-month process to formulate standardized national coverage terms for Aduhelm. For now, claims are being handled by Medicare's regional offices.
Medicare held its first public hearing on the topic on Thursday. 
""The main factor delaying treatment is uncertainty about coverage,"" Dr. Stephen Salloway of Brown Medical School and Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, said during the hearing.
""I'm concerned that patients who may benefit will not have access to treatment during the nine months prior to the NCD (national coverage decision) and may not be eligible for treatment later,"" Salloway added.
Biogen said it expects modest revenue from Aduhelm this year and to ramp up thereafter, adding that it is seeing ""strong indications of very high initial patient interest as well as increased referrals.""
The drug brought in revenue of $2 million in the first few weeks since its approval, below expectations of $3.23 million. A ""big chunk"" of that revenue so far reflects product that had been shipped to customers as inventory and had not yet been administered to patients, Vounatsos said.
In an open letter https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/open-letter-alzheimers-disease-community-our-head-research-and, Sandrock said the drug's approval process ""has been the subject of extensive misinformation and misunderstanding.""
""It is normal for scientists and clinicians to discuss data from experiments and clinical trials, to debate, and to disagree, on the interpretation of data,"" Sandrock wrote.

In its earnings report issued on Thursday, Biogen raised its forecast for total sales to $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion this year, from $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion previously.
Biogen shares were up 1.6% at $328.27 in midday trading.

The maker of Rafale warplanes and Falcon business jets saw operating income more than treble to 175 million euros ($206 million) from 55 million in the first half as net sales rose to 3.1 billion euros from 2.64 billion.
The business aviation market shows ""encouraging signs of improvement,"" particularly in the United States, Dassault said in a statement.
""Nevertheless, we note that price pressures remain,"" it said, although it described the market for second-hand jets as buoyant.
Dassault delivered six Falcon business jets in the first half of the year, down from 16 in the same period of 2020, and took orders for 25 jets, up from 5 a year earlier.
It delivered 13 Rafale jets for export to India and Qatar.
The company continues to target 25 new Rafale and an equal number of new Falcon deliveries in 2021, as well as higher net sales.

Dassault said on Wednesday it had delivered the first of six brand-new and 12 second-hand ex-French military Rafale combat jets sold to Greece earlier this year.

However, because a long and deep market correction is not expected, it could be wise to bet on promising stocks that are now trading at discounts. For example, Honda Motor (HMC), Hill-Rom Holdings (NYSE:HRC),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), and Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC) look undervalued at their current price levels. So, we think these stocks could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.COVID-19 cases have this month resurfaced in the United States, with the Delta variant spreading nationwide. As the number of daily cases spikes in several other countries too, the stock market could witness panic selling on investors’ concerns that the resurgence of COVID-19 could mar the economic recovery. All three major benchmark indices corrected to a degree last week. And the CBOE Volatility Index surged as high as 25 last week, its highest level since May.
Since the jitters around the rising COVID-19 cases could lead to several overpriced stocks suffering declines in the near term, it could be an opportune time to bet on quality stocks that are trading at reasonable valuations. This year, value stocks have performed quite well, as evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 15.1% returns year-to-date.
So, we think it could be wise to bet now on fundamentally sound stocks Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC),  Hill-Rom Holdings Inc . (HRC), Foot Locker, Inc. (FL), and Boise Cascade Company (BCC). They are currently trading at discounts to their peers.

So, we believe Zoetis (ZTS) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) are likely to benefit from the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on. Zoetis Inc . (NYSE:ZTS) and Chewy, Inc. (CHWY) are two prominent players in the pet care industry. ZTS develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary vaccines and medicines, complemented by diagnostic products and genetic tests and supported by various services. In contrast, CHWY operates an online platform to sell pet food, medications, and other pet-related products.
A significant increase in pet adoption amid the pandemic, as people spent much more time at home, has led to greatly increased spending on pet food and medications. As the spending on pets grows, companies in this space are accelerating their research and development to benefit from the rising demand for drugs, vaccines, diagnostic devices, and pet-friendly products and services. As a result, the global pet care market is expected to grow at 5.2% CAGR to $255.40 billion by 2027. Investor optimism toward this sector is evident in the ProShares Pet Care ETF’s (PAWZ) 7.9% gains over the past three months, compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 4.6% returns. Thus, both ZTS and CHWY should benefit from the industry tailwinds.
While CHWY's stock price has lost 8% year-to-date, ZTS’ has surged 20.9%. In terms of their past six months’ performance, ZTS is a clear winner with 22.5% gains versus CHWY’s negative returns. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 12:11PM ET</span>",Quest Diagnostics sees uptick in COVID-19 testing as Delta variant spreads,"By Mrinalika Roy and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -U.S. laboratory Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) Inc said on Thursday demand for COVID-19 testing had increased since the end of June as the more infectious Delta variant spreads across the country.
The comments come as the Delta variant has become the dominant version of the virus in the United States and many other countries, sparking fears of slower economic recovery and pummelling stock markets earlier this week.
The improvements in COVID-19 testing demand and a rebound in its core non-coronavirus businesses helped the company forecast full-year revenue between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion, above a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $9.49 billion.
The company also beat expectations for second-quarter results, driven by 40.2% growth in its unit that provides tests for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and neurology.
The results signaled that demand for Quest and rival  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT)' non-COVID-19 businesses was returning as vaccinated Americans become more comfortable with visiting doctors for regular check-ups and other ailments.
""We expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephen Rusckowski said during a call with analysts. 
Quest, which had warned of waning demand for coronavirus tests earlier in 2021 after generating billions of dollars in sales last year, said it expects a decline in clinical testing of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.
But it expects a rise in surveillance and pooled testing for schools and offices.
""COVID-19 testing remains critical as people return to work and schools reopen in the next few weeks,"" Rusckowski said.
The company expects to perform at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day during the second half of 2021, below the average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 12:11PM ET</span>",Russian airlines bet on domestic recovery with airshow deals,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's airlines struck deals for more than 80 regional jets at its flagship airshow this week, according to state-backed aerospace and leasing companies, as carriers bet on a partial market recovery driven by domestic flights. 
Russia, like other countries, has heavily restricted international air traffic due to the coronavirus since last year, but domestic flight routes are already recovering.
State-owned companies backed by state leasing companies dominated the ranks of buyers and sellers at the MAKS-2021 biennial airshow that opened on Tuesday near Moscow.
Five airlines, three of them state-owned, signed agreements to order 58 Sukhoi Superjet 100s and 22 new Ilyushin Il-114 regional jets, according to state-backed aerospace group United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and state-owned leasing company GTLK.
The domestically-made Superjet is a regional aircraft that entered service in 2011.
State-run Red Wings signed an agreement for the delivery of 25 Superjet planes; private airline Azimuth and Aurora, which the government wants to turn into a far east regional carrier, signed agreements for the delivery of 10 and eight of the planes, respectively, UAC said. 
Flag carrier Aeroflot's Rossiya subsidiary ordered 15 Superjets. The deals point to the rising role of the aircraft on regional Russian routes. The aircraft is only used by Russian airlines and has struggled to find foreign buyers. 
Azimuth also ordered six Airbus A220-300 jets on Wednesday, with deliveries set to begin next year.
Mikhail Ganelin, a senior analyst at Aton, said it could be profitable for airlines to acquire Russian regional aircraft because of favourable terms offered by state leasing companies and subsidies for flights that don't pass through Moscow. 
""The crisis is severe, but the domestic market is very good, it has almost recovered,"" he said. 
Russian airlines lost half of their revenue last year. But domestic flights have helped to start a recovery, with local routes almost reaching 2019 levels between January and May and since then even exceeding those levels. 

Total passenger traffic, including international flights, is still far from pre-crisis levels, however. It was down by almost a quarter in January-June compared with 2019.
Aeroflot has said it expects a full market recovery in 2022-2023.

(Reuters) -Blackstone Group Inc said on Thursday its second-quarter distributable earnings nearly doubled year-on-year, driven by a surge in asset sales across its real estate, private equity and credit businesses.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX)'s shares rose 4.5% on Thursday morning, pushing its market capitalization to a record high of $131 billion, overtaking  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), another Wall Street heavyweight. 
Shares of other publicly listed private equity firms also staged record rallies as they capitalized on frothy market valuations to cash out on assets for top dollar. Private equity firms that had previously been wary of a stock market debut, such as TPG and L Catterton, are now considering following suit, Reuters has reported.
Blackstone's distributable earnings, which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to $1.1 billion from $548 million a year earlier. 
This translated into distributable earnings per share of 82 cents, surpassing the average analyst estimate of 78 cents, data compiled by Refinitiv showed. 
Blackstone said its capital deployment reached a record $23.8 billion during the quarter. It also committed to investing an additional $28.5 billion in deals such as acquiring a majority stake in medical supplier Medline Industries Inc alongside  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc and Hellman & Friedman. 
Buoyant capital markets and rising company valuations allowed Blackstone to cash out a lot of its investments. Total asset sales reached $19.6 billion, including the $2.9 billion divestment of its portfolio of warehouse and logistics assets in Australia.
""We remain focused on our high-conviction thematic areas, such as sustainability, logistics, digital infrastructure, housing and the post-COVID travel recovery,"" Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said during an earnings call with analysts.
The buyout firm said its private equity portfolio grew 13.8% in the second quarter, compared with a 8.2% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 9.4% and 5.7%, respectively.
Last week, Blackstone said it reached a $7.3 billion agreement with insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) to buy a portfolio of rent-controlled apartments and a nearly 10% stake in a life and retirement unit that will be spun off from the insurance giant.
This will bring in an additional $50 billion in assets under management, pushing Blackstone's total insurance assets to $150 billion, Gray said. Blackstone is also one of the largest U.S. property landlords. 
Blackstone said its net income under generally accepted accounting principles doubled to $1.3 billion, driven by a sharp rise in investment income.

Its total assets under management rose to $684 billion from $648.8 billion in the prior quarter. Unspent capital fell to $129.9 billion from $148.2 billion three months earlier owing to the pace of capital deployments.
Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of 70 cents per share.

Investing.com – Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock fell almost 4% Thursday as the airline’s April-June numbers still came lower than 2019 quarter’s with some hope of recovery though not full in the ongoing quarter.
The company, like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) which also announced its second quarter earnings today, managed to post its first monthly profit in June since the negative effects of the pandemic began in March 2020. This was driven by a surge in leisure travel as people took to travelling after a year’s gap.
Business travel remained sluggish though the company said July has seen weekly improvements in that segment.
The company's second-quarter operating revenue of $4 billion is still almost two-third of 2019 June quarter level.
Load factor was at 89.2% compared to 86.4% in June quarter of 2019.
The company expects load factor to fall month-on-month through August. Operating revenue in July is seen lower by 10%-15% and by 12%-17% in August compared to 2019 levels in those months, respectively, due to fewer holidays from last year.
“Despite steady weekly improvements in business bookings, thus far, in July, the lag in business travel recovery is expected to continue to have a negative impact on close-in demand and average passenger fares in third quarter 2021,” Gary C. Kelly, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, said in a note.
Second quarter net income was $348 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, driven by a $724 million offset of salaries, wages, and benefits expenses related to the receipt of federal government’s fiscal stimulus.
Excluding special items, second quarter net loss was $206 million, a far cry from the $741-million net income in April-June of 2019.

(Reuters) -Domino's Pizza Inc beat estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, as its new menu items, including cheeseburger and chicken taco pizzas, whipped up demand from Americans ordering food from the comfort of their homes.
Shares of the company rose nearly 12% to hit a record high of $526.29, as the pizza chain also authorized a new $1 billion share buyback plan.
Domino's, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic-induced lockdowns, is striving to keep up the momentum of 18 months by opening new stores to cut delivery times and introducing contactless takeaway options.
It has also raised menu prices and delivery fees to cope with a surge in expenses, triggered by higher raw material prices and expenses related to COVID-19.
Those efforts helped drive a 3.5% rise in its U.S. same-store sales, marking 41 consecutive quarters of increases. Analysts were expecting a 1.3% decline.
""You've often asked if our sales growth might be weaker in markets that had more fully reopened ... the opposite trend emerged through the second quarter, where we saw higher levels of sales growth in the second quarter in the markets with fewer COVID-related restrictions,"" Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison said on a post-earnings call.
International same-store sales growth of 13.9% was also well above the 8.9% jump expected by analysts. That boost came from fresh lockdowns in countries, including the United Kingdom and India, where people relied on online ordering.

Total revenue rose 12.2% to $1.03 billion for the second quarter ended June 20, beating estimates of $972.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On an adjusted basis, Domino's earned $3.12 per share, exceeding estimates of $2.87.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>","Spending to fight U.S. unemployment fraud brings boost, scrutiny to Alphabet-funded ID.me","By Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - An unprecedented number of people falsifying identities to claim U.S. jobless benefits during the pandemic sparked a surge in government spending to curtail the fraud, creating a fierce new battle in the identification business. 
No company may be benefiting more than ID.me, founded in 2010 as a Craigslist for verified military veterans and valued at $1.5 billion in financing this year by funds including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's CapitalG. 
ID.me in a year has gone from vetting unemployment claimants in zero states to 27, to help address what the U.S. government said could amount to $87 billion in improper unemployment benefits payments during the pandemic.
Many of those states have exercised ""emergency"" or ""sole-source"" exemptions to skip getting competing bids, according to records Reuters reviewed from 11 agencies. 
The fast growth is now attracting scrutiny from an industry-backed watchdog group into whether a national association may have unfairly steered business to ID.me. It also led to delays for some benefits-seekers, according to ID.me's chief executive and seven former workers who spoke with Reuters. 
Graphic: Wait time falls for speaking to ID.me referees: https://graphics.reuters.com/IDME-STATES/oakvedkeqpr/chart.png 
The former ID.me workers said that non-English speakers, the elderly and people of color sometimes waited days for verification because the company lacked multilingual agents. They added that sometimes users struggled with glitchy video conferencing from Pexip Holding ASA, and said some Black applicants were wrongly flagged by the company's fraud-detection software. 
Workers had to verify at least 30 people per eight-hour shift and could wait no more than six minutes for users to respond or solve tech issues, said the sources, including former contractors Carlos Moran, Russell Schwartz and Valerie Blankenship. 
ID.me CEO Blake Hall told Reuters that language support is expanding, and said the company forewarned states about waits and they never extended beyond a day.
""This is a crisis situation. There were no good choices,"" said Hall, a former Army Captain. 
Hall added that Pexip offers strong security, and that industry-standard ""efficiency targets"" did not apply to troubleshooting. Pexip did not respond to comment for this story. 
With at least some issues addressed, investors are bullish that the McLean, Virginia company is joining a long list of internet services emerging from the pandemic as essential tools. 
Graphic: ID.me's users surge amid unemployment deals: https://graphics.reuters.com/IDME-STATES/xklvyxwnmpg/chart.png 
Market researcher Juniper expects global annual sales of online identity verification services to reach nearly $16.7 billion in 2025, up 77% from this year. 
ID.me, which has nearly tripled to over 50 million users since last March, wants to let them enter the same email and password combination to log into tax or Social Security accounts, download mobile keys for hotel rooms, or prove they are a veteran, nurse or teacher to secure e-commerce deals.
It envisions ""Sign in with ID.me"" buttons on apps alongside ""Sign in with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)"" and ""Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Login."" 
""There's a huge identity opportunity because there's no national identity system,"" said Jesse Wedler, a partner at CapitalG. ""ID.me has this out-of-the-box solution.""
SELFIE CHECKS
ID.me's automated verification technology analyzes evidence and records, including comparing users' selfies with pictures they take of their driver's license or other identification. If that fails, users can show additional documentation on the video chats with ID.me's ""trusted referees https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/referees."" It saves selfies as another dataset to check against later.
With COVID-19 closing state offices and boosting identity theft, officials saw value in face checks and video chats. A federal law passed last December also required identity verification for aid. ID.me struck its first deal last June with Florida. About 15% of unemployment claimants have needed video chats, Hall said. 
Graphic: ID.me verifies most users without video calls: https://graphics.reuters.com/IDME-STATES/xklpyxwqmvg/chart.png 
Arizona credited ID.me for reducing fraud and ensuring timely benefits delivery. New Jersey described ID.me as ""a tremendous asset,"" and California called it the best of 12 vendors it considered, including Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Inc.
Rivals, including Relx Plc's LexisNexis, which itself went from serving 11 states to 21 during the pandemic, say failed selfie checks needlessly delayed payment to millions of jobless people. They contend that most Americans can be verified without photos by just checking against device information, credit histories or property and utilities records.
Hall for years has said that approach disadvantages recent immigrants, lower-income families and others with what the industry calls ""thin files,"" forcing them to verify offline.
Competitors view his concerns as outdated. But they do not offer video appeals, through which ID.me has verified 1.24 million claimants, Hall said. No state has canceled it.
 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, the parent of Reuters News, offers Pondera software, which spots suspicious patterns among applicants and is being used in seven states including California and Nevada. For a FACTBOX of players in the space, click
'ENDORSED ID.ME' 
But lawmakers and taxpayer advocates have begun to scrutinize whether ID.me was the best choice to handle the influx of users.
The IT Acquisition Advisory Council said it wrote to officials including the U.S. Department of Labor's inspector general that the influential National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) may have interfered with open-competition requirements by recommending ID.me to the exclusion of others.
North Carolina said in its sole-source waiver that NASWA ""endorsed ID.me,"" Pennsylvania cited NASWA guidance in its selection process and Washington state received $177,500 from a NASWA affiliate to try ID.me, records show.
NASWA and Hall denied any endorsement, saying the group facilitates information sharing about tools but does not preference any. The states did not respond to requests for comment. The inspector general declined to comment. 

Contracts and payments obtained by Reuters for ID.me services in 16 states collectively are worth at least $29 million. The company says its overall annual recurring revenue is $150 million.
""You'll start to see some oversight hearings for sure: What are the pitfalls we saw during an extreme, high-pressure time and what are the guardrails we need?"" California State Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez told Reuters.

(Reuters) -Union Pacific Corp on Thursday raised its forecast for annual volume growth after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, as the top U.S. railroad operator benefits from a sustained recovery in industrial activity.
U.S. railroad companies have seen an improvement in demand as economic activity picks up in North America following a relaxation in lockdowns, with CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) also reporting higher revenue. 
""We continue to be encouraged by the strength and the industrial production forecast for the rest of 2021"" Executive Vice President Kenny Rocker said in a conference call with analysts.
Industrial shipments contributed to more than a third of  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP)'s freight revenue in the second quarter ended June 30.
The company also increased its share repurchase target by $1 billion to about $7 billion, sending its shares 2.2% higher.
Its quarterly profit jumped 59% to $1.798 billion, or $2.72 per share versus analysts' average profit estimates of $2.52, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
Union Pacific raised its volume growth forecast to 7% from about 6% earlier, on hopes that the recovery in industrial production will continue and high demand for lumber and refrigerated products will sustain. Its second-quarter volumes jumped 22%.

Revenue rose 29.7% to $5.504 billion from $4.24 billion a year ago, beating expectations of $5.34 billion, while operating ratio — a key profitability metric — improved to 55.1% from 61%.
The company also warned about congestion at U.S. ports, saying that the congestion at West Coast ports has spread to the East, impacting some of its inland terminals, including Chicago. Union Pacific mainly operates west of the Mississippi river.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian luxury boss Brunello Cucinelli is offering six months of paid leave to a handful of employees who have refused to vaccinate in order to protect workers who have taken their shots. 
As the Rome government debated whether to make the jabs mandatory in some workplaces, Cucinelli said on Thursday that less than 1% of his group's 1,200 workers had opted out of a vaccination campaign organised by the company a month ago.
""Clearly within the company their identity became known straight away. Now, as it's only logic, the lads who used to work at the same table don't want to be near those who have chosen not to get vaccinated,"" Cucinelli told La Repubblica and La Stampa newspapers.
""My proposal for them is to stay home with six months paid leave and then we'll see,"" he said. ""I can't impose the vaccine, but I can't put at risk those who decided to get vaccinated either.""
Cucinelli, famous for $1,000-plus cashmere sweaters, often promotes what he calls a ""humanistic"" approach to capitalism, based on respect for people and nature. 
The company is headquartered in the medieval hamlet of Solomeo, in central Italy, where Cucinelli has repaved roads, planted vineyards, built a theatre and founded an arts and crafts school.
His offer for vaccine hold-outs comes as Italy's business lobby Confindustria called this week for anti-COVID jabs to be made mandatory in the workplace - a proposal that looks unlikely to make much progress given political opposition to such measures.
Vaccination is already mandatory for health workers, and the government led by Mario Draghi is debating whether to extend that requirement to school personnel. 

Italy, worried by a rapid surge in coronavirus infections, is also weighing whether to only allow people vaccinated with at least one dose into cinemas, restaurants and sports clubs, following similar restrictions imposed in France. An announcement is expected later on Thursday.
Opponents of tighter measures, including League leader Matteo Salvini whose party is part of the ruling majority, say they infringe on the freedom of choice of those who do not want the vaccination, and could delay a badly needed economic recovery.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss drugmaker Roche said on Thursday that strong demand for COVID-19 tests had helped it rebound from a weak start to the year, as it posted better-than-expected sales for the first half. 
However, the Basel-based company flagged an anticipated slowdown in demand for the tests, which have helped it fare better than some drugmakers as the number of routine hospital visits and demand for other medicines fell during the pandemic.
""As expected, demand for COVID-19 tests peaked in the second quarter and is likely to decrease in the second half of the year (although this) depends on how the pandemic develops,"" Chief Executive Severin Schwan said on a call with reporters, adding that there were still significant uncertainties.
Overall sales in the six months to June rose by 8% at constant currency rates to 30.71 billion Swiss francs ($33.48 billion) with core earnings up 6% to 10.56 francs per share. Analysts on average had expected sales of 29.93 billion francs and earnings of 10.10 francs per share, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
Roche's shares were down 1.6% to 350.15 Swiss francs by 1204 GMT, the biggest decliner on the European pharmaceuticals index. 
Strong momentum in other routine testing also boosted sales at the diagnostics division, which masked a 3% decline in pharmaceutical sales in the first six months.
ZKB analysts acknowledged that turnover was ""significantly"" better than expected, but said the lift from diagnostics was more likely to be considered a ""flash in the pan"".
Roche offers tests for everything from active COVID-19 infections to the antibodies that document immunity after somebody has been infected or vaccinated. 
It is also in discussions with U.S. authorities over the use of its Gantenerumab drug as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, which if approved could see it become a blockbuster.
Roche, which expects to increase its dividend this year, maintained its forecast for 2021 sales to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit rate at constant exchange rates, with core earnings per share growing by a similar amount.
""This virus will stay with us, it will continue to mutate, and as such there will be a continued need for vaccines, for new vaccines and boosters, as well as tests and medicines,"" CEO Schwan said. 

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts, however, said the move to leave guidance unchanged after a strong first-half performance could be seen as conservative.

Investing.com – Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock rose nearly 2% Thursday as the biotech company revised its annual guidance while reporting second-quarter revenue of $2 million from the sale of its controversial drug for Alzheimer’s.
The company now expects total revenue of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion in the ongoing financial year. It had earlier guided for annual revenue between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion.
Guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share and the capex was kept unchanged. EPS outlook remains in the range of $17.50 to $19 and capex $375 million to $425 million.
“This financial guidance continues to assume modest Aduhelm revenue in 2021, ramping thereafter,” the company said in a note, referring to the Alzheimer's drug.
Biogen said both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations, program readouts, and investments in Aduhelm.
On June 7, Aduhelm became the first drug in 18 years to secure Food and Drug Administration’s nod for treatment of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease.
Biogen is charging $56,000 for an annual course, a price drawing much criticism from advocacy groups.
The FDA has been accused of ignoring the advice of its own outside advisors, who said Biogen did not provide enough evidence of clinical benefit over the existing prescriptions. According to some, FDA’s decision was hasty.
Three members of the FDA’s advisory panel resigned in protest against the regulator’s decision.
At least three hospitals including Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai have decided against using Aduhelm.
Second-quarter revenue fell 25% year-on-year to $2.77 billion. Amortization expenses rose short of 10-fold to $604.1 million. Diluted EPS was $2.99 as against $9.59 in the same quarter a year ago.

(Reuters) - Chemicals maker Dow Inc on Thursday forecast better-than-expected sales for the current quarter, betting on increased industrial production, and higher consumer spending as economies emerge from pandemic-led lockdowns.
Dow also beat estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue as its chemicals - used in everything from plastic and food packaging to textiles, electronics and paints - have seen a steady rise in prices on the back of strong consumer and industrial demand as well as lower inventories.
The company said it was expecting third-quarter net sales of between $13.75 billion and $14.25 billion, well above the estimates of $12.64 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
""We continue to be in the early stages of economic recovery,"" Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider told Reuters. 
The spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, however, is fuelling fears of a pandemic resurgence and lockdowns across different parts of the globe, threatening the recovery.
""The Delta variant may lead to some slowness in specific countries or regions for a period of time, but over the next four to eight quarters, we still see strong demand,"" he said.
Ungerleider also said Dow will cut expenses, accelerate digital investments and raise prices to offset increases in logistics, shipping and raw material costs. 
Product prices jumped 16% in the second quarter from the prior period, while volumes rose 1%, helped by growing demand in infrastructure, industrial and personal-care end markets.
Volumes were weighed down by lingering supply constraints from the impact of a winter storm on the U.S. Gulf Coast in February.

Adjusted net operating income doubled to $2.72 per share and beat estimates of $2.45, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net sales of $13.89 billion also topped estimates of $13.07 billion.

(Reuters) -Unilever Plc warned on Thursday that surging commodity costs would squeeze its full-year operating margin, overshadowing strong second-quarter sales growth fuelled by the easing of pandemic-related curbs in many of its markets.
Underlying sales for the maker of Dove soap rose 5% in the three months ended June 30, above 4.8% forecast by analysts. 
It maintained its 3-5% sales growth forecast for the year, but rising prices of everything from crude to palm and soybean oil made the company cut its operating margin outlook to ""about flat"" from ""slightly up"" earlier and flag greater uncertainty surrounding that forecast.
The warning dragged shares of the FTSE 100-listed company down 6.2% by 1345 GMT, wiping off nearly 7 billion pounds ($9.65 billion)of its market value, and making it the top loser on the index on Thursday.
Finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said he expected cost inflation to be in the high-teens in the second half, above the mid-teens rise anticipated earlier.
He said that since the company issued its guidance in the first quarter, crude oil prices had risen 12%, soy bean oil 21%; while freight and transportation costs had risen and 4% and 7%, respectively. 
Unilever (NYSE:UL) said that besides accelerating price hikes, it was introducing pack changes and narrowing promotions in the second half in response to rising costs.
The company raised prices by 1.6% in second quarter. In June those were up to 2.2%
""It is that eternal triangle of the competitiveness of our growth, .... landing the pricing and managing the cost inflation,"" Pitkethly said. 
Chief Executive Alan Jope said the lag between the impact of commodity costs and the benefits of increased product prices had created ""a higher than normal range of likely year end margin outcomes."" 
Investec analyst Alicia Forry called the message on costs slightly disappointing. 
""They had been confident of passing through cost inflation at the first quarter stage...now they change their tune.""
INFERNO BOOST
Half-year sales rose 5.4%, a touch above the 5.3% forecast, propelled by 8.1% growth in its Foods and Refreshment division, as living restrictions began to ease in many markets.
In Europe, sales of ice cream eaten out of home grew at double-digits, boosted by markets like Italy where its new Magnum lines honoring Dante - Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso - sold well. Sales of teas also saw strong volume growth.
Jope also said the company was ""fully committed to staying in Israel"" after the company was embroiled in a controversy earlier this week over its U.S. subsidiary Ben & Jerry's move to end ice cream sales in occupied Palestinian territories that has caused a backlash against the brand in Israel.
Unilever also said it had completed the review of its tea business, and anticipates either an initial public offering, sale or partnership as a final outcome of the separation.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, losing some early momentum from futures markets, after a rise in initial jobless claims added to concerns that the renewed spread of the Covid-19 virus could disrupt the economic recovery. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6 points, effectively flat, at 34,792 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both fractionally higher, after another round of generally solid earnings updates. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims had risen to 419,000 last week, their highest in two months. Analysts noted, however, that the figures may be distorted by the fact that the auto sector's plant closures for routine plant maintenance have been disrupted by the pandemic, making the usual seasonal adjustments less accurate.
There was also a note of caution from the semiconductor sector, after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) issued conspicuously conservative guidance for the current quarter late on Wednesday. Texas stock was down 5.0% in early trading. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the U.S.'s biggest chipmaker, reports its earnings after the closing bell. 
DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock was also lower by 4.7% on concerns that the best of the housing market boom may be over. The homebuilder reported a 77% rise in net profit but warned that it had had to slow the acceptance of customer orders due to high lumber prices and a shortage of labor. Lumber prices more than quadrupled in the year after the pandemic erupted. They had fallen sharply in recent weeks but are still nearly 50% above end-2019 levels, and the spread of wildfires this week across Canada has threatened a key source of supply, pushing prices higher again.
Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) were again prominent, losing 9.0% after Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities are planning ""possibly unprecedented"" penalties against the company for defying regulators who advised it to delay its initial public offering in New York. Bloomberg said the penalties may even include forcing it to delist.
AT&T (NYSE:T) stock fell 0.3%, despite reporting much stronger than expected net subscriber growth both for its key mobile phone business and for its HBO streaming service. The company raised its full-year forecasts accordingly.
On the plus side,  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) stock surged 9.0% to a new record high after the shoemaker reported earnings well ahead of expectations, operating income near-tripling in the year through June. The company also raised its guidance for the full year and now expects revenue growth over over 60% and an operating margin of some 25%.  Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) stock likewise surged 10% after reporting a strong second quarter.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock meanwhile rose 0.5% after the company admitted a slow start to sales of its Alzheimer's drug which was, nonetheless, not as bad as some had feared."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap is set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $30 billion bid for  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.
The deal between the world's two largest aircraft leasing companies would create a new financing giant and the largest buyer of airliners built by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The deal will reshape a global air finance industry that has in recent years attracted a flood of capital from investors seeking higher returns.

The European Commission, which has set a July 26 deadline for its preliminary review of the deal, and AerCap declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Justice wrapped up its review of the deal last month.
The deal to buy GECAS, or GE Capital Aviation Services, includes about $24 billion in cash and $1 billion paid in AerCap notes or cash. It includes 111 million new shares and will give GE a stake of 46% in the AerCap-controlled company.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co turned in its best quarterly profit in about six years on Thursday, helped by solid demand for its high-margin sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and its premium Genesis cars. 
Hyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's 10 biggest automakers by sales, reported net profit of 1.8 trillion won ($1.57 billion) for April-June versus 227 billion won in the same period a year earlier.
That compared with an average analyst forecast of 1.6 trillion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
""Sales of SUV models and Genesis luxury brand models drove the momentum in sales volume, and declining incentives helped lift revenue and profitability in the second quarter as the ongoing recovery from the global COVID-19 pandemic spurred automotive demand,"" Hyundai said in a statement.
The strong result was also backed by Hyundai's conservative supply chain management, which has helped it navigate a global chip shortage better than many other automakers, analysts said.
But the prolonged shortage and other component supply issues have started catching up with Hyundai, disrupting its electric vehicle production in particular.
In April, Hyundai suspended production at a factory making the Ioniq 5 electric crossover because of chip and component supply issues. 
On Thursday, it said it expects on-year sales growth might slow in the second half of 2021 due to challenging business conditions, including raw material price fluctuation and unstable supplies of automotive chips.
The automaker also said it expects the global chip shortage to gradually become less acute in the second half of the year, adding that it is pursuing partnerships with major semiconductor companies to maintain stable supply conditions.
""Those procurement issues are expected to improve in the second half of the year,"" said analyst Lee Jae-il at Eugene Investment & Securities, pointing to an improved supply forecast last week by major producer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. 
The Taiwanese chipmaker said the shortage in auto chips will gradually ease for its customers from the current quarter but expects overall semiconductor capacity tightness to extend possibly into next year.
Hyundai and its affiliates are in talks with local chip companies to reduce reliance on foreign supplies, Reuters reported last month.

Shares of Hyundai Motor, Asia's fifth-biggest automaker by market value, rose 0.2% after the firm published its earnings results, compared with a 1% rise in the broader market.

By Rachel Armstrong and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's government on Thursday unveiled a blueprint for returning NatWest to majority private ownership within a year, more than a decade since bailing out the lender at the height of the global financial crisis.
The finance ministry said it had instructed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to sell NatWest shares on its behalf in a scheme starting on Aug. 12 and running until Aug. 11, 2022. 
NatWest shares have rallied 23% since the start of the year, supported by the recovery from the pandemic. But they are still far below the 502-pence level of the 2008 taxpayer rescue, making further substantial losses on the bailout likely.
At 1120 GMT, NatWest shares were trading at 196.80 pence, down 1% from the previous day's close. 
The British state currently owns around 54.7% of NatWest after spending 45 billion pounds ($61.87 billion) bailing out the lender 13 years ago. 
The government said it planned to sell up to 15% of the total volume of NatWest shares being traded on the market over the duration of the plan. 
That would roughly equate to around 2 billion pounds, or 8.8% of shares, based on the last three month of trading volume, analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimated in a note.
Morgan Stanley will only sell shares at or above a price per share that the government has determined ""delivers value for money for the taxpayer"". 
""This move will be welcomed by investors and should improve liquidity in the stock as well as reinforcing the government's desire to reduce/exit its shareholding, even if the plan weighs on the share price over the next 12 months,"" said Ronan Dunphy, banking analyst at Goodbody. 
""If the market is judged to be able to digest the sell down without an uncomfortable price reaction, we wouldn't be surprised to see (the government) seek to reduce its shareholding further.""
NatWest CEO Alison Rose welcomed the government's plan and said it showed the bank was on a better footing.
The plan to sell shares on the open market also opens the door to NatWest buying back up to 10% of its shares.
Details of the share sale come after the government sold 1.1 billion pounds worth of NatWest shares through a one-off stock offering in May. 
NatWest also bought a similar chunk of stock directly from the government in March, but is prevented from launching another directed buyback for 12 months under company rules restricting it to buying around 5% of its stock through this route.

The government said it may also sell NatWest shares through other means such as accelerated bookbuilds or directing share buybacks.

Investing.com – AT&T (NYSE:T) stock rose 1.4% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company notched up solid growth in both telecom and media businesses in the second quarter.
Subscribers willing to pay more for its high-speed 5G and HBO Max streaming services boosted the company’s confidence to revise its guidance.
The company net added 789,000 postpaid subscribers on its telecom network during the second quarter, more than two-and-a-half times the increase on Verizon’s service.
The robust additions reflect consumer demand for better services that support more content and devices.
Postpaid phone-only average revenue per user was $54.24, down a mere 0.4% versus the year-ago quarter, mostly due to the impacts of promotional discount amortization, but was up sequentially.
AT&T Fiber net added 246,000 subscribers.
The company net added 2.8 million subscribers on its HBO Max and HBO platforms in the second quarter in the U.S. This is just short of twice the 1.54 million subscribers Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) added and underscores its emergence as a serious competitor in a space its rival has dominated for years.  
AT&T’s media unit WarnerMedia is being spun off to merge with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and the company hopes to end the year with 70 million to 73 million global HBO Max/HBO subscribers, compared to previous forecast of 67 million-70 million.
The telecom and media giant expects consolidated revenue to grow 2% to 3% and adjusted EPS to grow in the low- to mid-single digits.
Consolidated revenue in the second quarter rose 7.6% to $44 billion. Adjusted EPS rose 7.2% to 89 cents.
Analysts had estimated an EPS of 79 cents on revenue of $42.66 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Smaller banks will be given more time to reach targets for issuing debt to shore up their defences in a crisis, the Bank of England said on Thursday as it seeks to boost competition in a banking sector long dominated by a handful of lenders.
Banks are required to issue MREL, or minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, which is a form of debt that can be written down to absorb losses and avoid repeating the 137 billion pound ($188.6 billion) taxpayer bailout of lenders in Britain during the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
The targets were set under European Union rules, which Britain now can amend more easily after leaving the bloc last December.
""Making it easier for firms to grow into MREL responds directly to firms’ concerns about barriers to growth created by the step up in MREL requirements as firms expand their balance sheets,"" Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said in a statement.
The central bank has authorised 27 new banks since 2013, but Lloyds (LON:LLOY),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC and NatWest continue to dominate retail lending and the so-called challenger banks have said that blunt thresholds for issuing MREL create a ""cliff edge"" that holds them back from building market share.
The BoE proposed replacing its indicative threshold of 15 billion to 25 billion pounds with a notice period setting out when a lender can enter transition to its MREL targets if the company grows beyond 15 billion pounds in total assets.
The central bank would assess a lender's business plan as it approaches the 15 billion pound threshold and issue a bespoke transition path.
""The banking industry must now assess the implications of the new regime in terms of ability to compete, and highlight any potential challenges to how they serve customers or change their business models as a result,"" said Tom Groom, a financial services partner at consultant EY.
The proposals for an extended transition path directly respond to calls for change, the BoE's Ramsden said.
""They are inherently flexible and agile as they allow for a further extension if unforeseen circumstances demand it,"" Ramsden said.

Challenger lenders Metro Bank, TSB and Co-op Bank did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

A quirk of indexing means AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings -- currently pricier than about 90% of S&P 500 members -- has yet to exit the gauge of cheap shares tracked by the exchange-traded fund.
As a result, the movie-theater operator and Reddit favorite will account for 6.95% of the Direxion Low Priced Stock ETF (ticker LOPX) on its first day. While the product targets companies with a share price between $2 and $5, AMC closed Wednesday at $40.78.
The paradox is the latest headache spurred by Wall Street’s unprecedented indexing boom. As more cash tracks benchmarks, and market swings turn extreme, these slow-moving instruments can leave investors exposed to companies that no longer reflect their aims. Most indexes rebalance every quarter or semi-annually.
Read more: A $15.3 Billion Quant ETF Loses Out in Badly-Timed Rebalance
In the case of LOPX, which follows the Solactive Two Bucks Index, the next quarterly rebalance is due in August, at which time AMC will almost certainly be dropped.
“We’re going to sell it,” Dave Mazza, head of product at Direxion, said by phone. “And hopefully, we’ll buy another company that could have that same potential.”
The Solactive Two Bucks index went live in April, but historical data shows AMC would have entered the gauge about a year ago, when its shares were trading around $4. The company has surged more than 1,800% in 2021 amid the mania surrounding so-called meme stocks, which enjoy the support of an army of online retail traders.
That crowd is the primary target for the new fund, according to Mazza. While AMC’s presence makes for an unusual start, it’s a reminder that the ETF could well capture future Reddit-fueled rallies.
“This is a very interesting time in the market on multiple levels,” Mazza said. “Some of the newer investors have been accustomed to only having outsized returns.”
LOPX’s other holdings look more in keeping with its goals. Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL) Inc. and billboard advertising company Clear Channel Outdoors Holdings -- both trading at less than $4 a share -- are among them. The fund carries a 0.5% fee.

(Reuters) -Unilever's chief executive on Thursday said the company was ""fully committed"" to Israel, days after coming under Israeli pressure over a decision by its subsidiary Ben & Jerry's to end ice cream sales in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand took its decision after pressure from pro-Palestinian groups over its business in Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, handled through a licensee partner since 1987.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements on Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
"" If there's one message I want to underscore ... it's that Unilever (NYSE:UL) remains fully committed to our business in Israel,"" CEO Alan Jope told investors during an earnings call. 
He said the group had invested 1 billion shekels ($306 million) in Israel over the past decade and was invested in its startup culture and social programmes. 
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ben-jerry-israel-idTRNIKBN2EQ0ML Unilever on Tuesday about ""severe consequences"" from Ben & Jerry’s decision, calling it an anti-Israel step.
Ben & Jerry's, which has built a reputation as a supporter of social justice causes, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and LGBTQ+ rights campaigns, was acquired by Unilever in 2000 in a deal allowing it to operate with more autonomy than other subsidiaries, which Jope said it exercised in this case.
""This was a decision taken by Ben & Jerry's and its independent board ... and we always recognise the importance of that agreement,"" he said. 
Jope declined to discuss the potential sales impact and played down the tension between the brands, saying ""there was a very healthy dialogue between Ben & Jerry's and the rest of Unilever."" 
Jope also said the subsidiary's efforts broadly fit Unilever's ""brands with purpose"" agenda - which calls for valuing sustainability over just being profit driven.

""The majority of our brand purpose initiatives are very tightly linked to universal human truths and its the nature of what that brand (Ben & Jerry's) does.""

The strong results saw the company join rival Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) in signaling a recovery in their mainstay businesses, after a year in which they had to depend on coronavirus testing to bring in sales.
Abbott said its second-quarter sales, excluding COVID testing, rose more than 11% on an organic basis from the pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019.
Its worldwide diagnostics revenue, excluding coronavirus testing, increased 42.5% from a year earlier, while medical devices sales rose 51.3% on the back of growth in its heart devices business.
But the rise in vaccinations pulled down its COVID-19 testing-related sales to $1.3 billion, from $2.2 billion in the previous quarter.
The company reiterated its 2021 adjusted earnings forecast of $4.30 to $4.50 per share from continuing operations.
The robust quarterly performance is a positive sign for the continued recovery in the medical device industry, J.P.Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.

The company, which caters mostly to small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs and last month reported its first annual loss in 12 years, said that two-thirds of the space it has rented out was not being used. The average rent per square foot in the April-June quarter declined 2.4% from the January-March quarter, but occupancy inched up 1.1 percentage points to 82.7% on a like-for-like basis, it said. 
In a further sign of improving demand, Workspace, whose 58 properties in London are modelled as flexible office spaces, said average monthly enquiries from potential customers had almost doubled to 947 in the April-June quarter compared to a year earlier.
Shares in the mid-cap company, which provides unfurnished spaces to a varied client base from architects to florists and craft beer brewers to app developers, were up 3% by 1100 GMT after losing more than a third of their value since the pandemic took hold. 
The wider industry has been struggling as repeated lockdowns forced people to work from their homes, a shift that major companies including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) are adopting for the long term.
Workspace boss Graham (NYSE:GHM) Clemett acknowledged that some level of uncertainty will continue in the near term, but said there were strong signs that London's businesses were returning to work. England lifted all its pandemic restrictions earlier this week.
LONDON OPENING UP
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said while disruption could continue from the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus, Workspace's occupational signs looked encouraging.
""The prospect of more passing trade and higher overall footfall is clearly giving small businesses the confidence to dip their toe into trading once more,"" Hargreaves' Susannah Streeter said.

While short-term flexible leases and a heavy exposure to small companies battered Workspace's performance last year, the company could benefit from businesses seeking out flexible spaces as they are hesitant to commit to long-term leases.
""Younger employees with little prospect of a regular desk in the office, may opt for a seat in one of Workspace's shared offices, instead of working from the kitchen table for the foreseeable future,"" Streeter said.

Investing.com – Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) fell over 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading following a report that authorities in China are considering slapping “serious, perhaps unprecedented” penalties on the company.
According to Bloomberg, the options before the Chinese authorities range from a fine to even delisting the NYSE-listed company. Regulators are miffed that the ride hailing company chose to go public itself even after being advised to delay the listing, pending a review of its data policies. 
It listed on July 7 and has mostly traded below its issue price since. Its troubles with the Chinese authorities became public soon after.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal last month, China’s cybersecurity watchdog had suggested Didi delay its initial public offering and urged it to conduct a thorough self-examination of its network security.
Didi ignored the advice, a move seen by the Chinese as a challenge to Beijing’s authority, the Bloomberg report said.
Didi and scores of other Chinese companies are currently being investigated for their cybersecurity policy framework and the measures they use to protect the data of the millions of Chinese consumers they have on their platforms.
The Chinese are concerned that Didi, being listed on the NYSE, may have to share such private data on consumers with the regulators in the U.S. as part of its listing requirements."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Japanese automaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has since earlier this week suspended vehicle production at three of its manufacturing plants in Thailand due to a parts shortage, the company said on Thursday.
Toyota Motors Thailand temporarily suspended vehicle production at its Ban Pho Plant on Tuesday, and at its Samrong and Gateway Plants on Wednesday, the company said in a statement. Toyota has a production capacity in Thailand of 550,000 vehicles per year, according to its website.
""The production operation for the next week will be determined at a later stage,"" said the statement, which added that the current suspension was in effect until Friday.
The factory closures in Thailand were due to a shortage of parts caused by the pandemic, it said in a separate statement. 
A Toyota factory in Japan's Aichi Prefecture will also suspend production on July 29-30 and Aug. 2-4 because of the part shortages, the automaker said on Thursday.
The suspensions in Thailand were first reported by Nikkei Asia earlier on Thursday.
A series of coronavirus clusters among Thai factories in June have raised concerns for the country's export sector.
Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest autos assembly and export hub for some of the world's largest carmakers such as Honda and China's Great Wall Motor. The industry accounts for about 10% of Thailand's GDP and manufacturing jobs.
Auto exports have also been a bright spot for Thailand as it tries to restart the pandemic-hit tourism sector.
Domestic car sales are also rebounding, up 15% in June from the same period a year earlier.

Thailand on Thursday reported a record 13,655 coronavirus infections and 87 deaths as the Southeast Asian country tightened travel restrictions to curb the latest outbreak. 
Over 93% of total 453,132 confirmed infections and 3,697 fatalities occurred after April this year.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank market share shrinks in some areas,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s investment banking arm lost market share across an array of key services in the second quarter, data from Dealogic shows, demonstrating the fragility of the recovery at Germany's biggest lender.
Its investment bank, the group's biggest revenue generator, drove the institution to its strongest quarter in seven years at the start of 2021. However, investors have wondered how sustainable progress will be as the bank continues efforts to boost profitability after years of losses.
The group is in the process of shedding 18,000 staff globally as part of that push for a sustainable uplift in profit.
Deutsche Bank reports second-quarter earnings next week, with analysts expecting the bank to have swung into profit even as investment bank revenue declined. Deutsche has said investment bank revenue this year will be ""very close"" to last year despite a return to more normal business after the initial pandemic-induced trading boom.
Figures compiled for Reuters by financial data company Dealogic span 20 years and include business lines that help companies and governments to issue bonds, sustainable financing and syndicated loans.
The dip in market share in most cases is small and quarterly tallies can be choppy, but the data is disappointing for the bank. Executives had said they expected to maintain market share gained under Christian Sewing, who was appointed chief executive in 2018 to turn Deutsche around after a series of embarrassing and costly regulatory failings that have contributed to losses of 8.2 billion euros over the past 10 years.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the data.
Here are key takeaways from the data, plus graphics:
1. The second-quarter slip was broad-based across multiple businesses, though Deutsche gained ground on advisory services for mergers and acquisitions (M&A). 
Graphic: Slipping market share: https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/gjnvwqngyvw/chart.png 
2. One of the sharpest drops was market share for sovereign bond issuance - a blow for the bank after it highlighed market gains in euro-denominated sovereign bonds in the first quarter.

3. Deutsche Bank has been making a push into so-called sustainable financing, which Sewing recently said was ""at the core"" of its strategy. But market share fell again during the quarter, partly reversing recent gains.

4. Sewing has helped to stabilise the bank, boosting market share across many divisions during his tenure. Despite those successes its position in capital markets and M&A is far from the highs of past decades.
""We feel reassured in our view that a substantial portion of our investment bank growth since 2019 is sustainable,"" Sewing told analysts in April. 
Graphic: Recovery under new CEO: https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/jznvnyardpl/chart.png 
The data provides only a partial snapshot of the investment bank and does not cover fixed-income and currency sales and trading, a huge revenue source for the lender. Such trading declined during the second quarter at competing U.S. banks, according to recent earnings reports. 
""Deutsche Bank will not have been able to maintain the very good performance of fixed-income trading in the second quarter,"" said Benjardin Gaertner, a fund manager at Union Investment, a big shareholder in the bank.
Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager with Deka, said he expects the investment bank to have performed well ""on the whole"" in the second quarter.

Though U.S. lenders dominate global investment banking, Deutsche remains a leading player and ranks eighth globally for investment banking fees this year, Refinitiv data shows.

Investing.com – DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock was down 3% in Thursday’s premarket trading amid increasing uncertainty on how long the housing boom will continue.
Inventories at the U.S.’ s largest homebuilder rose in the second quarter and the company said it is deliberately selling homes later in the construction cycle “when we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers.”
As of the end of June, the company had 47,300 homes in inventory, of which 15,400 were unsold. Completed units out of the company’s unsold homes numbered 500.
At the same time last year, the company had 32,800 homes in inventory, of which 12,700 were unsold.
Homebuilders like DR Horton and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) have had a record year as demand for housing boomed. As the economy expanded and working from home went mainstream, people looked for permanent, bigger and more suitable housing. Low interest rates fueled demand, meanwhile.
That party may be coming to an end after housing prices hit a 30-year high.  
The company’s financial year runs October to September and it now expects to close the year with consolidated revenue of $27.6 billion to $28.1 billion. It had last October guided this to come between $24 billion and $25 billion.
The company posted consolidated revenue of $20.3 billion in the last financial year.
Consolidated revenue in the third quarter rose 35% year-on-year to $7.28 billion. Adjusted profit per share was up 78% at $3.06.

186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 07:09AM ET</span>",China Weighs Unprecedented Penalty for Didi After U.S. IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese regulators are considering serious, perhaps unprecedented, penalties for Didi Global Inc. after its controversial initial public offering last month, according to people familiar with the matter.
Regulators see the ride-hailing giant’s decision to go public despite pushback from the Cyberspace Administration of China as a challenge to Beijing’s authority, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Officials from the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Natural Resources, along with tax, transport and antitrust regulators, began an investigation on-site at the company’s offices, the cyberspace watchdog said in a statement.
Regulators are weighing a range of potential punishments, including a fine, suspension of certain operations or the introduction of a state-owned investor, the people said. Also possible is a forced delisting or withdrawal of Didi’s U.S. shares, although it’s unclear how such an option would play out.
Deliberations are at a preliminary phase and the outcomes are far from certain. Beijing is likely to impose harsher sanctions on Didi than on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., which swallowed a record $2.8 billion fine after a months-long antitrust investigation and agreed to initiate measures to protect merchants and customers, the people said.
“It’s hard to guess what the penalty will be, but I’m sure it will be substantial,” said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California.
Didi’s stock dropped more than 3% in premarket trading.
Didi, the CAC, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Didi’s IPO looked at first like a great success, raising $4.4 billion after several troubled years. It turned co-founder Cheng Wei into a billionaire and rewarded long-time backers SoftBank Group Corp., Tiger Global Management and Temasek Holdings Pte.
But the CAC pounced just days later, announcing a cybersecurity review because of the company’s data practices and then banning Didi’s app from the country’s app stores. Its shares quickly plunged below the offering price.
China’s regulators largely supported the idea of an IPO, but they expressed concerns about Didi’s data security practices since at least April, the people said. In one example of concern, Didi had disclosed statistics on taxi trips taken by government officials, one of the people said, although it’s not clear whether that specific issue was raised with the company.
Regulators urged Didi to ensure the security of its data before proceeding with the IPO or to shift the location to Hong Kong or mainland China where disclosure risks would be lower, the people said. Regulators didn’t explicitly forbid the company from going public in the U.S., but they felt certain Didi understood the official instructions, they said.
One person involved in the meetings, when asked why Didi didn’t act on suggestions from regulators, referred to a proverb that you can’t wake a person pretending to sleep.
The CAC itself has come under scrutiny because of the Didi IPO, with a top Party official having questioned why the agency hadn’t blocked the company’s offering, one of the people said.
Some regulatory officials expressed in private that they think Didi may have rushed its IPO out before China unveiled a new web security law, which could have hurt its valuation, one of the people said. Just days after the offering, China proposed new rules that would require nearly all companies seeking to list in foreign countries to undergo a CAC cybersecurity review.
“Beijing wants the internet sector to understand that cybersecurity and data security are now among the government’s top priorities, and individual companies’ profit can be sacrificed when cybersecurity and data security may be exposed to risks,” said Feng Chucheng, an analyst with consultancy Plenum in Beijing.
Xi Jinping’s government is trying to strike a delicate balance between reining in the power of China’s tech giants without inflicting serious damage on a critical sector that has bolstered economic growth. The crackdown began last year when Beijing forced Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. to call off what would have been the world’s largest-ever IPO.
That was followed by antitrust investigations into giants from food-delivery pioneer Meituan to Alibaba, also founded by Ma. Beijing has said it wants to stop powerful tech companies from abusing their power and crushing innovative upstarts.
Didi began discussing IPO plans with its bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) late last year, said people directly involved. The company weighed whether to go public in Hong Kong or the U.S., and was seeking a valuation of as much as $100 billion.
By March, they had homed in on the U.S. because the listing rules were more amenable and the company expected a better valuation from investors familiar with its American counterpart, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. The Hong Kong exchange also questioned Didi’s compliance with Chinese regulations. It didn’t have licenses to operate in certain cities and many of its drivers lacked a household registration, or hukou, for the cities where they lived, part of municipal requirements for providing on-demand ride-hailing services there.
The process turned unusually chaotic in June as Didi and its bankers raced to the finish line, said people directly involved. As the company prepared to make its first public filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, its own bankers weren’t sure when the documents would land. The filing ultimately hit about 3:45 a.m. China time the morning of June 11.
Didi’s government relations team handled discussions with the CAC and its regulators, and management relayed the content of those talks to its bankers, the people said. Didi knew the CAC had concerns about its data practices, but executives did not think the agency had forbidden them to proceed, the people said.
Cheng, President Jean Liu, investors and their bankers faced the choice of erring on the side of caution or proceeding with an offering that would fill the company’s coffers and enrich all of them. On June 28, they gave the green light.
Didi told its bankers it was allowed to go public provided the company keep a very low profile, one of the people said, adding that the bookrunners were told by the company there would be no press release to announce the IPO. Didi didn’t even publicize to its own employees its impending New York listing -- a landmark for the still-young company -- until the last minute. Near midnight on June 30, the company posted an announcement on an internal forum, another person said.
On Thursday, July 1, Didi’s shares surged about 16%, signaling robust investor demand. By Friday, Didi’s management began to relax and celebrate.
That evening, after 7 p.m. China time, the CAC posted a notice on its website: The agency would begin an investigation into Didi to safeguard national security and protect the public interest.
Later that night, Didi issued a public statement saying it would fully cooperate with the government review.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Former top U.S. consumer regulator joins crypto risk monitoring firm,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency startup Solidus Labs has hired the former director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as its top regulatory official, she told Reuters.
Kathy Kraninger is the latest former Trump administration official to land in the booming digital currency industry as it beefs up on legal expertise and Washington connections amid increasing regulatory scrutiny.
Founded in 2017 by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) employees, New York-based Solidus Labs provides cryptocurrency trading surveillance and risk monitoring tools. Its backers include private equity firms Evolution Equity Partners and Hanaco Ventures. 
Kraninger will lead and build out Solidus Labs' regulatory team, spending most of her time working with regulators, U.S. lawmakers and traditional institutions to explain how digital markets can be effectively policed, she said in an interview.
Her career in government, including helping to set up the Department of Homeland Security and leading the CFPB from 2018 to 2021, positions her to contribute to a growing debate in Washington over how to regulate cryptocurrencies, she said. 
""Bringing the expertise that I have from how federal regulators think, state regulators think ... it just seemed to be a fantastic fit,"" said Kraninger.
Solidus Labs has built software to monitor crypto markets and help investment firms and other clients screen for manipulation, bad actors and meet compliance obligations. Its clients include crypto exchange Bittrex and Rialto Markets. 
The ability to monitor cryptocurrencies has become a major worry for regulators as the ballooning market, which reached a record $2 trillion capitalization in April, has experienced wild volatility.
In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) again delayed approving a bitcoin exchange traded fund and sought feedback on the risks of market manipulation. 
This month, Senator Elizabeth Warren called for increased cryptocurrency oversight, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators they must quickly establish rules for digital coins linked to fiat currencies, known as stablecoins. 
Regulators worry the cryptocurrency market is unstable, opaque and systemically risky.

""We've had overwhelming interest from regulatory entities globally,"" said Solidus Labs Chief Executive Asaf Meir. ""We needed someone who brings in the right experience."" 
Crypto and fintech companies have been snapping up former Trump regulators. Former bank regulator Brian Brooks was appointed Binance's U.S. CEO in May, while Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the U.S. derivatives regulator, is an investor in Solidus and founded the Digital Dollar Project which advocates for U.S. policymakers to develop a digital dollar.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, buoyed by signs of a strong corporate earnings season ahead of the release of key unemployment data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 90 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 24 points, or 0.2%.
The major equity indices closed higher Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost 300 points, or 0.8%, the S&P 500 rising 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite rising 0.9%. Adding to Tuesday’s gains, this means Wall Street had erased all of Monday’s substantial losses.
Helping the market recover has been a strong start to the quarterly earnings season. According to data from Refinitiv, 15% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings to date, with 88% beating earnings estimates.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) reported a positive second quarter late Wednesday, helped by a more than 40% rise in revenue, but the chipmaker’s stock is seen falling sharply Thursday amid concerns that demand for silicon chips is peaking.
Dow (NYSE:DOW) stock is seen higher premarket after the chemicals company said its second-quarter profit doubled from the prior period, helped by strong consumer and industrial demand as the economy reopened.
Reports from the likes of AT&T (NYSE:T), D.R. Horton (SA:D1HI34) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are due before the opening bell, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are due to offer up quarterly updates after the market closes.
Also of interest Thursday will be the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). These are seen at 350,000, down just 10,000 from the previous week, amid fears that the rise in Covid cases could be slowing the recovery in the jobs market.
Elsewhere, oil prices traded higher Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s strong recovery despite a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The crude market has been very volatile this week, plunging on Monday on worries over rising Covid cases and an agreement between top producers to add supply, before rebounding over the last two days. 
U.S. crude inventories rose by just over 2 million barrels during the week ended July 16, the Energy Information Administration said late Wednesday, snapping a run of eight weeks of declines. 
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $71.09 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $72.96. Both contracts gained over 4% on Wednesday.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 06:43AM ET</span>","Flush from Reddit rally, GameStop plots store revival","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Jessica DiNapoli and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - When  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares surged by more than 2,500% in January, some customers joked to store staff they should thank the investors who fueled the video game retailer's extraordinary rally for their paychecks.
Employees such as Gianna Pandiscio-Ferrero were not amused. The 19 year-old high-school graduate told Reuters that, like many GameStop store employees, she worked part-time without healthcare benefits and earned barely more than the minimum wage - $7.50 per hour in Virginia, where she was based at the time. 
The COVID-19 pandemic hit GameStop, like other retailers, hard, as all non-essential stores were closed in March 2020 and reopened selectively months later.
Despite this, GameStop capitalized on the stock trading frenzy driven by Reddit and other social media platforms earlier this year by selling more than $1.7 billion of new shares to investors. Little of that windfall has made its way to its run-down stores that have been losing customers to e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and discount retailers, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
GameStop's largest shareholder, Ryan Cohen, joined its board in January and became chairman last month with a plan to revive stores and boost online sales.
Three people with first-hand knowledge of his strategy said he plans to breathe life into the stores by investing in what customers want and improving how employees can serve them.
To better understand the situation, Cohen has been turning up in stores around the United States unannounced, or ""ghost-shopping"", the sources said, asking not to be named. 
The previously unreported plans for GameStop's stores will run in tandem with the company's push into e-commerce, they said.
A spokesperson for GameStop and Cohen declined to comment.
STAGNANT PAY, DWINDLING HOURS
Cohen faces an uphill struggle to reverse the fortunes of the stores, current and former GameStop employees said in interviews.
Pandiscio-Ferrero said morale was low among store workers because their pay had become unreliable. She quit because of this in April, after six months on the job.
""We got our hours cut to the point where it was only the manager and assistant manager working by themselves for about three weeks,"" she said.
DJ Hill, the manager of a GameStop store in a strip mall close to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, resigned in June after 18 years with the company, because he didn't like the direction in which the company was heading. He said the stores no longer attracted the regular customers he used to enjoy chatting with.
GameStop, Hill said, judged store associates on how many rewards cards, warranties and reservations for future game and console releases they sold, and had barely increased his $17.50-per-hour pay in the last three years. 
FROM PETS TO GAMES
Cohen is undaunted. He is seeking to repeat his success with online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), which he sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017. He wants to turn GameStop into a gaming and entertainment retailer or the ""Chewy of gaming"", with lower prices, better selection and faster delivery times on online orders than its rivals.
But unlike Chewy, which only operates online, GameStop generates most of its revenue in its stores. With its success in e-commerce uncertain, pressure has mounted on GameStop to fix them. Over the last 15 months, it has closed 811 stores, leaving it with about 3,000 U.S. stores and 1,600 stores abroad. 
Graphic: GameStop U.S. stores & international locations - https://graphics.reuters.com/GAMESTOP-STORES/egpbknngmvq/chart.png 
Cohen has made unannounced visits to about a dozen GameStop stores, mostly without being recognized, the sources said. Several employees said in interviews that they have never heard of the 35-year old executive, asking if he is an actor or maybe a rock star.
In one instance, he dropped in on a GameStop store in a mall in Arlington, Virginia, in May dressed in black pants, a black puffer jacket, and a black face mask.
Cohen was often infuriated by the dusty shelves and empty racks he found, as well as by some employees who did not greet customers properly or offer to help them, the sources said. The ""only differentiator"" for GameStop was customer service and that needed to improve, Cohen has told executives and staff.
He added that he was more bullish about the stores and had earmarked some of GameStop's stock market windfall for redesigning and restocking stores and training staff, the sources said.
Cohen plans to improve the customer experience by filling stores with the basics and the most popular items plus creating sections to cater to specific categories of customers, from video game fanatics to mothers seeking puzzles for their children, the sources said. 
GameStop also plans to extend opening hours into the evening to serve gamers who tend to be night owls, and is offering to match the price of goods at Amazon and Walmart, if customers find them cheaper there, the sources said. 
The Grapevine, Texas-based company, which is debt-free after its capital raises, also plans to hire new people at the stores and meet long-standing requests by many store managers for refurbishment, the sources said. Since Cohen's arrival, GameStop's board and executive ranks have been overhauled and these newcomers are concentrating on the stores.
CAN HE DO IT?
Some retail industry veterans are skeptical the turnaround plan will work.
Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada who is not related to Ryan Cohen, said it would be hard for GameStop to reverse the trend of most video games being bought or downloaded online. 
""It is an irrevocable move to technology-based acquisition of products. These folks (at GameStop) are not likely to be successful in the mid to longer term,"" he said. 
Most Wall Street analysts share these concerns, saying the so-called meme stock rally has massively over-valued GameStop. Its market capitalization has surged to nearly $15 billion from a little over $1 billion at the beginning of January. 
Another challenge for GameStop is that it ships a lot of inventory for its online orders from its stores, the sources said, which can add days and even weeks to delivery times.
To aid distribution, it is starting to lease warehouses, following a strategy familiar to the dozens of Amazon veterans Ryan Cohen has recruited - including its new CEO Matt Furlong. 
In the last few weeks, it has signed up leases for a 530,000-square-foot facility in Reno, Nevada, and a 700,000-square-foot facility in York, Pennsylvania. 
GameStop also plans to bring customer service by telephone, chat or other electronic means in-house after relying heavily on call centers in the Philippines and Mexico, the sources said. 
It is close to signing a lease on a 30,000-square-foot call center space in southern Florida, they said.
Kelli Durkin, a former vice president of customer service at Chewy who Cohen tapped to overhaul GameStop's customer service, plans to expand her team from 60 to about 200 people by the fourth quarter of this year, the people familiar with the plans said.
Cohen has asked Durkin's team to train customer service representatives on how to listen to customers, the sources said.
The micro-managing goes as far as instructing customer service representatives not to use phrases such as ""no problem"" or ""no worries"", which can have negative connotations.

While Cohen sees these changes as necessary to adjust to the changing landscape, Hill, the former store manager, said some of them will make it less appealing for workers to pursue careers with the retailer.
""This company used to be a fun company to work at,"" Hill said. ""I would like to see them succeed. At the same time, get out if you can.""

Officials say vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant, now the dominant variant worldwide, though the study reiterated that one shot of the vaccines is not enough for high protection.
The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms headline findings given by Public Health England in May about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca, based on real-world data.
Wednesday's study found that two doses of Pfizer's shot was 88% effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, compared to 93.7% against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as previously reported. 
Two shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective against the Delta variant, up from 60% originally reported, and 74.5% effective against the Alpha variant, compared to an original estimate of 66% effectiveness.
""Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the Delta variant as compared with the Alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses,"" Public Health England researchers wrote in the study.
Data from Israel has estimated lower effectiveness of Pfizer's shot against symptomatic disease, although protection against severe disease remains high.
PHE had previously said that a first dose of either vaccine was around 33% effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant.

The full study published on Wednesday found that one dose of Pfizer's shot was 36% effective, and one dose of AstraZeneca's vaccine was around 30% effective.
""Our finding of reduced effectiveness after the first dose would support efforts to maximise vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable groups in the context of circulation of the Delta variant,"" the authors of the study said.

(Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will most likely restart accepting bitcoin as payments once it conducts due diligence on the amount of renewable energy used to mine the currency, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said at a conference on Wednesday.
Bitcoin was up 8% at $32,160.16, while ether surged 11.6% to $1,993.36. Tesla's shares were down 0.8% at $655.30 in extended trading.
Musk's comments at the B Word conference come after Tesla said in May it would stop accepting bitcoin for car purchases, less than two months after the company began accepting the world's biggest digital currency for payment.
""I wanted a little bit more due diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50%, and that there is a trend towards increasing that number, and if so Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin"" Musk said.
""Most likely the answer is that Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin.""
The use of bitcoin to buy Tesla's electric vehicles had highlighted a dichotomy between Musk's reputation as an environmentalist and the use of his popularity and stature as one of the world's richest people to back cryptocurrencies. 
Some Tesla investors, along with environmentalists, have been increasingly critical about the way bitcoin is ""mined"" using vast amounts of electricity generated with fossil fuels.
More digital currency miners, however, are making attempts to use renewable energy to mitigate the impact on the environment. 
""Tesla's mission is accelerating the advent of sustainable energy. We can't be the company that does that and also not do appropriate diligence on the energy usage of bitcoin,"" Musk said.

Musk added that he personally owned bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin, apart from bitcoin that Tesla and SpaceX owned.
""I might pump, but I don't dump,"" Musk said. ""I definitely do not believe in getting the price high and selling ... I would like to see bitcoin succeed.""

The U.S. budget carrier has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the easing of coronavirus curbs as it mainly caters to the domestic market, unlike larger rivals who fly transatlantic routes and are struggling due to international border restrictions.
That has propelled Southwest's market value to more than $31 billion as of Wednesday's close, above Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), whose value has fallen by about a third to $26.6 billion from two years ago. 
Delta last week posted a smaller quarterly adjusted loss and also said it expects to remain profitable for the rest of 2021.
Southwest said it stopped burning cash in June, with an average core cash flow of about $4 million per day for the month. Its average core cash burn was about $1 million per day in the second quarter, down from about $13 million per day in the first quarter.
June leisure passenger traffic rose above June 2019 levels while passenger fares were on par with the same period two years ago, Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said, adding that the company expected to see further improvement in July. 
Southwest said it now expects July operating revenue to drop between 10% and 15% compared with the same period in 2019, an improvement from its prior forecast of a fall between 15% and 20%. 
The company expects August operating revenue to decline between 12% and 17% from two years earlier.

Excluding items, Dallas-based Southwest's net loss narrowed to $206 million, or 35 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $1.50 billion, or $2.67 per share, a year earlier.
Total operating revenue rose nearly 300% to $4 billion from a year earlier, but fell about 32% from 2019.

Investing.com –  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) stock was down 0.4% in Thursday’s premarket trading after a shortage of parts due to the pandemic forced it to announce the suspension of partial operations at a plant for a few days in July and August.
The company said it will suspend production at line number 2 at its Fujimatsu plant for five days in July and August combined. Operations will remain suspended from July 29-30 and August 2-4.
The affected line makes Toyota’s Alphard, Vellfire, Noah, Voxy and Esquire vehicles.
The latest production curtailment is in addition to the suspension of production at one line in its Takaoka plant. That will last August 2-6 and will affect the carmaker’s Corolla and Corolla Touring vehicles, according to the company’s July 16 note.
Several countries in southeast Asia, a large manufacturing hub for ancillaries and automobiles, have been affected by a resurgent coronavirus, mostly the Delta variant.
As a result, fresh cases have risen again and lockdowns are back. This has forced several manufacturers to shut or curtail operations. Last week, two Vietnamese suppliers to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) halted production. Toyota rival Honda also announced disruption to production earlier this week.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Engineering company ABB doubled its full year sales guidance on Thursday thanks to resurgent global industrial demand and said it is forging ahead with plans to float its fast growing electric vehicle charging business next year.
The factory drives and robot maker reported better than expected second quarter results and said double-digit order growth was seen in all its business areas as customers rebuilt their inventories.
Sales of its high-speed electric vehicle chargers for buses and cars have seen an average growth rate of 50% since 2016, benefiting from a global boom in battery-powered vehicles.
Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said the business could be listed early next year to help accelerate its growth.
""Demand is enormous and we don't expect it to go down,"" Rosengren said, adding that orders had more than doubled in the first half of 2021.
The potential IPO is the latest stage of the reorganisation Rosengren has undertaken at ABB since taking charge in March last year.
The former Sandvik boss's overhaul has been welcomed by investors, with ABB's stock gaining 1.8% on Thursday to reach its highest level since November 2007.
ABB plans to keep a stake in the electro-charging business- a similar strategy to German rival Siemens when it spun off its medical equipment business Healthineers.
Rosengren said ABB would likely keep a controlling stake and would be ready to engage with investors during the fourth quarter, with a potential IPO pencilled in for early next year.
A separately listed electric vehicle charging business would probably have a higher valuation multiple than ABB itself, Rosengren said, which could help it with acquisitions of both software and hardware companies and attract capital for quick growth.
Reuters has reported the business, which had sales of $220 million in 2020, could achieve a valuation at about $3 billion in a float.
To boost electric vehicle sales, Brussels earlier this month proposed legislation that would require countries to install public charging points no more than 60 kilometres (37.3 miles) apart on major roads by 2025.
Updating investors on the rest of ABB's divestment plans, Rosengren said an announcement on the sale of its Dodge clutch and transmission business would be made in the next few weeks.
The company's turbocharging business, also slated for exit, could be spun off in the second quarter of 2022, the CEO said.

Announcing its second quarter 2021 earnings, ABB said its revenues rose 21% from 2020's coronavirus driven nadir to reach $7.45 billion, beating estimates of $7.24 billion. Net profit rose 136% to $752 million.
ABB now expects full-year comparable revenues to rise by just below 10%, above its previous view for a 5% increase.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy British cross-border payments provider Currencycloud at a valuation of 700 million pounds ($962.01 million). 
Visa has been a Currencycloud shareholder since 2020, and the financial consideration will be reduced by the equity that the card network company already owns in the startup, the company said. 
Launched in 2012, Currencycloud facilitates cross-border payments for nearly 500 banking and technology companies, including well-known European fintechs Klarna, Monzo, Starling and Revolut. Since its launch it has moved more than $75 billion in payments to over 180 countries.
The deal comes less than a month after Visa announced it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink.
The aggressive acquisition strategy is part of Visa's push to diversify revenues beyond credit card payments, where it is one of the world's dominant players. Card companies have been facing increased pressure from regulators on fees, especially in Europe.
""The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,"" Colleen Ostrowski, Visa's Global Treasurer, said in a statement.
Currencycloud will maintain its management team and continue to operate from its London headquarters. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Other Currencycloud backers included BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA, SBI Group, Siam Commercial Bank (OTC:SMUUY), Sapphire Ventures, Notion Capital and GV, formerly Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures.

Investing.com – Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock slipped more than 4% in Thursday’s premarket trading amid concerns that demand for silicon chips is peaking.
The company said on Wednesday it expected sales to stagnate or decline a little in the current quarter, and management was evasive when asked on an earnings call if it thought its recent strong growth is susainable. 
The chipmaker expects sales in the September quarter to come between $4.4 billion and $4.76 billion. Earnings per share is likely to be $1.87 to $2.13, the company said Wednesday while announcing its second-quarter results.
According to a poll by Bloomberg, analysts predicted profit of $1.97 a share and sales of $4.59 billion.
Bloomberg said the company’s management sidestepped repeated attempts by analysts to get its view on whether chip demand is peaking.
“Our job isn’t to predict the future, it’s to prepare the company so we can handle anything and we’ve done that,” Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi told the wire service.
Texas, like other chipmakers, benefitted immensely from the emergence of work-from-home phenomenon that the pandemic forced on the people. Demand for mobiles, laptops, printers and several other digital gadgets boomed, and along with that, the demand for chips that go into them.
As offices open and a more blended form of home-office work takes over, many believe peak demand may be behind or nearing and thus the best of times for chipmakers like Texas Instruments may be over.
According to data from Susquehanna Research, it may be too early to say that though. The data shows that delivery lead times for chips are still growing.
Texas second-quarter revenue rose 41% year-on-year to $4.58 billion and EPS rose 39% to $2.05.
Demand from industrial, automotive and personal electronics industries was strong, driving revenue growth of 42% and 43% respectively in its two key businesses of analog and embedded processing chips.

LONDON (Reuters) - Silicon Valley Bank aims to hire around 150 staff in Europe this year, mainly in Britain, as it looks to capitalise on frenzied demand for investment in tech and innovation companies, its head for the region told Reuters.
The Santa Clara, California based lender is recruiting for bankers who can help it connect mainly U.S. investors with tech start-ups in markets such as Britain, Germany and Israel, said Erin Platts, President of the bank's UK branch.
""We've found the sheer abundance of capital domestically and in Europe chasing innovation businesses, coupled with the quality of companies we are seeing, means there is just massive demand going into the sector,"" she said.
The bank is also recruiting support staff in finance, risk and compliance functions as it converts its UK branch into a full subsidiary, she added.
The hiring spree stands in contrast to many British-based rivals that are cutting costs and trimming headcount, and follows on from a similar recruiting drive last year also reported by Reuters.
Platt said the bank is comfortable with its hiring plans despite concerns among some investors about sky-high valuations in the sector.
""The high levels of liquidity in the sector is going to mask some mediocre performance among some companies in the next 12-24 months... there will undoubtedly be some bumps and bruises but the size of the market is massive and it can cope,"" she said.
The bank specialises in helping tech companies with early stage funding, providing capital for a number of such firms that have listed in recent months including Trustpilot, Made.com and Wise.
The listing of payments company Wise earlier this month at a valuation of $11 billion made it London's biggest ever tech listing and capped a record-breaking run for such fundraising in Britain.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's antitrust regulator has accused Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) of concealing facts and making false submissions when it sought approval for a 2019 investment in a Future Group unit, a letter to the U.S. e-commerce giant seen by Reuters showed.
The letter complicates Amazon's bitter legal battle with Future Group over the Indian's firm's decision to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries - a matter that is now before India's Supreme Court. 
Amazon has argued that terms agreed upon in its 2019 deal to pay $192 million for a 49% stake in Future's gift voucher unit prevent its parent, Future Group, from selling its Future Retail Ltd business to Reliance. 
In the letter dated June 4, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said Amazon hid factual aspects of the transaction by not revealing its strategic interest in Future Retail when it sought approval for the 2019 deal.
""The representations and conduct of Amazon before the Commission amounts to misrepresentation, making false statement and suppression or/and concealment of material facts,"" the letter said. It also noted that its review of the submissions made had been prompted by a complaint from Future Group.
In the four-page letter, a so-called 'show cause notice', the CCI asked Amazon why it should not take action and penalise the company for providing false information.
Amazon has yet to respond, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the letter has not been made public.
Amazon said in a statement to Reuters it had received a letter, was committed to complying with India's laws and would extend its full cooperation to the CCI. 
""We are confident that we will be able to address the CCI’s concerns,"" it said. 
Representatives for Future and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Vaibhav Choukse, a competition law specialist and partner at J. Sagar Associates, said it was rare for the CCI to issue such a notice and that if the CCI was not satisfied by Amazon's response, it could lead to a fine and even a review of the deal.
""The CCI has wide powers which includes directions to re-file the approval application and even revoke the approval under exceptional circumstances,"" Choukse said.
The CCI's 2019 approval order states its decision ""shall stand revoked if, at any time, the information provided"" is found to be incorrect.
Shares in Future Retail jumped after Reuters published details of the letter, extending gains to be up nearly 5% in Thursday afternoon trade.
SUBMISSIONS COMPARED
The dispute over Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 supermarket and other outlets, is the most hostile flashpoint between Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, as they try to gain the upper hand in winning over the country's consumers.
Amazon also has a host of other challenges in India, a key growth market where it has committed $6.5 billion in investments, including a separate CCI probe into alleged practices that small businesses say have hurt them. 
In addition, it faces the prospect of more regulations that would restrict the sale of private labels and would prohibit the U.S. firm from allowing its affiliates to list products on its website.
The CCI letter compared three sets of submissions Amazon made to it in 2019 with submissions made later to other legal forums, saying they were ""contradictory.""
In particular, it said Amazon had explained its interest in investing in Future's coupon unit as one that would address gaps in India's payments industry. But the letter stated Amazon had disclosed in other legal forums that the foundation of its relationship with Future Coupon was certain special rights it obtained over Future Retail.

""Amazon has concealed its strategic interest"" in Future Retail, the letter said, adding: ""Such interest and the purpose of the combination ... was not disclosed to the Commission despite specific requirements."" 
The CCI also objected to one section of a submission where Amazon had told the regulator it had nothing to do with one particular legal agreement that two Future entities had signed between themselves days ahead of its 2019 deal. But Amazon later claimed before an arbitrator that the agreement was an ""integrated part"" of the transaction, the letter said.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed largely higher Thursday, helped by some strong corporate earnings ahead of the latest policy announcement by the European Central Bank.
At 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was largely flat.
This positive start follows on from gains in Asia as well as on Wall Street overnight, rebounding from Monday’s rout on fears the rising Covid cases, starting in Asia and moving into Europe and the U.S., would derail the global economic recovery.
Helping stock markets recover have been generally positive corporate results as the start of the new quarterly earnings season. 
Publicis (PA:PUBP) stock rose 2.5% after the French advertising giant reported strong second-quarter growth, adding that its financials would make a full return to pre-pandemic levels this year.
ABB (SIX:ABBN) stock rose 1.5% after the engineering company doubled its full-year sales outlook, in the latest sign of a global manufacturing revival. It also said it's considering a spin-off of its fast-growing unit for charging electric vehicles. 
Unilever (NYSE:UL) reported higher-than-expected underlying sales growth for the second quarter, but its stock fell 4% after it warned of surging commodity costs that ate into margins. Workspace (LON:WKP) stock 1.9% after the office-space provider said it was witnessing demand at pre-pandemic levels.
Aside from earnings, the main focus of investors Thursday will be on the European Central Bank's policy-setting decision, due at 7:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), and the subsequent press conference from President Christine Lagarde.
The central bank recently changed its inflation target, and investors will be looking to see if this changes the course of its monetary policy, particularly after Lagarde earlier this week said the meeting will have “some interesting variations and changes”.
“We think that the ECB will strengthen its forward guidance to signal a longer period of unchanged policy rates and net purchases under the APP [Asset Purchase Program] than markets currently expect,” said Nick Kounis, Head of Financial Markets Research at ABN Amro, in a note.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s despite strong gains after a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The crude market has been very volatile this week, plunging on Monday on worries over rising Covid cases and an agreement between top producers to add supply, before rebounding over the last two days. 
U.S. crude inventories rose by just over 2 million barrels during the week ended July 16, the Energy Information Administration said late Wednesday, snapping a run of eight weeks of declines. 
At 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $70.56 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $72.50. Both contracts gained over 4% on Wednesday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,794.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1784."

Generali's CEO Philippe Donnet, whose mandate comes to an end in spring next year, is due to present a new business plan in December.
Italian businessmen Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, together with Edizione, the holding company of the powerful Benetton family, and banking foundation Fondazione CRT, are preparing to ask Donnet not to submit his new strategic plan, the paper said. 
Tensions among investors in Italy's largest insurer have been rising before the renewal of the board next year.
Caltagirone, whose business empire spans construction to publishing, is the second-largest shareholder in Generali. He recently raised his stake in Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Generali's top investor with a 13% stake.
The entrepreneur snubbed the company's annual general meeting in April in the first public sign that he is unhappy with the balance of power among shareholders, sources have said.
His twin investments in Mediobanca and Generali mirror those of fellow billionaire, Leonardo Del Vecchio, the 86 year-old founder of spectacles giant Luxottica and the third-largest investor in Generali. Del Vecchio has also been critical of some of the insurer's strategic moves in the past year. Earlier this month he raised his Mediobanca stake to 18.9%
Caltagirone, Leonardo del Vecchio and the Benetton family declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.

Fondazione CRT was not immediately available for comment.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Tata Group is taking a more vocal interest in rules shaping online marketplaces, hinting at ambitions as it reappraises its retail strategy just as e-commerce reform threatens to muddy plans.
The $106 billion conglomerate yet e-commerce minnow was far more vociferous in discussions than market leader Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) at a July 3 meeting with government officials about proposals such as the prohibition of sales of own-brand or affiliates' goods, attendees said.
The rules would greatly increase the compliance burden of a conglomerate's numerous entities and interests, and hurt them far more than smaller rivals, Tata Vice President Poornima Sampath told the online gathering, according to two attendees.
Tata declined to comment for this article. Sampath did not respond to a request for comment.
Two weeks earlier, the government spooked the industry by proposing increased scrutiny of relationships between online marketplace operators and their partners. The plan was widely regarded as an attempt to curb the dominance of Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart and support high-street shops.
The 153-year-old Tata conglomerate is ubiquitous on Indian high streets, so its voice in favour of e-commerce at the July 3 meeting indicates the degree to which it is changing tack.
The firm is arguably best known internationally as owner of British luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover, but it also makes cars at home under its own brand. The group is also active in steelmaking, IT outsourcing, and hotel and airline operation.
In retail, Tata has an expansive offline portfolio including a joint venture with cafe operator  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and stores it operates for  Inditex  (MC:ITX) fashion brand Zara. Yet it is a minor player online - a situation it is determined to rectify, said five people with direct knowledge of its plans.
It bought the majority of online grocer BigBasket in May for over $1 billion and in June took control of online pharmacy 1mg. They will likely join other marquee brands on an app that Tata aims to pilot this year, said three of the people.
E-commerce is the next big thing for Tata, and with that in mind, it plans to buy many more brands, said one of the people.
None of the sources were authorised to speak publicly so declined to be identified.
TATA APP
Tata's latest digital push is not its first. It launched its Tata CliQ online marketplace in 2016, which booked sales of $36 million in 2019-20. Yet that compared with roughly $10 billion at Amazon, which has invested billions of dollars in India.
Still, in an e-commerce market widely projected to be worth $200 billion by 2026, there is plenty of space for Tata to grow.
Through its app, Tata plans to bring its brands together to offer services such as grocery shopping, meal and medicine delivery, sales of electronic products plus online fitness packages, people familiar with its plans said. 
Tata is still developing the app's features and determining a go-to-market strategy, with the launch likely in phases, starting with some large cities, said one of the people.
Another said the pilot could begin as early as September in the southern city of Bengaluru, India's IT hub.
Spearheading the app is Tata Digital Chief Executive Pratik Pal, who gained extensive experience with retailers in 28 years at IT outsourcing unit Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
Yet digitally integrating the multitude of businesses at a conglomerate the size of Tata Group is a daunting task, said Keyur Majmudar, a managing partner at India's Bay Capital, adding that retaining customers on a super app will be tough when there is a rise in several niche e-commerce players.
""They need a radical shift in thinking. That (digital integration) is something they've never done before. So, the jury is still out,"" he said.
Pal declined to comment.
Just as Tata's new digital strategy gathers pace with acquisitions and app development, the government has sprung a surprise that may mean a rethink before the app is even piloted.
A ban on marketplaces offering affiliates' products could bar its Croma electronics chain and Starbucks from Tata sites, Sampath said at the July 3 meeting, according to two attendees.

A ban on sales of own-brand goods has also triggered questions about whether it will be able to retail its household names such as Tata Tea or Tata Salt on its e-commerce platform.
The Tata brand name adds a level of assurance for consumers, Sampath objected at the meeting, seeking clarity on the government's policy plans, attendees said.

The central bank in February banned  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) from trading Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards and suspended it for two years from trading forex derivatives as part of a crackdown on speculation.
In addition to Deutsche Bank's punishment, the central bank also said that ING and ANZ's Taipei offices would not be allowed to trade Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards for nine months.
But two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that ING and ANZ have been allowed to resume Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards trades since earlier this month, shortening their punishment time.
An ING spokesperson confirmed the suspension had been lifted.
Neither the central bank nor ANZ responded to requests for comment.
The sources said that the central bank had told the banks at the time they were punished that they could apply for an early lifting of the restrictions if they could show the central bank they had carried out ""improvement measures"".

The central bank had previously said the cases centred on grains trading companies ostensibly carrying out routine currency transactions for their business, which had in fact been engaging in currency speculation, affecting the stability of Taiwan's foreign exchange market.
Taiwan has been concerned about the strength of its local dollar, which could make exports from the trade-dependent island more expensive and possibly put it in the crosshairs of the United States as a manipulator.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to edge higher at the open Thursday, continuing the recovery from the sharp selloff at the start of the week ahead of the latest policy announcement by the European Central Bank.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
This positive start follows on from gains in Asia as well as on Wall Street overnight, rebounding from Monday’s rout on fears the rising Covid cases caused by the highly-transmissible delta variant, starting in Asia and moving into Europe and the U.S., would derail the global economic recovery.

Getlink, which operates the undersea railway tunnel that connects France with Britain, posted a net loss of 123 million euros ($145 million) on Thursday, compared with a loss of 79 million euros in the same period of 2020.
The number of passengers crossing the Eurotunnel aboard its shuttles and on Eurostar trains plunged during the first half of the year, as governments extended travel restrictions to try and control the spread of more contagious variants of the coronavirus.
Fewer logistics trucks also made the passage due to companies stockpiling ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union, though traffic picked up again in the second quarter.
Getlink's revenues and core profit fell 12% and 19% respectively - although both exceeded the expectations of analysts polled by the company, while its cash position hit new highs on the back of tight cost controls.
""In this context I would call our results satisfactory,"" Getlink's CEO Yann Leriche told reporters, adding that Getlink was investing in digitalising formerly manual border controls in order to make the crossing more efficient.
""We're preparing for a rise in traffic,"" he said. ""We've seen this last year and we've seen it this year - as soon as travel restrictions ease people quickly make a lot of bookings with us.""
However, the group said it could not give financial guidance while governments did not give a stable timeframe on a return to cross-border travel.

To contain a fourth coronavirus wave, the French government has announced tough new measures, including requiring a health pass on long-distance trains, while Britain last week extended quarantine rules for travellers from France.

(Reuters) - France's Publicis said on Thursday its financials would make a full return to pre-pandemic levels this year, after its second-quarter organic growth exceeded market expectations and 2019 levels.
The world's third-largest advertising group behind Britain's WPP (LON:WPP) and U.S.-based Omnicom was last year hit by a market-wide depletion of revenue streams as its clients cut advertising budgets to wade through the COVID-19 crisis.
Publicis, which has wooed new customers by promising targeted campaigns based on large pools of data, now expects to regain those losses a year earlier than anticipated. 
""We assume that the demand for data and direct consumer will not stop due to the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun told reporters.
Underlying sales in the United States, Publicis' biggest market and the source of more than half of its revenues, grew 15.2% in the three months to June, steered by strong performances from its digital business Sapient and data company Epsilon, up 27% and 31% respectively.
""When we see the growth rates we have seen with Epsilon and Sapient, we are confident in our ability to deliver,"" Sadoun said.
On group level, quarterly underlying sales increased 17.1% to 2.54 billion euros ($3.00 billion), beating analysts' estimate of 12.9% organic growth. They also grew 2% from two years ago.
Publicis, home to ad agencies such as Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, said the ""overperformance"" was thanks to a new acceleration in the United States and continued growth in Asia. Both regions saw a 7% growth from 2019.
Europe, mirroring the lifting of lockdowns, grew 23% from the low base level last year, but still lagging the pre-pandemic level.
Growth in the first half was boosted by a strong run of new business wins, such as Stellantis' global media and Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s shopper marketing in the United States, the company said.

It forecast organic growth of 7% for the full year, with a 17% operating margin.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 01:26AM ET</span>","Facebook decided faith groups are good for business. Now, it wants your prayers","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has long sought your attention. In recent weeks, it has started asking for your prayers as well in a new tool now available for U.S. Facebook Groups.
The prayer feature is part of Facebook's recent and concerted outreach to the religious community, which it is speaking about in detail to media for the first time. Facebook sees worshippers as a vital community to drive engagement on the world's largest social media platform. As early as 2017, CEO Mark Zuckerberg cited churches as one example in a lengthy manifesto on connecting the world and the company created a team focused on ""faith partnerships.""
COVID gave new urgency to the efforts, Facebook's head of faith partnerships Nona Jones told Reuters in an interview. The new prayers product was spun up after the company saw an increase in people asking each other for prayers during the pandemic, said Jones, who is also a pastor in Florida. 
The outreach culminated in the company holding its first virtual faith summit with religious leaders last month. During the live event broadcast on Facebook Live where the company played videos with heart emojis floating across the screen as religious leaders ministered to their congregations, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg discussed a future where leaders engaged worshippers with virtual reality tools and augmented reality. 
At the end of May, Facebook made its prayer tool, which it had been testing with some faith communities, accessible for all U.S. Facebook Groups to turn on. In one private Group seen by Reuters, a woman used the tool to request prayers for an aunt sick with coronavirus. People replied by clicking a button to say ""I prayed,"" and their names were counted underneath. Users could choose to be notified with a reminder to pray again tomorrow. Others requested prayers for a daughter's broken heart, a son's driving test and problems with an insurance company.
Jones confirmed prayer posts are used to personalize ads on Facebook, like other content. A spokesperson said the data could feed into how Facebook's machine learning systems decide which ads to show users. Advertisers will not be able to directly target ads based on the content of the prayer or use of the feature, the person said. The spokesperson also said prayer tool use would not be factored into the categories that ad buyers already use to slice up Facebook audiences based on a demonstrated interest in topics, like ""faith,"" or ""Catholic Church.""
""One of the biggest communities using Facebook products to connect are people of faith,"" said outgoing Facebook app head Fidji Simo, in a fireside chat at the summit, following panels with religious leaders and a session for spiritual breathwork, a breathing and meditation exercise.
""When I looked at the data of what was taking off during the pandemic, we were seeing massive growth in the spiritual category.""
Early in the pandemic, Facebook sent ""starter kits"" of equipment like small tripods and phone holders to faith groups for live-streaming and shooting content as places of worship closed down. It launched a faith resources website with e-learning courses and quizzes on best practices, touting that ""the people your house of worship wants to reach are on Facebook platforms already."" 
This year, it has started up an Interfaith Advisory Council to hold regular meetings with faith leaders and educators. As well as consulting religious leaders - who told Reuters their wish lists for the site included church planning tools and emojis showing more diverse forms of worship - Facebook has been picking the brains of organizations already running large online faith platforms like evangelical megachurch Life.Church, pastor Kyle Kutter said.
MIXED RECEPTION
While many religious leaders who spoke to Reuters welcomed Facebook's attention in a year when their communities were forced to stay at home, some Group users cited concerns over the privacy of prayer posts, questioning how their spiritual activities could be exploited online, or said they found it clinical.
Simcha Fisher, a member of a Catholic women's Facebook Group, said she had only seen the prayer post used by friends who noted it felt ""icky."" Her friend had compared Facebook to an overbearing parent getting involved in interactions occurring naturally on the platform: ""Anytime Facebook rolls out something new, you know it's because they're hoping to make money off it...to eventually sell you something, somehow,"" Fisher said.

Some religious leaders and Group members said they wanted to see the same level of commitment Facebook had shown in launching prayers to dealing with abuse targeted at their communities on the site. Khizer Subhani, who runs a Facebook Group for Muslims in the Bay Area which was given early access to the prayers feature, said he welcomed the company's focus but weighed it against his frustrations over Facebook's handling of hate speech around religious groups on the platform.
For Facebook, which faces attacks from global regulators and lawmakers, including over its track record of failing to curb harmful content like violent rhetoric and vaccine misinformation, connecting the faithful during a global pandemic is the kind of application it says it wants to double down on. Faith communities represent ""the best of Facebook and we hope to keep it that way, now and in the future,"" Sandberg said at the summit.

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group stocks soared, even as four of Hong Kong’s largest banks stopped providing mortgages to buyers of the company's unfinished apartments in the city and pressure mounts on founder Hui Ka Yan.
Evergrande's Hong Kong shares (HK:3333) were up 9.25% at HK$7.91 ($1.02) by 12:30 AM ET (4:30 AM GMT), even as its offshore notes due 2025 fell 2.6 cents on the dollar to 46.8 cents towards a record low as of 9:37 PM ET.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), Bank of China Ltd.’s Hong Kong unit, Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia (OTC:BKEAY) were reportedly among lenders that suspended new mortgages for two Evergrande projects currently under construction. The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (OTC:IDCBY) (Asia) is reportedly also on the list.
“It’s pretty clear that the market has already lost confidence, judging by both equity and bond prices,” said Jennifer James, a portfolio manager of emerging-market credit at Janus Henderson Investors, told Bloomberg.
“However, the company still has options,” said James, who holds a “tiny” position in Evergrande bonds. “In order to restore confidence, they need to accelerate asset sales and/or bring in a strategic investor.”
Evergrande said in a statement on Wednesday its relationships with many banks in Hong Kong means local operations will not be impacted. The developer remains confident that it can complete its Emerald Bay II development in August 2021 as scheduled and the Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX), its second project in Hong Kong, is targeted to finish by the end of October 2021.
Other options currently open to the company are accelerating asset sales or securing a bailout from the Chinese government. The government has made efforts in recent years to rein in moral hazard, but Evergrade could be a case of ‘too big to fail’. Although authorities have so far kept quiet about their plans, they could step in to control the mess.
“Evergrande’s liquidity is increasingly and from all fronts under pressure... this could pave the way for some form of restructuring or debt extension talks sooner than later,” SC Lowy chief executive officer Michel Lowy told Bloomberg.
On a more positive note, the company said earlier in the day that it resolved its legal dispute with China Guangfa Bank over an overdue CNY132 million, or $ 20.38 million, loan and that the two sides will deepen business cooperation."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) posted its highest ever quarterly profit on Thursday, as strong industrial demand and surging steel prices boosted its revenue.
The world's sixth-biggest steelmaker by production as of 2020 unveiled a plan to raise its annual steel production capacity to more than 60 million tonnes by 2030, from 46 million tonnes as of 2020. 
It also lifted its 2021 revenue target to 37 trillion won from 32.8 trillion won as it expects tight supply to continue for the rest of this year, especially in the domestic market, according to comments in its earnings call.
Consolidated operating profit came in at 2.2 trillion won ($1.91 billion) for April-June, matching a company forecast made earlier this month, and slightly beating market consensus of 2.1 trillion won, according to Refinitiv Smartestimate.
POSCO had reported about 170 billion won in operating profit a year earlier, when sales were hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Revenue rose 33% to 18.3 trillion won in the last quarter. 
Analysts expect steel demand to continue to outpace supply in the second half of this year in major markets such as the United States and Europe, driven by plans to boost infrastructure spending and cut carbon emissions, bolstering steel prices.

POSCO shares rose 2.7% after the quarterly numbers were published, while the wider market was up 1%.

One of the brokers told Reuters that Bank of East Asia (OTC:BKEAY) had taken a similar step.
The move by the banks emerged after a Chinese court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by Evergrande this week and a Chinese city regulator briefly suspended sales from two of its projects.
The three brokers said the banks had halted lending to two residential projects in Hong Kong that were scheduled for completion in August and October, but they said the banks were still lending for a third, completed Evergrande development.
More banks may follow suit, they added.
HSBC declined to comment while Standard Chartered did not respond to request for comment. Bank of East Asia said late Wednesday that approved applications will not be affected, and it is continuing to accept applications for loans where the funds are handed to the buyers once the flats are completed.
Evergrande said other banks were still approving mortgages for its off-plan units. It said it expected any decision by Hong Kong banks, which it did not name, to halt lending to have only a minor impact. It said its developments were on schedule.
Ivy Wong, managing director of Centaline Mortgage Broker, said that, from a bank's perspective, ""a mortgage for pre-sold developments is a loan without the collateral of a completed property, so the risk is higher.""
Mortgage brokers said only a small number of buyers had been affected as many applications for the two uncompleted projects had previously been approved.
They said prospective buyers could also seek to change payment arrangements with Evergrande to make a purchase after completion.
Eric Tso, senior vice president of Mreferral, said many buyers whose applications were rejected had initially sought to borrow directly from Evergrande, which has in the past offered mortgages of up to 90% of the purchase value. 

""But now Evergrande's not extending mortgages anymore,"" Tso said, adding that banks would typically not offer a mortgage with a loan-to-property value ratio of 90%.
Evergrande did not comment on whether it was still offering mortgages.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds has laid off most of its investment team in Asia outside Japan in a major retreat from the region, three people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
The firm let go of around 25 investment professionals in its mainland China, Hong Kong, India offices on July 8, effective immediately, said two of the people, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The people accounted for nearly 60% of its total workforce in the offices affected, one of the people said.
The retreat mainly resulted from the firm not finding much investment opportunity in Asia outside Japan, the people said.
It comes at a time when private equity dry powder in the region was at a record high $384.9 billion in June, according to data provider Preqin, with global and local firms raising ever bigger funds, and shows some of them are struggling to put the funds to work due to increasing competition and regulatory uncertainty.
Lone Star, which mainly focuses on distressed opportunities, has retained a small number of people in asset management in its Asia offices who manage the firm's current portfolio, they said.
A full retreat would happen after the firm exits all its investments in the region, they said.
A Lone Star spokesperson referred to the firm's announcement on July 8 about global business consolidation and reorganisation in Asia. Under the new structure, Donald Quintin and André Collin, who are in charge of the firm's opportunities funds and commercial real estate funds in Europe and the Americas, respectively, would assume responsibilities for Asia.
Lone Star said in that announcement it had made other changes to streamline Asia operations and realigned its staffing levels in the region, without mentioning details.
The spokesperson declined to comment further.
Lone Star, first established in 1995, set up its Asia offices outside Japan only in recent years with its regional headquarters in Hong Kong, said one of the people. It manages three types of funds - the commercial real estate fund, the opportunity fund and the U.S. residential mortgage fund.
It raised $4.6 billion in the global Lone Star Real Estate Fund VI and $8.1 billion in Lone Star Fund XI in 2019. Most recently it closed a $759 million value-add fund in August 2020, according to the firm's website.
In an internal email dated July 9, which Reuters viewed, Lone Star's President and Chief Legal Officer Bill Young also announced the firm's former Asia President Tony Messina will take a new role as senior managing director, origination, on its commercial real estate platform.
Young did not mention the layoffs or the reason behind the reshuffle in the email.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, continuing to regain momentum on the back of positive U.S. company earnings that eased concerns about the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.97% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT). In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.93% with the state of Queensland closing its border with New South Wales to curb the spread of Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak. The National Australia Bank (NAB) Quarterly Business Confidence index, released earlier in the day, was also a lower-than-expected 17.

Japanese markets were shut for a holiday, ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games’ opening ceremony on Friday.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed towards the 1.3% mark, with a recent bond rally coming to an end and a poor auction of 20-year debt. However, 10-year yields in Australia and New Zealand jumped.
 Verizon Communications  Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and  Coca-Cola Co . (NYSE:KO) reported better-than-estimated results, while United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) forecast profits despite the ever-present threat of COVID-19. The positive results gave U.S. shares a boost, with the S&P 500 recording its biggest back-to-back advance in two months.
Positive earnings, combined with a continuously dovish monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, calmed some of the concerns earlier in the week over surging numbers of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant and its impact on economic recovery.
Some investors remained optimistic about global shares’ prospects, with their turnaround from their selloff early in the week showing “corporations have been very resilient through all this,” Direxion head of product David Mazza told Bloomberg.
“Earnings estimates are quite remarkable, probably some of the best on record. Even through all this, we have central bank liquidity remaining very abundant, economic growth being robust. Certainly there are some question marks around how long that can continue, but for the time being momentum is at investors’ back,” he added.
Other investors sounded a more pessimistic note, however. September and October could be rough for stocks and U.S. equities could pull back 15%, Guggenheim Investments Chairman Scott Minerd told Bloomberg.
On the central bank front, investors now await policy decisions from Bank Indonesia and the European Central Bank (ECB).
In the U.S., Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will likely be renominated for a second term, even as the decision is due later in 2021 and has reportedly not yet been put in front of President Joe Biden. U.S. existing home sales data is also due later in the day.

The grant comes as nations worldwide look at ways to curb their reliance on China for the specialised minerals, which are used in a range of products including electric vehicles, smartphones and military equipment.
Lynas, the world's largest producer of rare earths outside China, said the new refining process would be used at its upcoming A$500 million processing facility in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.
About half the cost of implementing the new process at Kalgoorlie will be met by the grant, which was made as part of the Australian government's Modern Manufacturing Initiative.
According to a government website https://business.gov.au/grants-and-programs/modern-manufacturing-initiative-manufacturing-integration, the initiative supports and co-funds projects to encourage linkages between local businesses and domestic and international firms.
Lynas said it could supply the rare-earth carbonate produced in Kalgoorlie to its plant in Malaysia and its proposed facility in the United States.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 09:11PM ET</span>",U.S. state officials urge support for landmark $26 billion opioid settlement,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) -A group of state attorneys general unveiled on Wednesday a landmark $26 billion settlement with large drug companies for allegedly fueling the deadly nationwide opioid epidemic, but the deal still requires support from thousands of local governments.
Under the settlement proposal, the three largest U.S. drug distributors -- McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp -- are expected to pay a combined $21 billion, while drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) would pay $5 billion. 
The money is expected to be used on addiction treatment, family support, education and other social programs.
""There's not enough money in the world, frankly, to address the pain and suffering,"" said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, but added that the money will ""help where help is needed.""
The deal represents the second-largest cash settlement ever, trailing only the $246 billion tobacco agreement in 1998. Attorneys general from 15 states were involved in negotiating the deal, as were lead lawyers for local governments.
McKesson will pay up to $7.9 billion, while AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal each agreed to provide up to $6.4 billion. The payments will be made over 18 years. 
J&J will pay over nine years, with up to $3.7 billion paid during the first three years. 
Around $2.2 billion of the total would cover attorneys fees and legal costs.
""This settlement will directly support state and local efforts to make meaningful progress in addressing the opioid crisis,"" said Michael Ullmann, Johnson & Johnson's general counsel.
To receive the full payout, the agreement needs support from at least 48 states, 98% of litigating local governments and 97% of the jurisdictions that have yet to sue.
The distributors were accused of lax controls that allowed massive amounts of addictive painkillers to be diverted into illegal channels, devastating communities, while J&J was accused of downplaying the addiction risk in its opioid marketing.
The companies have denied the allegations.
The settlement also calls for the creation of an independent clearinghouse to provide the distributors and state regulators aggregated data about drug shipments, which negotiators hope will help prevent abuse.
In a joint statement, the distributors called the settlement an important step ""toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and delivering meaningful relief to communities across the United States.""
More than 3,000 lawsuits related to the health crisis, mostly by state and local governments, have been filed, and the settlement's ultimate payout depends on the number of localities that agree to drop their lawsuits.
Other settlements are also being negotiated, with the opioid makers Purdue Pharma and  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) Plc working through the bankruptcy courts to secure support for settlements worth more than $10 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
States will have 30 days to evaluate Wednesday's agreement. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said the expectation is ""well north of 40 will sign on.""
The opioid crisis has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of U.S. overdose deaths since 1999, but has hit some regions much harder than others, creating divisions among governments when it comes to considering the settlement.
""States that don't sign on are being irresponsible,"" said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry. ""We don't want perfect to be the enemy of the good.""
Shares of the distributors each rose about 1.5%, while J&J, which also reported quarterly results on Wednesday, rose about 0.6%. Shares in the companies had climbed on Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement.
""NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH""
Washington state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, said he would not join the deal. ""The settlement is, to be blunt, not nearly good enough for Washington,"" he said.
To receive the full payout, the agreement needs support from at least 48 states, 98% of litigating local governments and 97% of the jurisdictions that have yet to sue.
Electing to participate only guarantees a state some of the money. The settlement provides a base payout of up to $12.12 billion if all states agreed to the deal, and another $10.7 billion tied to localities joining the deal.
""Everyone has a common interest to get maximum participation to get a maximum amount of funds for abatement nationally,"" said Joe Rice, a lead lawyer for the local governments.
Once a state agrees to the deal, its local governments have up to 120 days to join. They can only join if a state does. Paul Geller, a lead negotiator for the plaintiffs, said if a state was unsure about joining, ""the subdivisions ought to let the state know they want the money.""
About half of the states, in anticipation of the settlement, have passed legislation or signed agreements with their localities governing how settlement money will be distributed, according to Christine Minhee, who runs an opioid litigation watchdog project supported by an Open Society Foundations Soros Justice Fellowship.
Legislation does not guarantee success. In Indiana, cities and counties representing more than half of the state's population have opted out after a law limited their cut to 15%.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita's office said if those local governments do not opt back into the deal, the state could lose up to $237.9 million of the $507 million it would receive.

Communities in hard-hit West Virginia opted out of the deal after being offered less than 1% of the money, said Paul Farrell, a lawyer for West Virginia plaintiffs. Local governments in the state are pursuing a case that is on trial against distributors.
The settlement comes even as the crisis has shown no sign of letting up. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week said provisional data showed that 2020 was a record year for overall drug overdose deaths, at 93,331, up 29% from a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Business software maker Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) on Wednesday closed its $27.7 billion purchase of Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc, a massive bet that Slack's workplace app will become popular for collaborations within and between companies.
U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal this week, allowing the creation of a stronger challenger to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), the top workplace software provider whose Teams app competes with Slack for market dominance.
The merger partners hope the deal will bolster efforts to connect their joint customers to smooth out common business deals, Salesforce President Bret Taylor and Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said in an interview on Wednesday.
They also want to reduce the complexity of using hundreds of different cloud-based apps that have crept into workplaces, they added. 
For example, a Slack ""channel"" can be created to replace all the emails, phone calls and video conferences that might otherwise occur between a sales team doing a deal with a procurement team at another company. Thousands of apps work with Slack, so documents from third-party platforms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive can be signed in the channel with services like DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Inc, Taylor said.
""We did the due diligence for the Slack acquisition in Slack,"" Taylor noted.
""I joked it had the highest billable hours of any channel ever, because we had all the lawyers in there and the investment banks,"" he said, but ""it was really a transformative experience.""

While analysts view Teams as Slack's largest rival, Butterfield said Slack will continue to integrate with the Microsoft app in line with its goal to make it easier for employees to get things done.
""What customers want is interoperability. They don't want to have to make hard choices,"" Butterfield said. ""We'll integrate with everyone - Microsoft and Salesforce, of course, but also ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and more or less anyone you can think of.""

(Reuters) -Texas Instruments Inc forecast current-quarter revenue slightly below Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, leaving investors concerned about the chipmaker's ability to meet searing demand in the face of a global shortage.
Shares of the Dallas, Texas-based company were down nearly 5% at $185.5 aftermarket. 
TI has been ramping up its production capacity even as supply constraints persist, eyeing a boom in demand from many of its end markets. In June, TI said it would buy one of Micron (NASDAQ:MU)'s factories for $900 million, making it the company's fourth analog chip-manufacturing plant.
""The common perception in the market is that demand still remains very strong, and many investors expect above-average revenue growth for the next couple of quarters,"" said Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk.
""This guidance clearly flies in the face of that belief."" 
The company expects third-quarter revenue between $4.40 billion and $4.76 billion, with the midpoint below analysts' expectations of $4.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, the company beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter results, helped by a more than 40% rise in revenue from both its analog chips and embedded processing businesses.

""Normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things in periods like this,"" TI's finance chief, Rafael Lizardi, told analysts, noting that the second quarter was strong both sequentially and year-on-year. 
For the second quarter, it earned $2.05 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.83. Total revenue rose 41% to $4.58 billion, above expectations of $4.35 billion.

(Reuters) -California power company Pacific Gas and Electric said on Wednesday it would bury 10,000 miles of power lines in high-risk fire zones as a safety measure after its equipment caused multiple destructive wildfires over several years.
The utility, which called the project a multi-year initiative, maintains more than 25,000 miles of overhead distribution power lines in the highest fire-risk zones, or more than 30% of its total distribution overhead system, according to the company.
The move by PG&E (NYSE:PCG) comes days after it said its equipment may have been involved in the start of a recent wildfire in Sierra Nevada, according to a filing by PG&E to regulators published on the internet by a San Francisco Chronicle journalist. (https:// The company emerged from bankruptcy last year. It had sought protection from creditors after wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 drove the utility's potential liabilities into tens of billions of dollars. ""Following the devastating October 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, PG&E began to evaluate placing overhead power lines underground as a wildfire safety measure,"" the company said on Wednesday. As part of PG&E's exit from bankruptcy, California officials established a six-step oversight process to hold the utility accountable if it was deemed to be falling short on safety measures. In April, however, the officials voted to toughen oversight of PG&E, saying the utility had largely failed to perform required tree-trimming work near power lines in areas with the highest risk of wildfires. PG&E, which announced the new safety initiative in Butte County, serves more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California. Burying power lines, or undergrounding, lessens the need for public safety power shutoffs, which are a last resort during dry, windy conditions to reduce the risk of trees touching live power lines and sparking a wildfire. 
In 2020, California suffered its most damaging wildfire season on record in terms of acreage burned. As of May, California authorities documented over 1,000 more wildfires across the state this year than had erupted by the same time last year. U.S. President Joe Biden said last month the country was behind in preparing for what could be a record number of forest fires this year because of drought and high temperatures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and Germany on Wednesday unveiled an agreement on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under which Berlin pledged to respond to any attempt by Russia to use energy as a weapon against Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European countries.
The pact aims to mitigate what critics see as the strategic dangers of the $11 billion pipeline, now 98% complete, being built under the Baltic Sea to carry gas from Russia's Arctic region to Germany.
U.S. officials have opposed the pipeline, which would allowRussia to export gas directly to Germany and potentially cut offother nations, but President Joe Biden's administration has chosen not to try to kill it with U.S. sanctions.
Instead, it has negotiated the pact with Germany that threatens to impose costs on Russia if it seeks to use the pipeline to harm Ukraine or other countries in the region.
But those measures appeared to have done little to calm fears in Ukraine, which said it was asking for talks with both the European Union and Germany over the pipeline. The agreement also faces political opposition in the United States and Germany.
A joint statement setting out the details of the deal said Washington and Berlin were ""united in their determination to hold Russia to account for its aggression and malign activities by imposing costs via sanctions and other tools."" 
If Russia attempts to ""use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine,"" Germany will take steps on its own and push for actions at the EU, including sanctions, ""to limit Russian export capabilities to Europe in the energy sector,"" the statement said.
It did not detail specific Russian actions that would trigger such a move. ""We elected not to provide Russia with a road map in terms of how they can evade that commitment to push back,"" a senior State Department official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""We also will certainly look to hold any future German governments accountable for the commitments that they have made in this,"" the official said.
Under the agreement, Germany will ""utilize all available leverage"" to extend by 10 years the Russia-Ukraine gas transit agreement, a source of major revenues to Ukraine that expires in 2024.
Germany will also contribute at least $175 million to a new $1 billion ""Green Fund for Ukraine"" aimed at improving the country's energy independence.
'THREATENS UKRAINE'S SECURITY'
Ukraine sent notes to Brussels and Berlin calling for consultations, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet, adding the pipeline ""threatens Ukraine's security.""
Kuleba also issued a statement with Poland's foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, pledging to work together to oppose Nord Stream 2.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was looking forward to a ""frank and vibrant"" discussion with Biden over the pipeline when the two meet in Washington next month. The visit was announced by the White House on Wednesday, but press secretary Jen Psaki said the timing of the announcement was not related to the pipeline agreement. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin hours before the release of the agreement, the German government said, saying Nord Stream 2 and gas transit via Ukraine were among the topics.
The pipeline had been hanging over U.S.-German relations since former President Donald Trump said it could turn Germany into a ""hostage of Russia"" and approved some sanctions.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter he was ""relieved that we have found a constructive solution.""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, asked about the reported details of the agreement earlier on Wednesday, said any threat of sanctions against Russia was not ""acceptable,"" according to the Interfax news agency.
LAWMAKER OPPOSITION
Even before it was made public, leaked details of the agreement were drawing criticism from ome lawmakers in both Germany and the United States. 
Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who has been holding up Biden's ambassadorial nominations over his concerns about Nord Stream 2, said the reported agreement would be ""a generational geopolitical win for Putin and a catastrophe for the United States and our allies.""
Cruz and some other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are furious with the Democratic president for waiving congressionally mandated sanctions against the pipeline and are working on ways to force the administration's hand on sanctions, according to congressional aides.
Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she was not convinced the agreement would mitigate the impact of the pipeline, which she said ""empowers the Kremlin to spread its malign influence throughout Eastern Europe.""
""I’m skeptical that it will be sufficient when the key player at the table – Russia – refuses to play by the rules,"" Shaheen said.
In Germany, top members of the environmentalist Greens party called the reported agreement ""a bitter setback for climate protection"" that would benefit Putin and weaken Ukraine.

Biden administration officials insist the pipeline was so close to being finished when they took office in January that there was no way for them to prevent its completion.
""Certainly we think that there is more that the previous administration could have done,"" the U.S. official said. ""But, you know, we were making the best of a bad hand.""

234,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>",AT&T to sell its LatAm DirecTV business to Grupo Werthein,"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said on Wednesday it would sell Vrio Corp, its DirecTV business unit in Latin America, to Argentina-based investment group Grupo Werthein after taking a $4.6 billion impairment charge.
The telecom operator said it took the impairment charge in the second quarter of 2021 as it had classified Vrio as ""held-for-sale"".
The company did not reveal the deal value at which it will sell Vrio to Grupo Werthein. AT&T is scheduled to report its second quarter results on Thursday. 
The deal comes amid tough competition for cable television service providers as the industry battles with customers cancelling accounts and moving to video streaming services such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.
Moreover, AT&T has been seeking to unwind its debt-laden acquisitions and lighten its balance sheet. 

AT&T and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) had said in May that they would combine content from WarnerMedia - including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, news network CNN and sports programming - and Discovery's unscripted shows from lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC. The enterprise value of the combined company will be $120 billion.
The Vrio Corp deal is expected to close in early 2022. AT&T's 41.3% interest in Sky Mexico is not part of the deal, the company said on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury Department is projected to exhaust its borrowing authority in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday, as a partisan fight over raising the nation's debt ceiling erupted in Congress.
""If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both,"" the non-partisan CBO said in a statement.
A failure to work out differences over whether government spending cuts should accompany an increase in the statutory debt limit, currently set at $28.5 trillion, could lead to a federal government shutdown - as has happened three times in the past decade - or even a debt default.
The White House urged Congress to resolve partisan differences, even as Republicans seized upon the debt limit issue to attack Democrats for pushing legislation that they say has led to inflation and escalating public debt.
""We expect Congress to act in a timely manner to raise or suspend the debt ceiling as they did three times on a broad bipartisan basis during the last administration,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control both the Senate and House of Representatives. No senior Republicans have threatened a shutdown in recent public statements. Democrats are insisting on a ""clean"" debt limit increase unfettered by a fight over spending reductions.
The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday that members of his party would be unlikely to support a debt limit increase given the current Democratic drive for a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure investment bill.
""I can't imagine there will be a single Republican voting to raise the debt ceiling after what we've been experiencing,"" McConnell told the Congress-focused Punchbowl News. 
But Republican Senator Mike Rounds, for one, noted he has voted for debt ceiling increases in the past and said, ""My personal opinion is that once we have acquired the debt, we are responsible for the debt and you need to address the debt.""
McConnell suggested Democrats handle a debt limit increase in a second spending measure they are expecting to pass without Republican votes in a maneuver called reconciliation.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called McConnell's remarks ""shameless, cynical and totally political."" Schumer said Republicans did not raise such concerns during the presidency of Republican Donald Trump and that some of the debt is related to emergency aid for the COVID-19 pandemic.
SIGNS OF WALL STREET WORRY
The Treasury Department on July 31 technically bumps up against its statutory debt limit. Much like a personal credit card maximum, the debt ceiling is the amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow to meet its obligations. These range from paying military salaries and IRS tax refunds to Social Security benefits and even interest payments on the debt.
Since the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it keeps operating by borrowing more and more.
For many years, the statutory debt limit was raised to a specific dollar level. More recently, Congress has set the limit to a specific date in the future.
Lawmakers often try to extend borrowing authority to beyond the next U.S. election so that it does not become a campaign issue. The midterm elections that will determine whether Democrats retain control of Congress are set for November 2022.
If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling from its current $28.5 trillion by the time that the Treasury Department's borrowing authority runs out, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to take special steps to avoid a government default. Such stop-gap measures are effective for only a short period.

Failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a repeat of the government shutdowns that occurred in 2013, January 2018 and 35 days from late December 2018 into January 2019. Other factors also were in play during those disruptions.
In a sign of Wall Street's worry about the approaching limits, yields on short-term U.S. Treasury debt have inched up to around 0.05%, after having hovered near zero since early in the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday selected friends and campaign donors for a set of ambassador slots, including nominating a Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) adviser as the top U.S. diplomat in Canada.
Biden picked David Cohen, a senior adviser to Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts and a key lobbyist for the media giant, to represent the United States in Ottawa.
The two allies and key trading partners have occasionally been at odds since Biden took office in January, including over when to reopen normal travel across their shared border amid the COVID-19 pandemic and his decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline, which was planned to carry Canadian oil to U.S. markets.
Biden also chose Victoria Kennedy, a longtime friend, gun control activist and the widow of late Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, for the top U.S. ambassadorial post in Austria.

Cohen and Kennedy were top fundraisers for the Democratic president's campaign against Republican former President Donald Trump. Biden also chose Jamie Harpootlian, the wife of another major campaign contributor and supporter, as his ambassador to Slovenia.
U.S. ambassador nominations, which require Senate confirmation, are highly sought after by political allies and campaign donors.

(Reuters) - A Massachusetts couple sued eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) on Wednesday for being subjected to an ""unrelenting stream"" of threats by its employees to stifle their online newsletter critical of the e-commerce company.
In a complaint filed in Boston federal court, David and Ina Steiner accused eBay of conspiring through its employees and contractors to ""intimidate, threaten to kill, torture, terrorize, stalk and silence them"" for their reporting in the newsletter, EcommerceBytes.
Federal prosecutors have said the Steiners were subjected in the summer of 2019 to anonymous email and Twitter threats; covert surveillance; deliveries to their home including live cockroaches, a bloody Halloween pig mask and a funeral wreath; and pornography sent in their names to neighbors.
At least seven people have been criminally charged, and five have pleaded guilty, according to court records.
In response to a request for comment about the lawsuit, eBay said: ""The misconduct of these former employees was wrong, and we will do what is fair and appropriate to try to address what the Steiners went through. We are very sorry for what they endured.""
EBay has said it has cooperated with prosecutors.
The cyberstalking campaign began shortly after the Natick, Massachusetts couple published an article concerning a lawsuit filed by eBay, prosecutors said.
In their 93-page complaint, the Steiners said the harassment caused them emotional distress, including a perpetual fear of being followed, and hurt their newsletter because sources and customers worry they could become eBay's next victims.

They are seeking unspecified damages from San Jose, California-based eBay and several former employees, including two former security executives, for the harassment.
The case is Steiner et al v eBay Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 21-11181.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 04:12PM ET</span>","FTC votes to make 'right to repair' a priority, drops 1995 merger policy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S Federal Trade Commission voted Wednesday to make it a priority to address the issue of manufacturers pushing consumers to use licensed dealers to repair items ranging from smartphones to farm equipment, a practice that critics call anti-competitive.
The five commissioners, three Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously to approve the policy statement.
""The FTC has a range of tools it can use to root out unlawful repair restrictions and today's policy statement would commit us to move forward on this issue with new vigor,"" FTC Chair Lina Khan said at an unusual open hearing, the second held by the agency this month.
Commissioner Noah Phillips, a Republican, supported the step. ""While there are repair restrictions that are legitimate, whether it's smartphones or tractors, I absolutely agree that there are many unwarranted restrictions that make it (repairs) excessively difficult and expensive,"" he said.
The vote followed an agency report released in May that found that manufacturers often discourage repairs by third parties that can charge consumers less than dealers. These include disparaging spare parts not made by the manufacturer, and license agreements.
The issue was one of dozens spelled out in an executive order that the Biden White House put out this month.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce vehemently objected to the way the meeting was conducted. Sean Heather, a chamber vice president, said the agency's new open meetings ""have embraced a vote now, discuss policy later approach that ignores public input, making the entire process anything but transparent and above board.""
The FTC's commissioners voted along party lines to rescind a 1995 policy statement regarding prior approval of mergers. With the statement rescinded, a company that had been stopped from proceeding with one merger must give prior notice to the FTC if it is contemplating a similar transaction. The FTC could then stop the new deal without spending months to investigate the new deal.
Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, said there was no evidence to support scrapping the 1995 policy statement.

Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, said FTC staff spent a lot of time and resources looking at ""clearly anti-competitive"" mergers. ""I think a lot about the deterrent effect that we need to be sending,"" she said.
The FTC also voted unanimously to keep a rule requiring clothing manufacturers to spell out how their clothing should be cared for but indicated that it would update it.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 03:46PM ET</span>",1.5 million children have lost parents to pandemic; potential brain gateway for virus found,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.
1.5 million children lost parents to COVID-19 so far
During the first 14 months of the pandemic, an estimated 1.5 million children worldwide experienced the death of a parent, custodial grandparent, or other relative who cared for them, as a result of COVID-19, according to a study published in The Lancet https:// on Tuesday. The orphanhood estimates are drawn from mortality data from 21 countries that account for 77% of global COVID-19 deaths and from the United Nations Population Division. ""For every two COVID-19 deaths worldwide, one child is left behind to face the death of a parent or caregiver,"" Dr. Susan Hillis from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Team, who led the study, said in a statement. The number of COVID-19 orphans will increase as the pandemic progresses, she added. There is an urgent need to prioritize these children and ""support them for many years into the future,"" Hillis said. Said study coauthor Lucie Cluver of Oxford University: ""And we need to respond fast because every 12 seconds a child loses their caregiver to COVID-19."" 
Potential brain gateway found for coronavirus
Researchers have found a potential route of entry for the coronavirus into the human brain that may help explain the effects of COVID-19 on the brain and nervous system that have plagued many patients. To date there is no evidence that the virus directly infects neurons - the brain cells that receive and send messages to and from the body. In a new study, experimenting with an artificially grown mass of cells created to resemble the brain, researchers found that neurons seemed ""impervious"" to the coronavirus, said Joseph Gleeson of the University of California, San Diego. But cells called pericytes, which wrap around blood vessels and carry the surface protein the virus uses for entry, proved to be a different story. When researchers added pericytes to their artificial brain and then added the virus, ""we found incredibly robust infection,"" not just of the pericytes but also of the neurons, Gleeson said. They report in Nature Medicine https://go.nature.com/3eHmumt that the pericytes served as ""factories"" for the virus, from which it could multiply. The primary targets were astrocytes, which have crucial roles in regulating the brain's electrical impulses, providing neurons with nutrients, and maintaining the ""blood-brain barrier"" that shields the brain from foreign substances. The findings, Gleeson said, suggest ""pericytes could serve as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2,"" which could either lead to local increases in the virus or to inflammation of blood vessels that can cause stroke. 
Vaccine boosters not yet needed, researchers say

Two doses of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) are effective at neutralizing the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus that is or will soon be dominant in most places, suggesting immediate booster doses are not likely needed, researchers said. They did not measure the vaccines' ability to protect against infection in the real world. In their lab experiments using blood samples from vaccinated volunteers, however, Delta's mutations caused only low reductions in the proportion of antibodies that could neutralize the virus, they said. Mutations in the less prevalent Beta and Gamma variants reduced antibody neutralization capacity more significantly, but not to a point where vaccine recipients would appear to be unprotected, the researchers reported on Sunday in a paper posted on medRxiv https:// ahead of peer review. Vaccine boosters may be needed in the future to help overcome some variants, coauthor Akiko Iwasaki of Yale University said in a tweet on Tuesday. Her team also found that overall, neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination were higher in COVID-19 survivors than in uninfected vaccine recipients. ""This is not surprising,"" Iwasaki told Reuters, ""because infection itself induces immune responses, which were boosted by the two doses of vaccines.""

“Aramco recently became aware of the indirect release of a limited amount of company data which was held by third-party contractors,” the Middle Eastern oil major said Wednesday in an email. “We confirm that the release of data was not due to a breach of our systems, has no impact on our operations, and the company continues to maintain a robust cybersecurity posture.”
The Associated Press reported earlier that 1 terabyte of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. data had been held by an extortionist, citing a web page it had accessed on the darknet. The state-owned driller was offered the chance to have the data deleted for $50 million in cryptocurrency, the AP said.
The global energy industry has seen a ramp up in cyber attacks with Colonial Pipeline becoming the most visible of late. The oil and gas industry, which includes the companies that own wells, pipelines and refineries, has long been a laggard in security spending, according to consultants.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Markets continued their upward march on Wednesday and yields climbed due partly to positive corporate earnings, despite apprehension about the Delta coronavirus variant and inflation, which spurred a flight to safety earlier in the week.
Wall Street extended gains after ending Tuesday sharply higher when it snapped a several-day losing streak. Yields on U.S. treasuries rose as markets regained a sense of calm.
Positive earnings from major companies, including  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co United Airlines and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), helped fuel the gains. 
“There’s a lot of nice follow-through from yesterday. On Monday there was a growth scare, and on Tuesday we recovered from that. Investors realized it was an over-reaction,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. 
“Today is a continuation from yesterday showing that although global growth may be impacted in the short run, we ultimately are still on a recovery path, and it makes sense to stay long the market.""
By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 259.9 points, or 0.75%, to 34,771.89, the S&P 500 gained 29.45 points, or 0.68%, to 4,352.51 and the Nasdaq Composite added 93.29 points, or 0.64%, to 14,592.17.
The yield on benchmark U.S. Treasuries rebounded for a second day on Wednesday, with 10-year Treasury notes up 7.9 basis points to 1.288%, after briefly crossing above 1.3%. Demand at an sale of 20-year government debt was tepid as investors preferred riskier assets.
""I think the big issue out there that we see from investors is where else can I go to make money except the stock market,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. 
""With a very accommodating Fed, saying they’re not going to raise rates out until 2022 or longer, the market should continue to do well,"" Bradshaw said.
Stocks could receive a further uplift later Wednesday if U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill can navigate a planned procedural vote despite Republican appeals for delay. A vote was scheduled for mid afternoon.
A European Central Bank meeting on Thursday is expected to strike a dovish tone and provide a further boost. 
The safe-haven dollar on Wednesday retreated from more than three-month highs, but inflation fears and concerns about the highly contagious coronavirus variant kept investors cautious.
Another safe haven, the Japanese yen, was also down against the dollar, as risk aversion eased.
The dollar index, a measure of its value against six major currencies was little changed to slightly lower at 92.911. On Tuesday, the index hit a more than three-month high.
As well as looking past rising COVID-19 cases, investors appeared to look past concerns that data last week showing a surge in U.S. consumer prices in June could prompt the Federal Reserve to bring a quicker end to emergency stimulus measures.
That earlier flight to safe-havens had pushed the U.S. 10-year yield down < US10YT=RR> more than 20 basis points in the space of a week.
Gold, likewise, lost some of its recent safe-haven appeal on Wednesday, with spot gold dropping 0.4% to $1,802.79 an ounce.
RISING INFECTIONS
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.85%.
""While some of the world is shrugging off rising infections as vaccination rates limit the severity of any symptoms of new cases, there are few parts of the world that can totally ignore this,"" said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific chief economist at ING.

Oil prices rose as improved risk appetite provided support despite data showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories last week and a weaker demand outlook due to rising COVID-19 infections.
U.S. crude rose 4.75% to $70.39 per barrel and Brent was at $72.32, up 4.28% on the day.

(Reuters) -Shares of Paycor HCM Inc jumped 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, giving a valuation of $4.8 billion for the human capital management firm that primarily caters to small and medium-sized businesses.
The stock opened at $28 per share, above the IPO price of $23. On a fully diluted basis, the company is valued at $4.87 billion at the opening price.
Paycor on Tuesday raised $425.5 million through the sale of 18.5 million shares in an initial public offering, where the stock was priced above an earlier targeted range of $18 to $21.
Founded in 1990, Paycor offers solutions for managing human resources, payroll, talent and workforce, targeting businesses with a headcount between 10 and 1,000. It had over 44,000 clients as of March 31 this year.
The majority of small and medium-sized businesses in the United States are underserved by legacy payroll providers, giving Paycor a unique opportunity in a big market, Chief Executive Officer Raul Villar Jr told Reuters.
The United States is seeing an uptick in job growth, as companies hired the most number of workers in 10 months in June, following a reopening made possible by COVID-19 vaccinations.
Paycor's revenue rose 4% year-on-year to $264.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, a regulatory filing showed. However, it incurred a net loss of $46.2 million in the same period.

UK private equity firm Apax Partners, which acquired Cincinnati, Ohio-based Paycor in 2018, will hold the majority of its outstanding common stock.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for the offering.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on home improvement stocks Lowe's (LOW), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), Mohawk (MHK), and Snap-on (NYSE:SNA). They are currently trading at prices below their recent highs. Let’s discuss.The remote working culture ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon for the home improvement industry because people have prioritized upgrading their homes or shifting to bigger living spaces in suburban areas. While the economy’s reopening has reduced the demand for home improvement products to an extent, as people focus on outdoor activities, organizations' continued adoption of hybrid working structures should drive their employees’ continued spending on home improvement.
The red-hot housing market and the trend in buying old homes should keep driving the demand for home improvement products and services. According to a recently published Allied Market Research report, the global home improvement services market is expected to grow at a 6.2% CAGR from 2021 - 2030.
Increasing disposable income with the falling unemployment rate should further support the growth of the home improvement industry.

(Reuters) -Coca-Cola Co will rely on its pandemic-tested strategy of focusing on bigger brands and doubling down on its supply chain to combat a potential impact from the Delta variant of the coronavirus, its finance chief said on Wednesday. 
CFO John Murphy's comments come as the re-opening of global economies helped the beverage giant beat second-quarter expectations and raise its full-year sales forecast, sending the Dow component's shares up as much as 3%.
Surging infections from Australia to the United States have brought back lockdowns and other restrictions in some regions, raising fears over the pace of the economic recovery and rattling stock markets earlier this week.
Sales in some markets in Asia were hit in the second quarter from the resurgence, Murphy said, adding some likely impact of the variant was baked into the raised sales forecast.
""When things get more constrained, the bigger brands are the ones you focus on,"" Murphy told Reuters.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has streamlined its product range over the past year to ease the fallout from the pandemic. The company, which owns brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Dasani, has discontinued its TaB diet soda and Coca-Cola Energy brands in the United States, and sold its ZICO coconut water brand.
The company is particularly vulnerable to the closing of theaters, restaurants and stadiums, unlike rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) that relies more on grocery and retail channels.
""If we have a re-closing of venues or capacity restrictions re-implemented, Coke sales are going to suffer. For that reason we view it as the riskier name to Pepsi,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. 
Coca-Cola's adjusted overall revenue rose 41.1% in the second quarter to $10.13 billion, beating estimates of $9.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitv. 

The company raised its annual organic revenue target to an increase of 12% to 14%, from the high single digits rise expected earlier. Annual adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 13% to 15%.
Adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share beat expectations of 56 cents.

(Reuters) -Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc beat estimates for earnings and comparable quarterly sales on Tuesday but warned that higher beef and freight costs will offset the benefit of menu prices hikes in the near term.
Restaurants have been plagued by outages of everything from green tea to paper bags, as well as labor shortages, as the U.S. economy has reopened following pandemic-related lockdowns.
In the current quarter, commodity costs and staffing shortages at suppliers will mostly cancel out the 3.5% to 4% menu price increase originally implemented to pay for higher wages, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said in a call with analysts.
""It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issues,"" Hartung said.
Sales at the burrito and bowl chain, which had already recovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, grew even stronger as restrictions eased and Americans trickled back to offices and ordered more lunch. 
Excluding one-time items, the company posted earnings per share of $7.46 for the second quarter ended June 30, crushing estimates of $6.52 and sending shares up more than 4% in extended trading.
Comparable sales rose 31.2%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 29.4% growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) said it expects third-quarter sales growth in the low to mid double-digits range, compared with estimates of 9.7%.
Net income was about $188 million, or $6.60 per share, for the quarter, compared with $8.2 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.
Restaurant operating margin was 24.5% - an increase from 12.2% in the second quarter of 2020 and the highest level since the third quarter of 2015.
Higher margins came despite raising employee pay to an average $15 an hour by late June - thanks to menu price hikes.

So far the company has seen ""no resistance"" to higher menu prices, Hartung said.
The chain also opened 56 new locations during the quarter, including 45 with order-ahead drive-through ""Chipotlanes,"" putting it on track to meet or slightly exceed its previous expectation of building about 200 new restaurants this year.

(Reuters) -Lithia Motors Inc reported record quarterly results on Wednesday, helped by robust demand for personal vehicles, but the U.S. auto retailer warned that profit margin will likely reduce by early 2022 as the supply of vehicles normalizes.
Preference for personal vehicles and low interest rates during the pandemic increased the demand for new and used cars, dwindling supplies at auto retailers and pushing up prices.
""We are not assuming that the current margin levels will continue,"" Chief Executive Officer Bryan DeBoer said on a post-earnings call.
The Medford, Oregon-based company said it expects automobile inventory, crippled by the global semiconductor shortage, to start normalizing in the second half of 2021.
Guggenheim Securities analyst Ali Faghri said he doesn't expect dealer inventory to normalize until late 2022 or 2023.
""Pricing (and dealer margins) have likely peaked, but will likely remain at elevated levels through next year as vehicle supply remains constrained,"" Faghri added.
Lithia's average gross profit for new vehicles and used vehicles surged 58% and 47%, respectively, during the second quarter ended June 30.
Earlier this week, top U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) also posted record earnings and forecast strong demand for new vehicles to continue into 2022.
Lithia said there were 23 days of supply for new vehicles during the quarter, compared with 61 days a year earlier.
The company's quarterly profit jumped to $304.9 million. On an adjusted basis, Lithia earned $11.12 per share, beating estimates of $6.17, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Revenue more than doubled to $6.01 billion.
The company's shares were up 5.6% at $375.40.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking to a mounting pile of cash at U.S. companies to provide support for the stock market in coming months, as executives announce plans to increase share buybacks, boost dividends or pour money back into their businesses. 
Cash on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies has swelled to a record $1.9 trillion, compared to $1.5 trillion before the pandemic crisis in early 2020, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.
The cash hoard likely will be a key factor in investors’ calculus as second-quarter earnings season hits full swing while market participants gauge how equities respond to worries over slowing growth and a COVID-19 resurgence that sparked a rush to safe-haven Treasuries in recent days.
High corporate cash balances are “a nice, subtle form of market support,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive officer at Tallbacken Capital Advisors. “With all the talk about markets getting ahead of themselves and aggressive valuations, this provides market support into 2022 and 2023.”
Large amounts of cash give companies flexibility to take potentially share-supportive measures, including facilitating buybacks, which boost earnings per share. Companies may also raise dividends, making their stocks more attractive to income-seeking investors amid falling Treasury yields.
A stock basket created by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) of companies returning a comparatively large amount of cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends had outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 by 5% as of last Thursday. A separate basket of companies with relatively high capital spending or research and development expenses outperformed by 2%.
""Investors have rewarded all uses of cash recently,"" Goldman said in a report last week. The investment bank's strategists projected buybacks will increase by 35% this year.
The focus on cash comes as investors try to read conflicting market signals that have emerged over the last few weeks.
Though stocks stand near records, Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to their lowest level since February this week amid concerns the Delta variant of COVID-19 could hamper the economic recovery.
Expectations of big corporate spending could encourage investors to buy future stock dips, softening declines that some say are overdue. The S&P 500 has averaged three pullbacks of at least 5% a year since 1950, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), but has yet to log such a drop in 2021. 
RISING BUYBACKS
U.S. companies have announced $350 billion in buybacks in the second quarter, the largest since the second quarter of 2018, after announcing $275 billion in the first quarter, according to EPFR.
Total S&P 500 dividend payouts rose 3.6% to $123.4 billion in the second quarter from the year-ago period, although that amount trailed record payouts in the first quarter of 2020, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Investors will get further insight into spending plans as more results arrive, including reports from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) due next week. Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) and AutoNation (NYSE:AN) were among companies that this week expanded buyback programs. 
Technology and financials announced the largest amount of buybacks among sectors so far this year, JP Morgan said in a note this week. Apple alone in April raised its share repurchase authorization by $90 billion.

Dealmaking is another way companies could deploy their resources, with Goldman projecting S&P 500 cash spending on mergers and acquisitions will jump by 45% to $324 billion this year. 
“A lot of these mega-cap companies are generating so much cash that they can make sizable acquisitions,"" said Charlie Ryan, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. “There is a competitive advantage to having that scale, having that cash on the balance sheet.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) -The head of United Airlines expects a recovery in travel demand to continue despite a resurgence in COVID-19 spurred by the more contagious Delta variant but warned on Wednesday of vagaries until more people are vaccinated against the virus.
""There's going to be ups and downs between now and the time that enough of the world is vaccinated that this (pandemic) really proceeds into the background, which we look forward to,"" United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on an investor call.
Chicago-based United reported late Tuesday forecast-beating revenue for the three months to June on a strong domestic travel rebound and said it expects to return to profitability in the third quarter. 
""We think the most likely outcome is that the continued recovery in demand continues largely unabated...because the evidence is overwhelming that someone who's vaccinated is highly protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" Kirby said.
Only around half of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, fuelling a fresh vaccination push by U.S. President Joe Biden.
Still, Kirby said both business and leisure demand had recovered faster than expected, with bookings ""getting stronger and stronger every week.""
Shares in United rose 3.5% in midday trading, in line with U.S. airline index gains.
It expects business demand to improve by the end of the third quarter to be down about 40% to 45% versus the same period in 2019 before the pandemic as more businesses reopen.
A recovery in international travel, to which United is more exposed than rivals, hinges on the easing of border controls.

The United States, for example, continues to bar entry to most non-U.S. citizens who have been in Britain, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the past 14 days.
United said it does not expect to restore its schedule to Europe before spring, 2022, and to Asia until at least 2023.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",Global venture capital investments hit record high,"By Gaurav Dogra and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - Global venture capital investments are at record levels this year, boosted by a surge in equities, higher liquidity and an increased interest in sectors that have benefited from the coronavirus pandemic.
According to Refinitiv data, global venture capital funds invested $268.7 billion so far in 2021, far outstripping their total investments of $251.2 billion a year earlier. 
The bulk of those deals were in software, e-commerce, digital healthcare and fin-tech companies, whose products and services have seen strong demand during the pandemic, data showed.

Graphic: Global venture capital deals by month: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbknnmlpq/Global%20venture%20capital%20deals%20by%20month.jpg 
""(Lockdowns) and changes in consumer behaviour have fuelled growth for digital startups, in turn, accelerating investor appetite,"" said Jaime Moreno, chief operating officer of Secfi, a San Francisco-based provider of equity planning tools for startup employees.
Late-stage startups have attracted the lion's share of the funds, with venture capital firms pumping in $195.3 billion, or about 73% of their total investments, while early-stage companies have received $73.4 billion.
""Venture capital continues to flow into later-stage startups. This is driven by the euphoria of several large later stage exits recently,"" said Swati Chaturvedi, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based angel investing platform Propel X. 
""Additionally, venture capital firms are sitting on lots of dry powder.""
Rock-bottom interest rates, a rush to diversify their portfolios and a string of successful exits have also prompted global investors to set aside more money for venture capital funds this year.
U.S. venture capital funds raised $70 billion in the first half of the year, a 65% increase from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. Asian and European funds raised $16.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, much higher than in 2020.
""This record breaking year for venture capital funding globally is the result of the creative economy being a legitimate asset class and investors knowing they need to have an allocation,"" said Jeff Ransdell, managing director of Miami, Florida-based Fuel Venture Capital said.
""Companies are simply staying private longer than ever before, so the wealth creation is largely in the private sector at the moment.""
Last month, venture capital firm Accel raised more than $3 billion across three new investment funds to back companies in the United States, Europe and Israel.
Since 2019, 10 companies, in which Accel had invested, were taken public, including Slack, Bumble, UiPath, CrowdStrike and Deliveroo. 
Life sciences venture capital firm Vida Ventures raised $825 million last month in an oversubscribed funding round for its third fund from existing and new blue-chip institutional investors across the globe.

Data from CB Insights showed Tiger Global and Andreessen Horowitz were leading the deal activity in the second quarter.

Investing.com – Qualtrics (NASDAQ:XM) stock rose 3% Wednesday as the company revised its annual guidance for the second time while reporting second quarter numbers that beat estimates.
The company expects 2021 total revenue to come between $1.007 billion and $1.011 billion. Diluted adjusted earnings per share is seen flat to a 2 cent loss per share.
The company had in April guided diluted adjusted loss per share of 13 cents to 11 cents on $980 million to $984 million revenue.
It had revised its guidance in April after giving it first in March.
Qualtrics makes software that helps companies engage better with their consumers and employees.  
The company’s total revenue for the second quarter was $249.3 million, up from $181 million in the quarter year ago.
While revenue rose 38%, operating expenses soared 79%, mainly on account of general and administrative costs that more than trebled. Research and development expenses rose too while sales and marketing costs increased negligibly.  
As a result, net loss more than doubled to $263.5 million from $127.5 million.

Overall economic losses came in below their 10-year average, however, at $93 billion, Aon said in a report.
Disasters which hit developed countries typically lead to greater insured losses. Seventy-two percent of global insured losses occurred in the United States in the first half, Aon said.
The Polar Vortex-induced period of extreme cold there led to an insured loss of at least $15 billion.
Major storms in western and central Europe in June caused at least $4.5 billion in insured losses, Aon said. 
Floods in Europe since last week have likely caused $2-3 billion in reinsurance losses, analysts say.
Natural disasters were responsible for around 3,000 deaths globally in the first half, with 800 fatalities from the heatwave which hit parts of Western Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest in late June.
""The juxtaposition of observed record heat and cold around the globe highlighted the humanitarian and structural stresses from temperature extremes,"" said Steve Bowen, managing director and head of catastrophe insight on the Impact Forecasting team at Aon.

Bowen added that as a result of climate change, ""it becomes more imperative to explore ways to better manage the physical and non-physical risks that are more urgently requiring actionable solutions"".
British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) called on Wednesday for urgent action from policymakers, developers and insurers to protect homes and businesses from the impact of climate change, saying most were ill-prepared to handle extreme weather.

A significant spike in pre-sale background checks is an indication of a surge in gun sales. Thus, Wall Street analysts are bullish about financially sound gun stocks Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) and Sturm, Ruger and Company (RGR). Based on consensus price targets, these two stocks could rally 20% or more over the next 12 months. So, they could be solid bets now. Read on.As the U.S. continues to make strides in vaccinating its population against COVID-19, activities such as shooting and hunting have returned, resulting in an increasing demand for guns. In addition, gun purchases have risen significantly this year, with many buyers stockpiling guns in anticipation of stricter firearm restrictions under the Biden administration. According to the National Shooting Sports Federation (NSSF), more than two million of the pre-sale background checks in March were for new gun purchases.
The global ammunition market is expected to hit $28.37 billion by 2028, growing at a 3.6% CAGR. Also, small-caliber ammunition penetration is likely to rise in the future due to the growing popularity of sports that use handguns. Gun retailers are expected to witness a substantial surge in sales of rifles too, due to increasing participation in shooting events and increasing consumer interest in hunting activities.
So, Wall Street Analysts are optimistic about the upside potential of several fundamentally sound gun stocks. Two such stocks that they expect to rally more than 20% over the next 12 months are  Vista Outdoor Inc . (VSTO) and Sturm, Ruger and Company Inc. (RGR).

273,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>","J&J forecasts $2.5 billion in 2021 COVID-19 vaccine sales, sets lower production target","By Manas Mishra and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday forecast $2.5 billion in 2021 sales for its COVID-19 shot and set a lower production target for the vaccine as lengthy manufacturing problems took a toll. 
The company now expects to produce 500 million to 600 million doses of its one-shot vaccine this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told CNBC on Wednesday, down from its original goal to produce a billion shots this year.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) offered no timeline on Wednesday for when it would resume production at a problematic Baltimore plant, which had been expected to produce vaccines for Europe and the United States.
The company expects to record more than half of the projected $2.5 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, Wolk said on a conference call to discuss financial results. It reported $164 million in COVID-19 vaccine sales for the second quarter, bringing total sales to $264 million so far.
J&J estimated its vaccine price at $5 per dose in the first half of the year and said it would likely be as much as $8 by year end. The healthcare conglomerate, which promised it would not make a profit on the vaccine during the pandemic, said the fluctuating price reflected the net costs of the vaccine and production volumes.
The $8 price is a bit lower than previous indications. South Africa has said it is paying $10 per dose for both the J&J and the two-shot Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc is charging $3 per shot for its two-dose vaccine.
While the J&J shot was authorized in the United States just a few months after those from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) were cleared, its vaccine sales outlook pales in comparison and reflects the widening gap in the global vaccine race. Pfizer and Moderna have forecast $26 billion and $19.2 billion in annual sales of their vaccines, respectively.
Analysts have said that lower demand for J&J's vaccine should not affect the enormous company's overall financial performance. J&J reported second-quarter earnings per share of $2.35 on sales of $23.3 billion.
Revenue for all the vaccines could jump if health officials determine a round of booster shots is needed should evidence show COVID-19 immunity is waning. 
""It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variants,"" Wolk said. J&J had previously said it expected to be able to make as many as 3 billion vaccine doses in 2022. 
The J&J vaccine appears to be durable for at least eight months and effective against prevalent coronavirus variants, Wolk said, citing recently published data from laboratory studies. 
Because of its one-dose convenience and less onerous storage and shipping requirements, J&J's shot was once touted as an important tool for vaccinations in hard-to-reach areas. But after safety concerns and manufacturing stumbles, it has the lowest uptake in Europe among all the vaccines approved for use, and has also struggled to gain traction in United States.
Its vaccine has been linked to a very rare, potentially life threatening blood clotting condition, similar to AstraZeneca's. U.S. regulators last week also added a warning related to a rare autoimmune disorder.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April said its inspection found a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices in the Baltimore factory run by J&J's subcontractor Emergent BioSolutions Inc, shutting down production.
The FDA has so far approved five batches from the Emergent facility since production there was paused, and J&J is working to clear additional doses for use, Wolk said. 
J&J did not comment on other issues facing the company, including liability lawsuits related to its talc and pelvic mesh products, or the recall of five of its sunscreen products after it detected a cancer-causing chemical in some samples.

Reuters reported on Sunday, citing sources, that the company is exploring a plan to offload liabilities from widespread Baby Powder litigation into a newly created business that would then seek bankruptcy protection.
J&J shares were up 0.2% at $168.80.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to embark on a renewed effort to write ""long overdue"" rules for the registration and regulation of security-based swap execution facilities, Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday.
In a prepared speech, Gensler said he wanted the SEC to harmonize such derivatives rules with similar ones already in place at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He also emphasized that any crypto token or similar product priced off the value of securities must adhere to securities laws, even when offered on a decentralized platform.
""These platforms — whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space — are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime,"" he said in a speech to the American Bar Association.
On swaps, Gensler's remarks inject new life into a long-running project at the SEC to apply stricter oversight to the securities portion of the derivatives market, as directed by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The CFTC has the bulk of responsibility for overseeing derivatives, but the SEC has lagged in its efforts to write required rules for the relatively small portion of the securities-based derivatives market.

Gensler said he had told SEC staff to harmonize its rules with ones already in place at the CFTC, a process that will likely see the SEC put out a fresh proposed rule for public comment. The SEC first proposed rules for securities-based swap execution facilities in 2011.
Gensler said pairing SEC rules with the CFTC regime will be an efficient approach, as many firms affected by new SEC rules already operate under the CFTC regulations.

277,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",Inflation Drumbeat Reverberates on Latest U.S. Earnings Calls,"(Bloomberg) -- Temporary may well extend into 2022.
The outsize gains in U.S. inflation measures that exceeded forecasts over the last four months have been borne out in recent corporate earnings calls, with many executives highlighting greater pricing power.
During the kickoff to the current earnings season, companies including paints and coatings producer PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG)., beverage maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and industrial supplies distributor Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) Co. have telegraphed building price pressures.
“This inflation cycle is much higher than anyone anticipated and we’re continuing on a business by business basis, working to secure further selling price increases,” PPG’s Chief Executive Officer Michael McGarry said on the company’s July 20 earnings call.
Business surveys continue to show elevated input costs as supply of both materials and labor lags behind solid demand. Spot commodities prices remain elevated and wage pressures are building.
On Wednesday, Coke said it’s also feeling the effects of inflated pricing of commodities and materials.
“In 2022 there are more pressures coming at us, and we are working closely with our bottling partners to mitigate some of those pressures,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s difficult to tell how far into 2022 those pressures persist.”
Even as the inflationary drumbeat intensifies, Federal Reserve officials insist they can keep the monetary spigots wide open to ensure stronger roots for the economic recovery.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week that the primary drivers of the recent overshoot of inflation-- including airfares, cars and hotel stays -- will subside.
“We think that those things are clearly temporary,” Powell told the Senate Banking Committee. “We don’t know when they’ll go away. We also don’t know whether there are other things that will come forward and take their place.”
The risk, says JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase’s Jamie Dimon, is that inflation “could be worse than people think.”
“I think it will be a little bit worse than what the Fed thinks,” the bank’s CEO said on the July 13 earnings call. “I don’t think it’s all going to be temporary, but that doesn’t matter if we have very strong growth.”
At Fastenal, officials highlighted tight supply chains, longer delivery times and shipping challenges that are driving up costs that the company is passing on to customers.
“Internationally, there continues to be a shortage of capacity which has made moving products, particularly fasteners, increasingly costly and sustained long lead times,” CFO Holden Lewis said on the company’s July 13 call. This “dynamic could persist” through 2021, he said.
“Price actions to date have largely matched cost increases. There’s a ton of inflation going on. There’s inflation because of disruption,” Fastenal CEO Daniel Florness said.
Executives on Inflation
“This is an atypical level of inflation... It’s the highest inflation level our company has seen in as many years as we can remember.” - Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc. CEO Sean Connolly
“Is there somewhat more inflation out there? There is. Are we going to be pricing to deal with it? We certainly are.” - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. CFO Hugh Johnston
“In order to combat the economic factors we’ve been experiencing, we’ve begun implementing price increases in many of our markets.” - WD-40 Co. CEO Jay Rembolt
“Beyond capacity challenges, we continue to face raw material price increases, due to supply and demand trends and supply chain disruptions.” The company will take “further actions when and if necessary.” - La-Z-Boy Inc. CEO Melinda Whittington
“Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset.” - Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) Co. CEO Harry Lawton
On the company’s earnings call Tuesday,  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). CFO Jack Hartung said the recent menu price increase is “holding strong,” while also noting higher beef, transportation and labor costs in the third quarter.
Almost 74% of the firms surveyed recently by the Philadelphia Fed indicated increases in wages and compensation costs over the past three months, and 57% indicated they were planning to boost pay by more than originally planned.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","Nasdaq profit tops Wall St. view, helped by robust trading","By John McCrank and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Nasdaq Inc on Wednesday reported quarterly profits that topped Wall Street expectations, helped by strong trading levels and increased demand for its financial technology and investment-related products as the economy reopened from the pandemic.
The transatlantic exchange operator's second-quarter adjusted net income of $1.90 per share beat estimates by 15 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Stock market volatility led to higher trading volumes versus a year ago, but activity moderated from the first quarter as COVID-19 lockdowns were eased amid higher vaccination rates.
While some pandemic-related challenges, like a lack of in-person time with clients, remained, demand for Nasdaq's market technology grew from both new and existing customers, said Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman.
""After a year of a lot of volatility and a lot of focus just on the here and now ... the conversations that we're seeing around the world are just much more longer-term driven and more focused on the future,"" she said on a call with analysts.
Initial public offerings continued at a record-setting pace, with more capital raised through IPOs on Nasdaq in the first half of 2021 than in all of 2020.
The exchange welcomed 135 IPOs in the quarter, of which 88 were operating companies like Coinbase Global and AppLovin Corp, while the rest were special purpose acquisition companies.
The increase in IPOs contributes to higher trading levels on Nasdaq, which has around twice the market share in its own listed stocks than in stocks listed on other exchanges, Friedman said.
Revenue from Nasdaq's market services unit, its biggest business, jumped 13% to $312 million, while market technology revenues rose 39% to $117 million.

Investment intelligence revenues increased 23% to $263 million, as investors poured into products tied to Nasdaq's indexes.
Excluding transaction-based expenses, revenue rose 21% to $846 million.

(Reuters) -Harley-Davidson Inc on Wednesday warned soaring raw material prices and supply chain and logistics bottlenecks would hurt its earnings in the second half of the year, prompting a sell-off in its shares.
In the latest quarter, raw material and logistics inflation shaved off 5 points from the U.S. motorcycle maker's profits. The shipping delays, meanwhile, are affecting deliveries of bikes to dealers, hitting sales especially in Europe and Asia.
Harley said the supply chain logjam would keep inventories depleted at company dealerships in the remainder of the year. 
""We're going to sell what we make essentially,"" Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz told investors on an earnings call.
To mitigate the mounting cost pressure, the company will impose an average 2% pricing surcharge from July 1 on some of its bikes sold in the United States.
The measure, however, will not completely offset elevated raw material costs.
Inflation worries overshadowed Harley's better-than-expected earnings in the quarter through June, which offered evidence that Zeitz's turnaround plan was gaining traction.
The company's shares fell after opening higher. They were last trading down 7.3% at $40.61. 
The 118-year-old American brand, which has failed to post sales growth in the United States in the past six years, has shifted focus back to big bikes, traditional markets like the United States and Europe, and to older and wealthier customers in a bid to grow profits.
Although the company's performance in the latest quarter was exaggerated by a favorable statistical base as most of its dealerships in the United States were hit by pandemic-linked lockdowns last year, it offered signs that the new strategy was working.
For example, unit sales of its bikes in the United States - Harley's biggest market - were higher than in the second quarter of 2019.
Similarly, the motorcycle maker substantially reduced the share of cheaper and low-margin models in overall shipments and was able to drive up sales despite spending less on marketing and promotions.
The measures helped mitigate about a $16-million hit in the quarter from increased tariffs on its bikes in the European Union - its second-biggest market.
Harley's products in the EU are now subjected to 31% tariff after a ruling revoked the credentials that allowed it to ship motorcycles to the single currency zone from its international manufacturing facilities at a 6% duty.

Citing the higher tariff, the company revised down operating income guidance from motorcycle sales to 6% to 8% in 2021 from 7%-9% estimated earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Harley earned $1.41 per share in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.17 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Dimon, a cancer survivor, has been at the helm of the Wall Street giant since 2005 and is widely regarded as a leading voice for all things finance. The board gave Dimon new stock awards as a retention incentive.
“In making the special award, the Board considered the importance of Mr. Dimon's continuing, long-term stewardship of the Firm, leadership continuity, and management succession planning amidst a highly competitive landscape for executive leadership talent,” the board said, according to a note JPMorgan sent to the SEC.
During Dimon’s tenure, JPMorgan’s total net revenue has more than doubled to $122.9 billion from $54.53 billion and its asset size has grown to $3.02 trillion from $1.19 trillion.
The bank awarded Dimon 1.5 million in stock awards that can't be exercised for at least five years."

(Reuters) -U.S. health insurer Anthem on Wednesday warned of potentially higher COVID-19 costs in the second half of the year in the light of new coronavirus variants coupled with a slowing vaccination rate in the country. 
The company's comments come after lower-than-expected medical costs helped it beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit and raise its adjusted earnings forecast for the year by 40 cents. 
Health insurers have been conservative in their 2021 outlooks as they expect fluctuations in medical costs due to the impact of virus variants and new outbreaks in some parts of the country, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. 
""There's still a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding COVID in the back half of the year and so we obviously want to maintain a prudent, if not cautious, posture,"" Anthem Chief Financial Officer John Gallina said.
The company backed its expectations of $600 million in COVID-19 costs in 2021. 
Last week, larger rival UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) said it still expects a $1.80 per share hit to this year's profit due to COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, even as it raised full-year earnings target.
Health insurers seem to be adding in some additional earnings cushion for the second half by not raising by the full amount of the second-quarter beat, given the potential for medical costs to continue to rise, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.

Anthem on Wednesday became the latest large U.S. health insurer after UnitedHealth to say it was still watching out for additional guidance on Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s newly approved $56,000 Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm.
The U.S. government's Medicare program and private health insurers, which sell Medicare Advantage plans for those over 65 years of age, will be bearing most of the drug's cost and delayed decision on its coverage could slow its uptake by patients.

So, we think it could be wise to avoid Airbnb (ABNB), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), United Airlines (UAL), and Norwegian Cruise (NCHL) because they are vulnerable to significant price declines on their weak financials and bleak growth prospects. So, let’s evaluate these names’ prospects more closely.The COVID-19 Delta variant has already driven up infections internationally. And this month the United States also witnessed a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, through the spread of the Delta variant. According to CDC data, the United States has averaged more than 26,000 new cases per day over the past seven days, up from an 11,000 cases per day seven-day average a month earlier.
Although there has been solid progress on the vaccination front in the U.S., investors are concerned about the possibility of the hyper-infectious variant of the COVID-19 virus delaying economic recovery. Based in-part on this concern, the stock market has been witnessing the most intense selling pressure since October, with airlines, hotels, and travel-related stocks the most affected. All three major benchmark indexes have seen a level of correction over the past week.
Against this backdrop, we think investors should avoid fundamentally weak stocks Airbnb Inc. (ABNB), AMC, Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC), United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd . (NYSE:NCLH). They could suffer a major pullback on their weak fundamentals and growth prospects.

Newspaper Sole 24 Ore had reported the investigation on Wednesday and the judicial sources confirmed the details of the report. 
The judicial sources said Italy's tax police allege LIA had failed to disclose to domestic tax authorities income worth around 500 million euros ($589 million).
The prosecutors are also investigating allegations that some of the money that LIA's customers have invested in insurance policies was obtained illegally, the judicial sources said.
""LIA acts in full compliance with all the relevant laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,"" the company said in an emailed response to a Reuters request for comment.
LIA said it always cooperated with authorities and that it operated in Italy through a secondary Milan-based arm.
The sources said the tax police believed LIA's operations in Italy were such that warranted paying taxes in the country.

The judicial sources also said the investigation into LIA was one of several similar investigations in the insurance sector and followed similar probes in the banking sector which have yielded more than 300 million euros in revenues for Italy's tax authorities.

Recently, IPOs have underperformed, but it could be an opportunity to add two high-quality ones - ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM) and ZipRecruiter (ZIP).In many ways, 2021 has been a mirror image of 2020 especially in terms of the major trends impacting the stock market. A notable example is the performance of IPOs. From the March 2020 bottom, the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) finished 2020 with a 221% gain. In 2021, IPO has a YTD loss of 8%. To compare, the S&P 500 has a YTD gain of 14.6%. 
Following the market bottom, tech and growth stocks were in vogue as these companies benefitted from the decline in longer-term rates, the Fed’s ultra-dovish policies and the increase in tech spending as people were spending more time online and working from home. Of course, the majority of IPOs can be classified as growth stocks, and technology accounted for the majority of new issues in 2020. The shutdowns and stimulus payments also led to many people taking an interest in trading stocks. Many ended up buying more speculative stocks including IPOs. 
This year, the economy’s gradual reopening and strength in longer-term rates led to the unwind of these catalysts, so it’s not surprising that IPOs have underperformed. However, some are attractively priced and have considerable upside. Further, the recent drop in longer-term rates should also be supportive of IPOs in the coming months. Therefore, investors should consider buying the following IPOs on the dip: ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM) and ZipRecruiter (ZIP).

(Reuters) -Shares of energy services firm Baker Hughes slipped on Wednesday after reporting second quarter results that fell short of Wall Street estimates as it shifts its business to technology and services that help customers transition to a lower carbon world. 
Baker Hughes Co swung to a profit from a loss a year-ago, but was down 9% from the prior quarter and missed analysts forecasts. Earnings were hurt by $125 million in impairment and restructuring charges.
Shares slipped 1% to $19.86. Brent crude futures were up about 2% on Wednesday to $70.77 per barrel. [O/R]
While oil demand has rebounded from the pandemic lows seen last year, spending on oilfield services has only inched higher as energy companies hold spending and production flat. 
The recovery in oil demand may face a threat from new strains of COVID-19, but spending and activity should gain momentum through the year as the business environment improves, Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement.
Baker Hughes is rebranding itself as an energy transition company, focusing on technology and shedding some traditional oilfield businesses. Revenue at its oilfield services unit was down about 2% year-over-year, while oilfield equipment revenue dipped 8% over that period. 
In oilfield services, Simonelli projected high single-digit to low double-digit percentage growth in international markets in the second half of the year and modest growth in North American markets. He anticipates companies will add around 50 rigs in North America through the end of the year, with private companies picking up activity at current price levels. 
Adjusted net income attributable to the company was $83 million, or 10 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with $91 million, or 12 cents per share, in the first quarter. Wall Street analysts had anticipated earnings of 16 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Revenue of $5.142 billion for the quarter topped forecasts of $4.948 billion, according to Refinitiv. 

Overall, Wall Street analysts said the results were neutral to positive, pointing to stronger profit margins and free cash flow. 
Investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co called the report ""solid"" and lauded Baker's continued focus on technological innovation and the energy transition.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 10:22AM ET</span>",SoftBank's robotics ambitions short circuit as Pepper loses power,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) -When SoftBank Group Corp's CEO Masayoshi Son unveiled the wide-eyed android Pepper in 2014, he painted a vision, once confined to science fiction, of a new era of personal robots in which his company would be the industry leader. 
That vision, and the company's expectations of demand for Pepper, proved overly optimistic, two sources familiar with the matter said. Seven years later, Pepper is clinging to life, with production shuttered and units cobbled together with out-of-date components. 
SoftBank will end sales of new Pepper units in 2023 at the latest as those parts become obsolete, according to the minutes of an internal meeting held in Paris in late May and reviewed by Reuters. Sales of refurbished units will continue after this point, management told staff.
The company disputed the meeting minutes, and Kazutaka Hasumi, chief marketing officer of SoftBank Robotics, told Reuters the company is committed to ensuring Pepper survives in some form, perhaps with a new design. 
""We will still be selling Pepper in five years,"" Hasumi said.
The humanoid was custom designed for SoftBank by Aldebaran, a French robotics startup it acquired in 2012. Son hoped Pepper would transform robots from a factory tool into an everyday companion, just as computers had moved from offices into homes and pockets. 
But Pepper's appeal was limited by its basic functionality: it can make rudimentary conversation, engage in simple interactions through its chest-mounted tablet and sing while gesturing. It would frequently break down, the two sources said.
""Pepper wasn't upgraded to take on real tasks. There was very little Pepper could do that you can't do with an iPad,"" said Morten Paulsen, head of Japan research at CLSA. 
Retailing for 198,000 yen ($1,800) plus a 14,800 yen monthly fee, Pepper was out of reach for most households, and SoftBank was quickly forced to focus on businesses. Pepper was met with some early enthusiasm in that sector; shops and restaurants offered a more predictable environment where the robot could be programmed for tasks such as greeting customers. 
But poor relations between Tokyo and Paris hurt Pepper's development, according to the sources familiar with the matter, and two others. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not permitted to speak to the media. 
SoftBank propped up Pepper's sales in the early days deploying units in its mobile phone stores said two of the sources. 27,000 units were eventually produced, one of the two sources familiar with the matter said. 
Now, sales of Pepper have slumped to less than 100 units in some months, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. 
Production at a Foxconn factory in China was stopped last year as the number of unsold units mounted and the line has since been shut down, the documents show. 
SoftBank has fewer than 2,000 Pepper units left, according to the documents. The heavy batteries that power the robot are decaying and the chest-mounted tablets run on an out-of-date Android operating system without the latest security updates, one of the sources said. 
ELECTRIC DREAMS
Son, a self described ""big talker"", has a track record of achieving the unlikely, breaking up Japan's telecoms duopoly and securing $60 billion in Middle Eastern oil money for his Vision Fund.
The billionaire also has an eye for hits, famously bringing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s first iPhone to the Japanese market. But when his company launched Pepper, it had little experience designing and building products - let alone androids. 
And the expected market never materialised. Even as Pepper helped spread SoftBank's name around the world, some customers were returning it when lease periods ended. 
Two years ago SoftBank made a major attempt to reboot its robotics business with the launch of Whiz, an automated vacuum cleaner. 
Sales staff struggled to persuade customers to pay $500 monthly for a product that could only clean open spaces and would break down, two other sources said. 
Demand for Whiz has been boosted by the pandemic, with orders for 8,000 units in the April-June quarter, said Kenichi Yoshida, chief business officer at SoftBank Robotics. 
SoftBank has considered other robot products, including one that makes ramen, the two sources said. It sells a food service robot, Servi, developed by California-based Bear Robotics, that can carry food to diners. 
PURE INVESTING 
The underperformance at SoftBank Robotics came to a head last year as the downturn forced Son to change strategy, selling assets to stabilise the group's balance sheet and pushing portfolio companies to prioritise cash generation.
SoftBank Robotics embarked on a global restructuring, reported by Reuters last month, that includes plans to cut half of its Paris-based workforce.
The business is nearing profitability and listing is a possibility, Yoshida said. 
The conglomerate has been shifting to pure investing through its Vision Fund and has sold down majority stakes in firms like Boston Dynamics. It continues to take smaller stakes in robotics related businesses. 
SoftBank has struck sales deals with partners such as Iris Ohyama in Japan and RobotLAB in the U.S. There is a niche market for selling Pepper to corporate clients and in education, Elad Inbar, CEO of RobotLAB, said in an interview.

""Our job in this ecosystem is to show that there is market demand,"" he said.

The burrito restaurant chain expects third-quarter comparable sales growth in the low to mid double-digits range. During the calendar year, it also hopes to have opened 200 or more restaurants.
Revenue increased 39%, to $1.9 billion, and comparable restaurant sales rose 31% as customers came back after a year of the pandemic. Digital sales and menu price increases also helped boost revenue.
Net income for the second quarter was $188 million, a 23-times increase from $8.2 million in the June quarter of 2020. Lower promotional expenses and cheaper beef aided higher earnings.
According to Chipotle Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, in-restaurant sales recovered strongly as customers reacted positively to its new menu items. A low base last year also made the 2021 quarter’s numbers look more impressive.
Digital sales grew 10.5% year over year to $916.5 million and represented 48.5% of sales. A little more than half of the digital sales were from order ahead transactions as guests took to the convenience of the platform.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $7.46, a near 19-fold jump from the same quarter a year ago."

(Reuters) - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co has not seen any direct sales impact after Portugal soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo removed two bottles of its soda placed in front of him at a Euro 2020 press conference in June, the beverage giant's finance chief said on Wednesday.
Ronaldo, a health fanatic with an aversion to carbonated drinks, snubbed the brand by holding a bottle of water and saying ""agua"", Portuguese and Spanish for water. His action sent the internet into a frenzy and briefly wiped off billions of dollars from the company's market capitalization.
""You have to take the long view on these partnerships. You're always going to have some events that don't necessarily go your way and we just deal with them and manage them as such,"" Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in an interview.

""Our commitment to these major tournaments has not been affected,"" Murphy added.
The soda maker raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts on Wednesday, as demand bounces back from pandemic lows for its beverages following the re-opening of theaters, restaurants and stadiums.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>","Drugmakers, pharmacies next targets for U.S. opioid settlements","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a $26 billion nationwide settlement in sight over claims that the three largest U.S. drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) helped fuel a nationwide opioid epidemic, state and local governments will soon turn their attention to pharmacies and a handful of drugmakers.
U.S. state attorneys general are expected to unveil a settlement proposal this week with distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp contributing a combined $21 billion, while Johnson & Johnson would pay $5 billion.
The ultimate settlement price-tag could fluctuate depending on how many state and local governments agree to the deal or reject it to pursue litigation on their own.
More than 3,000 lawsuits, mostly by local governments, have been filed over the opioid crisis against a range of companies for allegedly downplaying the risk of the drugs and for lax controls that allowed the highly addictive painkillers to flood communities.
Excluded from the potential $26 billion deal are pharmacy operators including Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), which have been accused of ignoring red flags that opioid drugs were being diverted into illegal channels.
The deal also would not include drugmakers  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd or Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc, which have been accused of misleadingly marketing their pain medicines as safe.
Nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC last week said provisional data showed that 2020 was a record year for overall drug overdose deaths with 93,331, up 29% from a year earlier.
The pharmacies and drugmakers have denied the claims, saying rising opioid prescriptions were driven by doctors, that they followed federal law and that the known risks were included in U.S.-approved labels for the drugs.
News of the proposed nationwide settlement came three weeks into a jury trial in New York, and legal experts said upcoming court proceedings will pressure the remaining defendants to reach a deal.
The drugmakers are currently defending themselves at the New York trial and a trial in Orange County, California, and are expected to face another trial in San Francisco along with the pharmacies later this year. The pharmacies, which settled the New York case shortly before trial, also face an October trial in Ohio.
Endo is scheduled to go to trial next week to assess damages over a lawsuit brought on behalf of Tennessee counties and an infant allegedly born addicted to opioids, in which a judge has already ruled the company liable. District Attorney General Barry Staubus of Tennessee's Sullivan County told WHLJ television that the company offered to settle, but the deal would be limited to that case.
'COMMON GOAL' TO END EPIDEMIC
Richard Ausness, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said a settlement this week reduces the groups of defendants in the litigation and makes it harder for the remaining companies to blame others.
""It puts pressure on them to reach a deal, especially if the mechanics were formulated in this present settlement,” he said.
Peter Mougey, a lawyer representing the local governments pursuing opioid litigation around the country, said at a news conference to discuss proposed settlements that he was ""frustrated"" pharmacies were not part of the nationwide deal.
""They've had ample time to assess where they are with their liability, and we all have the common goal of trying to end this opioid epidemic,"" he said.
The pharmacies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
In 2019, Teva proposed a settlement in which it would donate addiction treatment drugs that it valued at $23 billion. Industry analysts said the actual cost of the drugs to Teva could be as little as $1.5 billion, however, and plaintiffs' lawyers balked at what they called an inflated valuation.
Joe Rice, another plaintiffs' lawyer, said Teva had not been involved in settlement talks since early 2020 but that plaintiffs hoped to negotiate with them going forward.
Teva said in a statement on Tuesday that it remained ""confident"" it would reach a deal involving donated drugs, and that it would defend itself against ""unfounded claims"" in the meantime.
""Now more than ever - with local state government budgets dramatically impacted by COVID - it is clear that donated medicines provide the holistic approach needed for solving the epidemic of addiction,"" the Israel-based company said.

AbbVie and Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on settlement negotiations.
Other settlements are also being negotiated with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and generic opioid maker  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) Plc now working through the bankruptcy courts to secure support for settlements worth more than $10 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday after a generally strong barrage of corporate earnings ensured that Tuesday's rebound extended into the new session. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 181 points, or 0.5%, at 34,693 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. 
The Nasdaq's underperformance was down in part to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), whose disappointing subscriber growth forecast for the next quarter was a sober reminder that the sugar rush enjoyed by winners from the pandemic can't last forever.
Netflix stock was one of very few in the red, losing 2.6%. Another was Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock, which fell 4.1% after the motorcycle maker revised down its operating income forecast due to the impact of EU tariffs. 
Most other companies to report over the last few hours saw their stock prices rise, however. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) stock rose 8.5%, as reopened restaurants and rebounding sales more than outweighed warnings about higher input costs, from both raw materials and labor.  Likewise, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock rose 1.1% after it reported steady progress in the uptake of its 5G services, while United Airlines  (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 3.7% after it reported a sharp narrowing of its net loss in the second quarter. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock rose 2.4% as the reopening of economies across the world lifted sales across all its product lines. 
The market was undaunted by reports suggesting that the $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill pushed by Senate Democrats is unlikely to pass a procedural vote later Wednesday that would block the risk of a filibuster. Nor was it fazed by a fresh drop in weekly mortgage applications, a further sign that the red-hot housing market may be cooling off. Thirty-year mortgage rates have come down by some 25 basis points since April, as fears about inflation have given way to concerns about the sustainability of the economic recovery.
""This is going to sound odd but Monday's selloff was the best news that happened to the markets this year,"" said Lena Komileva of G+ Economics, via Twitter. ""It was cathartic: markets have priced out the reopening and discounted the recovery.""
European ADRs were also broadly stronger after some notable second-quarter releases. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch company that makes printing machines for semiconductors, rose 3.2% after raising its revenue growth forecast for this year to 35%, a clear sign of its ability to push up prices as chipmakers scramble for additional capacity. Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) however underperformed after the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks warned that third-quarter sales would fall due to the short-term shortage of chips.
Elsewhere, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV)ADRs rose 7.0%, in what appeared a delayed reaction to the launch of the electric vehicle maker's new sedan in China at a price that undercuts Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3 comfortably. Xpeng earlier this month completed a public offering in Hong Kong that has changed the dynamic of price formation for the ADRs, in that Chinese investors now get to react first to the company's news.

Investing.com – Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock rose 2% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the telecom operator revised its guidance for both earnings and revenue.
A subscriber base willing to pay more for high-speed 5G services and devices was behind the company giving a more promising outlook.
The company now expects annual wireless service revenue to grow between 3.5% and 4% as against 3% forecast earlier. Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now seen in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 compared to previous forecast of $5 to $5.15.
The company net added 275,000 subscribers on its postpaid service during the June quarter. Telecom companies prefer postpaid users as they are locked into monthly bills that carry certain fixed charges. Such users also tend to stick longer to a service.
The company also managed to milk every user more. Postpaid and prepaid revenue earned from each account rose 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively.
Total revenue in the June quarter rose 11% year-on-year to $33.8 billion. Net income climbed 23% to $5.94 billion and adjusted EPS was $1.37. Both revenue and EPS beat estimates."

The former UBS investment banker has focused on simplifying the structure of UniCredit, Italy's only bank deemed of global significance by supervisors. The bank also has operations in Germany, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe.
Within a month of arriving, Orcel had on May 12 unveiled an overhaul of UniCredit's top management structure, bringing in former lieutenants, axing co-heads and slashing the number of internal committees.
At the time, he confirmed Richard Burton as head of Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB).
Burton told staff in a message to staff on Wednesday that he was streamlining his reporting lines and downsizing the CIB executive committee to facilitate ""faster decision-making processes with clear accountability.""
UniCredit named Goffredo Guizzardi sole head of CIB's Financing and Advisory division, while former co-head Christian Reusch was moved to a new role. 
Similarly, Luca Corsini will become the sole head of CIB's Global Transaction Banking, with his former co-head Giovanni Solaroli now in charge of Transaction Banking Solutions Italy.

Investing.com – Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock was up 2.5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the company raised its annual sales forecast after second-quarter volume numbers surpassed those of April-June 2020.
As the pandemic waned in most regions, people stepped out and away-from-home consumption rose. Both aerated and non-aerated drinks benefited.
The company said overall, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew 15% year-to-date.
Coca-Cola grew 12%, putting volumes ahead of their 2019 level. Sparkling soft drinks grew 14%.
Much bigger growth was seen in hydration and sports drinks, nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, reflecting the people’s focus on health in the aftermath of the pandemic. They all grew by between 20% and 35%.
The varying levels of growth across beverages was also because various geographies, with their own preference for a particular drink, reopened at different intervals. So, sports drinks grew in North America and tea consumption rose in the U.S. and Japan and Brazil. Coffee grew 78% in the U.K. as Costa retail stores reopened after the lockdown.  
Coca-Cola expects to deliver organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%-15% in the ongoing financial year.

The antitrust was focusing on the December 2019-January 2021 period and the company has reduced or scrapped tolls on routes under maintenance since 2020, ASPI said in a statement in response to the opening of the inquiry.
The highway operator said this decision over tolls had led to a revenue drop of 77 million euros ($90.64 million) for the company over 2020-2021.
The watchdog had already fined the motorway operator 5 million euros in March for not cutting the tolls for highway sections ""with considerable traffic problems"" due to road works, it said in a statement.

Firms like Ethos saw a huge uptick in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, as insurance companies were forced to rely on technology to reach customers. It witnessed a more than six-fold increase in its revenue and customer base year-over-year.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mostly higher Wednesday, making a further recovery from Monday’s sharp losses despite disappointing results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 140 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 20 points, or 0.1%.
The major equity indices had rebounded strongly on Tuesday from Monday’s Covid-inspired selloff, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost 550 points, its best day in more than a month, largely making back the previous day’s 700-point slump.
The second-quarter corporate earnings season is now in full swing, and a lot of Wednesday’s focus will be on Netflix after the streaming giant reported a net drop of 430,000 subscribers in the important North American market in the quarter. It also forecast 3.5 million net subscriber adds in the current quarter,  well below market expectations of nearly 5 million.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) will also be in the spotlight after the fast food chain impressed with its quarterly results as dine-in customers returned to its restaurants, but warned that higher costs will offset the benefit of the hikes in menu prices in the near term.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) forecast just $2.5 billion in 2021 sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) raised its full-year outlook after the fast food giant reported strong second-quarter revenue, while numbers are also expected from the likes of Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).
Elsewhere, oil prices strengthened Wednesday, rebounding after recent losses even after a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, at a time when rising Covid-19 infections threaten the demand outlook.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis beat second-quarter sales and profit expectations on Wednesday, while keeping its 2021 guidance unchanged, as disruption from the coronavirus pandemic waned.
""While demand is starting to return to pre-COVID-19 levels in most geographies and therapeutic areas, we still see a slight impact on parts of our business for example in oncology, generics and certain geographies,"" it said.
""We are assuming further easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the second half of the year with a positive impact on business dynamics.""
Finance chief Harry Kirsch told reporters that the pandemic was still weighing, for instance, on cancer patients' diagnostic rates, which crimped sales of products sold via hospitals.
He estimated business was probably averaging 80-90% of pre-COVID levels, with strong divergences by category and country.
Novartis boosted core net profit by a fifth to $3.72 billion. Core operating income rose 18% to $4.35 billion. The gain of 13% in constant currencies was up around 4% excluding the impact of destocking in the year-earlier quarter after customers rushed to lay in supplies early last year, it said. 
Sales in the three months through June rose 14% to $12.96 billion, a gain of 9% when stripping out currency fluctuations. 
Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average expected net profit of $3.46 billion on revenue of $12.52 billion.
Novartis said its key drug brands were performing well and its product development pipeline continued to progress.
It reiterated it expected 2021 sales to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate at constant currencies, with core operating income growing at a mid-single digit rate.

Its shares rose 2.2% in early trading, ahead of the European health care sector index, which was up 0.9%.
Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said results clearly beat expectations but the company's failure to upgrade its guidance ""indicates that the pandemic situation has not yet returned fully to pre-pandemic levels and that the situation remains somewhat unpredictable due to the emerging variants"".

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 06:53AM ET</span>",Analysis - Biogen Alzheimer's drug slow to take off as U.S. Medicare wrestles with coverage,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - U.S. hospitals that were expected to be early adopters of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug have treated only a handful of patients since its early June approval as they wait for the first payments from the government’s Medicare program for people aged 65 and older.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, called Aduhelm, based on limited evidence that it might slow a decline in cognitive function in people with the memory-robbing disease.
Some prominent doctors, hospitals and health insurers have criticized the FDA decision and said they will not offer the drug. The agency itself has invited an outside investigation into its decision-making process.
Other leading institutions, including in Michigan, Florida and Rhode Island, were eager to make the therapy available to patients in the hope it will provide a benefit, but told Reuters this week they are proceeding slowly while Medicare determines how it will cover Aduhelm, initially priced at about $56,000 per year.
Medicare has launched a nine-month process to set standardized national terms for Aduhelm coverage that may seek to limit its use.
For now, the government health plan is processing claims for the drug on a case-by-case basis. The first centers to use the drug as a commercial product said those claims have not yet been paid.
""Medicare does this very, very rarely for drugs and issues these coverage restrictions, again, very rarely,"" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Brigham and Women’s Hospital during an online interview presented jointly by The Forum at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Reuters. Kesselheim resigned as a member of the FDA advisory panel that reviewed Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s drug after the agency chose not to follow it recommendation against approval.
The slow uptake raises questions about the potential for 2021 sales for the treatment ahead of Biogen’s second-quarter earnings report on Thursday.
'BEING VERY CAUTIOUS'
The Michigan Institute for Neurological Disorders (MIND) said it has only treated one patient with Aduhelm.
Sonda Rossman, head of disease state initiatives, therapeutics, and clinical research at MIND, said the institute is testing more patients for Aduhelm eligibility, but is ""being very cautious"" about financial, as well as medical, risks.
Florida's First Choice Neurology and Butler Hospital's Memory and Aging Program in Providence, Rhode Island, have treated three patients each. Butler's program is run by Dr. Steven Salloway, an Aduhelm supporter who has called the drug's approval ""a turning point in Alzheimer’s research.""
The Mayo Clinic, which has partnered with Biogen to provide clinical testing to diagnose whether someone is eligible for the new medication, said it is still reviewing whether to offer Aduhelm to its own patients.
The FDA approved Aduhelm for patients who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques, but later narrowed that to just those in the early stages of the disease - the group tested in clinical trials.
UCLA Health System said none of its providers have asked to use Aduhelm, with many awaiting additional data before making a final decision.
Biogen declined to comment on the number of centers using its drug, but said it expects the rollout to be gradual.
MEDICARE LIMITS
Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people eligible for Aduhelm are covered by Medicare, which could incur a $29 billion annual spending increase, according to Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Experts say Medicare could seek to lower the therapy's cost to taxpayers by limiting access to the treatment, linking coverage to real-world evidence of patient outcomes, or setting a fixed payment that combines drug reimbursement with other costs related to the treatment.
""Given the potential budgetary impact, it could be that things are departing from normal,"" said Dan Ollendorf, of the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts University Medical Center in Boston. 
Tufts and others have called for Medicare to go beyond a national coverage determination and institute a policy known as coverage with evidence development.
Under such a program, data on Aduhelm's real-world effectiveness and safety would be compiled in a Medicare patient registry, quickly providing new data to analyze.

Medicare could also institute a stricter ""demonstration project"" for Aduhelm that would pay for the drug's use at a limited number of medical centers and for a fixed amount that bundles in costs for scans, follow-up and to monitor for side effects.
While Medicare is prevented by law from negotiating drug prices, this type of approach could limit reimbursement to hospitals, possibly at an amount below Aduhelm's list price. That could put pressure on Biogen to cut the price if it wants Aduhelm to be used, said Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins.

STOCKHOLM/BEIJING (Reuters) -Volvo Cars has struck a deal to buy out parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding from their joint ventures in China, in a move that could make a potential initial public offering (IPO) for the Swedish automaker more attractive to investors. 
Hangzhou-based Geely, which also owns a 9.7% stake in Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), said earlier this year it was considering options for Volvo, including an IPO and stock market listing. In February, Geely's Hong Kong-listed unit Geely Automobile and Volvo Cars scrapped plans to merge.
""These two transactions will create a clearer ownership structure within both Volvo Cars and Geely Holding,"" Geely's CEO Daniel Li said in a statement, which did not refer to the possible IPO.
Analysts expect other foreign automakers to strike similar deals in China, the world's biggest car market, when the country's requirement for auto manufacturing to be carried out with a local joint venture partner is lifted next year. 
Such rules for electric carmakers have already been lifted, allowing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to already make and sell vehicles via fully-owned operations in China. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has gained control of an electric car unit in the eastern city of Hefei.
Volvo Cars' deal, financial terms for which were not disclosed, will give it full ownership of its manufacturing plants in Chengdu and Daqing, its Chinese sales company and its research and development facility in Shanghai.
Volvo Cars sold over 166,000 vehicles in China last year, and its dealers are offering heavy discounts to compete with other premium brands like BMW and Audi. 
The Gothenburg-based company was bought by Geely from Ford in the aftermath of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, and has since shared ownership of its Chinese plants with its parent.

Volvo Cars said the transactions, which are subject to regulatory approval, would be carried out in two steps, starting in 2022 and seen formally completed in 2023.
Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in June https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volvo-cars-ev-road-map-includes-better-batteries-longer-range-2021-06-30 the company was making progress towards a possible IPO later in 2021, and that while it would continue to share platforms and components with Geely, they would do so at ""an arm's length distance,"" consistent with the way independent companies do business.

A net loss of $434 million in the three-month period was the airline’s sixth consecutive but much less than $1.62 billion a year earlier, when the pandemic was raging and airlines across the world were grounded. The airline flew over eight times more passengers in the June quarter from a year ago.
Operating revenue jumped more than three-and-a-half times to $5.47 billion as economies reopened and passengers took to travelling again.
The airline expects to offer 39% more capacity in the current quarter but that would still be more than 25% below 2019 levels.
Based on current trends, the company expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) - a key measure of capacity utilization - to be up versus the third quarter of 2019 in the current three months. That would be the first period of positive TRASM growth in over a year.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish forestry firm Stora Enso (OTC:SEOAY) on Wednesday reported stronger than expected second-quarter core earnings and revenue as higher prices helped to drive strong profit growth in pulp, packaging and wood products.
Chief Financial Officer Seppo Parvi told Reuters he sees the strong demand continuing beyond the coronavirus pandemic that boosted house renovations, takeaway eating and online shopping.
""We see the demand continuing strong in packaging, wood products and construction even after the pandemic and the European Union forest strategy and climate package only support that,"" Parvi told Reuters, referring to the EU climate plan announced last week.
Stora's shares rose nearly 3% early on Wednesday but later in the session they were down 0.30%. 
""The Q2 numbers were clearly above estimates due to the very strong development in these cyclical segments. It is safe to say this will not go on forever,"" analyst Antti Viljakainen from Inderes said, adding that pulp prices in China have already declined somewhat.
""The stock market is now weighing up how much the strong result will indicate what will happen in the coming quarters,"" Viljakainen told Reuters. 
Stora said its second-quarter operating profit rose to 364 million euros ($428.32 million) from 178 million a year ago, beating the 302.2-million-euro estimate of 9 analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
Stora's sales rose 22.6% to 2.59 billion euros, with its biomaterials (pulp) unit up 57%, wood products 37.7% and both packaging material units up more than 20%.
The analysts had estimated the revenue to be 2.35 billion euros. 
Stora's paper business sales remained stable year-on-year but it made a loss of 49 million euros. 
Parvi told Reuters that Stora sees the situation improving after closing paper mills in Finland and Sweden and finalising the sale of a third mill in Germany by the end of the ongoing third quarter.

The company also said its Oulu mill in northern Finland, which was converted to make packaging cardboard instead of paper, had broken even in the third quarter, three quarters ahead of Stora's initial expectation.

LONDON (Reuters) -A global shortage of semiconductor chips will dent car sales in the second half of 2021 and will extend into 2022,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said on Wednesday, but the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles left unchanged its profit margin outlook for this year.
Along with other carmakers, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) cut back production this year because of a chip shortage during the coronavirus pandemic, prompting the German company to focus on higher-margin models.
Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told investors that although the chip shortage would last into 2022, it would be less severe than this year.
The premium carmaker, which also faces the challenge of high prices for steel, copper and aluminium in the second half of 2021, said its visibility into how chip supply would develop was currently low.
""Improving supply visibility is a top priority for us,"" Chief Executive Ola Källenius told a conference call with analysts and investors, although he said the chip shortage ""is a fixable problem.""
The shortage comes as demand for cars has spiked during the global economy's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, driving up prices of new and used vehicles as inventories shrink. 
Some carmakers have adapted to the chip shortage by dropping some features from their models. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said in March some pickup trucks would not have a fuel management module, hurting their fuel economy performance. 
Other, including Daimler, have produced vehicles that are still waiting for chips so they can be completed.
""We have some unfinished cars, but we have not let this balloon out of proportion,"" Källenius said. 
Mercedes-Benz car sales in the second quarter jumped 27%, with a 54% jump in Europe, Daimler's second market after China.
After soaring in late 2020 and the first quarter, Mercedes-Benz sales in China gained just 5.8% in the second quarter.
Källenius said order books for the flagship S-class sedans were ""very healthy"". But he said the supply chain issues ""are holding us back.""
The company said it expected full-year car sales to be in line with 2020 levels, after previously forecasting car unit sales this year would be significantly above last year's.
Daimler said 2021 adjusted profit margins at its truck and bus division would be between 6% and 7%, which is below its previous forecast for a range of 6% to 8%.
The company confirmed second-quarter adjusted group earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at 5.42 billion euros ($6.38 billion), with car and truck divisions beating analyst targets. 

Daimler reported preliminary results last week.

(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s first-half results should give a sign of how the consumer goods giant is coping with soaring commodity and transport costs - whether it has managed to lift prices without hitting sales volumes, or whether margins are being squeezed. 
But Thursday's results will also be vying for an attention with an ongoing row over the decision of the group's American ice-cream brand Ben & Jerry's to stop marketing its products in the occupied Palestinian territories - a move that has sparked a backlash in Israel.
Analysts expect the Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise maker to report a 1.2 percentage point drop in underlying operating margins from a year ago, according to a company supplied consensus. Pantry stocking and a surge in eating-at-home during pandemic lockdowns last year allowed Unilever to cut back on marketing and store promotions, boosting margins. But soaring commodity costs for everything from plastics to tea and nuts in the first half of 2021 have put a question mark over its full-year goal to lift margins ""slightly"" from last year. 
The company reported underlying operating margins of 18.5% in 2020. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Martin Deboo expects Unilever's commodity costs to have surged 9.8% in the first half, up from his initial forecast of 7.4%, due mainly to higher prices of plastics, ethylene oxide and palm oils used in manufacturing and packaging its beauty and personal care products. Raw material and packaging costs account for 40% of Unilever's overall sales. 
""We continue to view 2021 as the year of most significant cost challenge to the industry since 2011,"" Deboo said. While Unilever raised prices by 1% in the first quarter, in areas such as teas and high-inflation Latin American countries, analysts say the impact is expected to be felt only later this year, leaving it with a hefty first-half commodities bill. 
Unilever is expected to raise prices further, but its initial hikes are already weakening sales volumes in countries such as Brazil,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts noted in a research report earlier this month. Emerging markets, including Brazil, India and China, make up 60% of group sales. ""Whilst these higher input costs are known, the exact actual impact on margins will have been hard to estimate so poses an additional risk to coming results, not just for the impact of this quarter but also what it means for the second-half,"" said Tineke Frikkee, head of UK Equity research at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management.
Despite the pressures, Unilever said in April it was confident of delivering full-year underlying sales growth within its mid-term target range of 3-5%, with the first half around the top of the range.
Some analysts are less bullish, however, citing suppressed consumption of ice-cream outside the home due to a cold April and wet May in northern Europe.
Before the pandemic, out-of-home ice-cream sales accounted for 8% of the group total, with the second quarter a big chunk of that.

(Reuters) -Royal Mail Plc said Britons are having fewer parcels delivered to their homes as pandemic curbs are lifted and it withheld from offering an annual outlook for its UK business due to COVID-19 uncertainties, sending shares down 2% to two-month lows.
It also warned on Wednesday that revenue growth at its more profitable international division would taper off this year, even as it reported a 12.5% rise in group revenue in the first quarter.
The company said parcel volumes in its UK business fell 13% in the three months ended June 30 from a year ago, with international shipments coming into Britain affected by Brexit, reduced air freight capacity and higher transport costs.
""We continue to expect fluctuations in volumes as we emerge from COVID restrictions, which we will need to manage accordingly,""  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) Chairman Keith Williams said.
Postal companies such as Royal Mail, UPS, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), DHL and e-commerce firm Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw demand for their home delivery services surge as governments worldwide imposed strict lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic over the past year.
But as the British government has gradually lifted restrictions since April, people have returned to shopping malls and high streets.
Research firm Third Bridge analyst Ben Nuttall said there were early signs that online buying behaviour was sticking, with Royal Mail's domestic parcels in the first quarter still up 19% on 2019 levels.
""In the medium-term, one of the key challenges for Royal Mail is its low level of parcel automation,"" he said.
Royal Mail is constructing two fully-automated parcel hubs which are expected to be operational in 2023 in Warrington and Daventry.

Royal Mail stuck to its 2021 revenue growth forecast for GLS, its worldwide ground-based parcel network, even as the postal company said it will begin to slow as the year progresses.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",CME's BrokerTec to launch new collateral basket for EU bonds,"LONDON (Reuters) - Electronic bond trading platform BrokerTec will on Monday launch a collateral basket for bonds issued by the European Union, marking a further step in the EU's transformation into one of the world's biggest borrowers.
The 27-nation EU, which borrowed relatively small amounts before the coronavirus pandemic, has started issuing bonds that will raise up to 800 billion euros ($943 billion) in the coming years to aid its response to the crisis. The bloc has also issued bonds to fund the EU's SURE unemployment scheme.
Investors say the scale of the planned issuance means there is a need for infrastructure to support trading volumes - in particular by making the new debt easier to use as collateral for repo markets. 
BrokerTec's new general collateral basket for EU debt ""will include both SURE and Next Generation EU bonds,"" said Kate Karimson, head of European repo at the platform.
BrokerTec is part of the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), the world's biggest financial derivatives exchange.
""Our customers say this should help with liquidity,"" Karimson said, while stressing that it was still early days for the EU's development into a major bond market. 
Banks and businesses rely on repo markets to raise cash against collateral, often via high-quality sovereign bonds such as triple-A rated German debt.
Including EU bonds in a collateral basket could help ease pressure on the supply of German Bunds, a market squeezed by massive central bank bond-buying.
And repo market activity would allow the borrowing and lending of EU securities, in turn allowing for investors to take a position in cash bond markets. 
BrokerTec said it had been in talks with the European Commission about how to further support this new EU bond issuance across repo and cash bond trading.
The EU will establish a bills programme for short-dated borrowing and in September start selling debt at auction, where dealers purchase the debt and sell it onto investors, as government borrowers commonly do.
So far the EU has sold new bonds via a syndicate of banks. Selling bonds at auction, issuing bills and tapping existing bonds are all tools used by debt management agencies to build up liquidity in bond markets.
""Everyone is looking to see what happens here (EU bond issuance), everyone is of the same appetite to increase liquidity in this space,"" said BrokerTec's Karimson.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nordea Bank beat second-quarter profit expectations on Wednesday as a booming mortgage market and higher assets under management offset increased costs at the Nordic region's biggest lender.
Sweden's banks have all seen increased demand for wealth management and strong business activity, particularly in real estate and card payments, as the vaccine rollout blunted the coronavirus, paving the way back to normal operations.
""Restrictions are easing, vaccination programmes are progressing well, and a return to more normal activity is under way,"" CEO Frank Vang-Jensen said in a statement.
Second-quarter net profit rose to 1.03 billion euros ($1.21 billion) from 243 million a year ago, beating the mean forecast of 868.5 million expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
The bank reported a positive adjustment of 51 million euros on loans versus losses of 696 million a year earlier and analysts' expectations for losses of 81 million.
Shares in the lender were up 3% at 1008 GMT, just ahead of the European banking index which was up 2.4%.
Loan loss provisions have became a closely watched figure in the economic slump caused by the pandemic.
Nordea increased its cost guidance for 2021 to around 4.6 billion euros after previously saying it would be below 4.6 billion due to the acquisition of Nordea Finance Equipment and higher staff payouts due to a strong performance in the quarter.
Fee and commission income rose to 878 million euros from 673 million, beating the 823 million expected by analysts, as assets under management climbed to record levels and card payments increased.
Interest income, which includes income from mortgages, increased to 1.2 billion euros from 1.09 billion, in line with the 1.21 billion seen by analysts.
""Another really strong result,"" said Robin Rane, an analyst a Kepler Cheuvreux, noting the interest income, fees and the unexpected positive adjustment on loans.
Rane said he expected investors to reward Nordea despite a recent lack of appetite to buy shares in banks which had posted strong Q2 results. 
Vang-Jensen said Nordea was ready to distribute unpaid dividends for 2019 and 2020 totalling 0.72 euros per share once regulators allow shareholder payouts.
He also said the bank had applied to begin a process of share buy-backs.

Nordea shares are up 46% this year.

(Reuters) - A slew of upbeat updates from European blue-chip firms helped the region's benchmark index rise on Wednesday and further recover from Monday's sharp losses, while travel stocks roared back after weeks of declines. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.4%, extending Tuesday's small gains. Travel and leisure stocks jumped 4.2% after getting hammered recently by worries about a resurgence in virus cases.
Dutch semiconductor equipment maker rose 3.6% and neared all-time highs hit just last week after it raised its 2021 sales outlook and announced a new share buyback plan.
Shares in peers ASMI and BE Semiconductor rose about 3% each. 
Swiss drugmaker Novartis added 1.8% as its second-quarter core net income beat market expectations, boosted by its key drug brands.
European companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to post a 115.2% jump in second-quarter profit versus a year ago, as per Refinitiv IBES data. While forecast for profit growth has consistently risen, many expect growth rate to peak in the second quarter. 
However, the upbeat reports helped investors to look past worries about a cooling global growth as many parts of Asia, Europe and the United States grappled with surging cases of the Delta variant.
""The sharp rise in virus cases remains a real and present danger, particularly for those countries where vaccination levels are well below 50%,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""In the case of the likes of the U.K. and U.S. where vaccination levels are much higher, markets are banking that the vaccine wall holds back the virus enough not to overwhelm the respective healthcare systems of both countries."" 
Investors expect the European Central Bank to stick to a dovish tone at its policy meeting on Thursday. Earlier this month, it had unveiled a new strategy where it will tolerate higher inflation by targeting 2% inflation.
Among decliners, German business software group SAP slid 1.9% despite raising its outlook for the second time this year.

Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) fell slipped 0.9% after it warned that a global shortage of semiconductor chips will dent car sales in the second half of 2021.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Japan's Nidec books 60% quarterly profit rise helped by EV motor demand,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese electronic components maker Nidec Corp said on Wednesday its first-quarter operating profit jumped 60% to 44.6 billion yen ($406 million), helped by a rebound in demand for motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and home appliances.
Nidec, better known for producing electric motors for computer hard drives and smartphones, is trying to capture about a third of an emerging market for energy-saving EV motors known as e-axles. Demand for those is widely expected to increase 10 times over the next decade.
As it expands into auto parts, Nidec on Monday said it had agreed to consider a joint venture with Taiwan's Hon Hai Technology Group to develop EV motors. The companies said in a news release they would aim to establish the venture in 2022, helping Nidec expand into new markets and ensuring a stable supply of motors for Hon Hai.
In April, Nidec, which supplies e-axles to automakers including China's Guangzhou Automobile Co Ltd and France's Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), announced plans to invest 200 billion yen over a decade to build a production hub in Serbia that will manufacture motors for EVs and household appliances.
Nidec's earnings result for the three months to June 30, up from 28 billion yen a year earlier, was better than the 41.2 billion yen average of six analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Despite the rebound, a shortage of semiconductors had acted as a drag on sales and profits during the quarter by forcing its customers to cut production levels, Nidec president, Jun Seki, told a media briefing.
""We expect that output to recover during the second quarter,"" he said. 

The company stuck to its full-year forecast for operating profit of 180 billion yen. That is lower than the 193.5 billion yen average of 22 analyst estimates, Refinitiv data showed.

The two automakers will each acquire a 10% stake in the joint venture, on par with Isuzu Motors and Hino Motors, while Toyota will hold a 60% stake, they said.
""With Suzuki and Daihatsu joining the project and working together, we'll be able to expand our circle of cooperation to not only cover commercial vehicles but also mini vehicles,"" said Toyota President Akio Toyoda.
""With this expansion, I believe that we'll be able to take one step closer to a better mobility society,"" Toyoda said.
The move comes as Japanese automakers face growing competition from tech giants and other rivals making electric and driverless cars.

Toyota, Isuzu and Hino launched the Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation in April to bolster their competitive edge in connected, commercial vehicles.
Daihatsu's president Soichiro Okudaira said joining the pact and introducing connected, mini-commercial vehicles would allow data sharing, a major benefit for companies to provide better services to customers and improve logistics efficiency.

The company, which makes online slot machines and roulette games, has seen more customers turning to online games and the United States becoming a growth market as more states consider making online gambling legal to boost tax receipts. 
Evolution, which has more than 500 customers including 888 Casino and Betsson, bought Swedish rival NetEnt for $2.12 billion last year, handing it popular slot games such as Starburst and Piggy Riches.
Apart from buying companies, the company has also been launching new studios. Its studio in Michigan - the third in the United States - is approved and ready for launch, and the company plans to add two new delivery hubs in Europe this year.
However, the pandemic has slowed down its expansion plans.
""The overall situation is improving but it is still very hard and the pandemic is not over,"" CEO Martin Carlesund said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) -British fashion retailer Next lifted its profit forecast on Wednesday after pent-up demand for adult clothes and warm weather helped it smash sales forecasts for the last 11 weeks. 
The mainstay of Britain's shopping streets said full-price sales jumped 19% over the 11 weeks compared with the same period two years ago, before the disruptions of the pandemic, far above its forecast for 3%. 
The company said pretax profit for the year to January 2022 would be about 750 million pounds ($1 billion) under its central guidance, an increase of 30 million pounds. 
Shares in Next rose 10% in early trade, taking gains in the last 12 months to 60%.
It put the sales surge down to a combination of pent-up demand for adult clothes after 18 months of pandemic restrictions, warmer weather at the end of May and start of June, and an increase in spending as shoppers take fewer holidays abroad and dip into savings built up in lockdowns.
British retailers reported a record annual increase in sales in the three months to the end of June, the British Retail Consortium said earlier this month, with a 28.4% rise on a year earlier and 10.4% on two years ago.
Next, which runs the online Directory business alongside its stores, said it did not expect sales to remain at an exceptionally strong level, but it was optimistic about the second half, when it sees sales up 6% on levels two years ago.
The increase in profit guidance would have been higher had it not decided to repay 29 million pounds of business rates relief, accounting for the time its shops were open. It said it had taken the decision after consulting major shareholders.

Next forecast surplus cash for the year to be 240 million pounds, which it plans to give to shareholders via special dividends. It will pay the first - valued at 110 pence a share - in September.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, continuing to rebound after the weak start to the week with earnings season continuing in strong style.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.6%.
Global stock indices have stabilized after Monday’s sharp losses on fears the recent surge of Covid-19 cases will derail the global economic recovery. While the uncertainty caused by the increase of infections, caused mainly by the highly-transmissible delta variant, remains, investors have been buoyed by a mainly positive quarterly earnings season.
 Next  (LON:NXT) stock soared almost 9% after the British fashion retailer smashed its sales expectations, with a rise of 19% in sales in the last 11 weeks compared with two years ago, and raised its profit guidance.
Novartis (DE:NOVZn) stock rose 2% after the Swiss drugmaker beat expectations for its second-quarter profit while keeping its 2021 guidance.
There were also upward revisions to guidance from SAP (DE:SAPG), Europe's largest software company, while paints maker Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY) also beat forecasts but warned of enduring issues with raw material costs and availability.
BASF (DE:BASFN) stock gained 1% after the German company said it had been chosen to develop high-performing lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles with Cellforce Group, a joint venture between Porsche and Customcells.
On the flip side, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock fell 2.1% after the German auto giant said that the global semiconductor chip shortage will continue to affect its business in the second half of 2020 and that its third-quarter car sales will be the same or below the second quarter.
Additionally, the European Central Bank starts a two-day meeting on Wednesday, after raising its inflation goal to 2% earlier this month. President Christine Lagarde hinted at a change to the bank's guidance last week, reflecting the slightly higher tolerance for inflation in the new strategy. 
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher Wednesday after losses following a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, at a time when rising Covid-19 infections threaten the demand outlook.
U.S. crude stocks increased by 0.81 million barrels for the week ended July 15, the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday, which would be the first build since May, if confirmed by the Energy Information Administration later Wednesday. 
Crude prices have sold off sharply in recent days, after climbing to their highest levels since 2014 earlier this month, as Covid-19 cases spread into the U.S. and Europe from Asia.
At 4:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $67.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $69.87. Both contracts are around 8% lower this week to date.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 03:52AM ET</span>","Full Brexit checks risk becoming 'incendiary' in N.Ireland, M&S says","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -The introduction of full customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland risks becoming ""incendiary"" when prices rise and favourite products fail to get through, one of the country's biggest retailers said. 
Archie Norman, the chairman of Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), told BBC Radio that the planned introduction of full post-Brexit checks in October would be ""business destructive"" and prevent the food and clothing retailer from providing its full range.
Customs officials have so far applied a light-touch approach to checking goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain under a protocol system that was designed to keep open the province's border with EU member Ireland while stopping goods from entering the EU's single market unchecked across that frontier.
Norman said the retailer had already struggled to get goods into EU members Ireland and France since Britain left the European Union's single market at the beginning of the year, due to the huge amount of paperwork that was required.
He expects his stores in Northern Ireland to suffer a similar fate if the introduction of full checks goes ahead. 
""It risks being incendiary for the public in Northern Ireland because you can't think of a more visible demonstration of how you're no longer a full part of the United Kingdom than you can't get your favourite Christmas products, you can't buy M&S chicken, free range eggs, sandwiches,"" he said. 
""It's going to be very very serious for customers."" 
The introduction of the protocol, which was agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, has forced M&S to employ vets to tick boxes and fill out forms. Switching supply chains to increase production in Ireland would increase prices, he said.
In a letter to Britain's Brexit minister David Frost, Norman said M&S now completed 40,000 pages of customs documents per week to get goods into Ireland, and that will increase to 120,000 when the full rules for Northern Ireland start.
One error on a form can lead to an entire truck of 650 items being stopped, he said. M&S has cut 20% of its range in Ireland. 

""I really, really worry about the visibility of this because ... everyone in Northern Ireland is going to see, very very visibly, the impact of Brexit and the protocol because there will be gaps on the shelves,"" he said, adding that they had already delisted some products for Christmas.
Norman, who followed rivals Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda in warning about the situation, noted that Northern Ireland households already had less than half of the UK average of discretionary income, and that they now faced higher prices.

(Reuters) -Netflix Inc said it would make a deeper dive into video games as the movie and TV streaming service projected weak subscriber growth amid growing competition and the lifting of pandemic restrictions that had kept people at home. 
The company's shares hovered about even at $531.10 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is weathering a sharp slowdown in new customers after a boom in 2020 fueled by stay-at-home orders to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States and Canada, Netflix reported losing about 430,000 subscribers in the second quarter, only its third quarterly decline in 10 years. 
The streaming video pioneer said it was in the early stages of expanding its video game offerings, which would be available to subscribers at no extra charge. The company will initially focus primarily on mobile games. 
""We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. 
The multi-year effort will start ""relatively small"" with games tied to Netflix hits, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said in a post-earnings video interview. 
""We know that fans of those stories want to go deeper. They want to engage further,"" Peters said.
Netflix has dabbled in video games with a few titles linked to series including ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance."" 
Some analysts have said the company that dominates streaming video needs to find new ways to jump-start subscriptions after years of rapid expansion. According to eMarketer, Netflix's share of U.S. revenue from subscription streaming video will shrink to 30.8% by the end of 2021, from nearly 50% in 2018.
""Netflix delivered another underwhelming quarter as competition in the streaming space heats up,"" said Investing.com senior analyst Jesse Cohen. ""The absence of any new looming growth catalysts has been one of the main reasons for Netflix’s relatively mild performance this year.""
Co-CEO Reed Hastings said gaming and other ventures such as podcasts and merchandise sales will be ""supporting elements"" to help attract and retain customers to its core business of streaming video. 
The company projected it would add 3.5 million customers from July through September. Wall Street had expected a forecast of 5.5 million, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
For the just-ended quarter, Netflix added 1.54 million customers, beating analyst projections of 1.04 million. Total subscribers numbered 209 million at the end of June.
A year ago, Netflix picked up 10.1 million subscribers in the second quarter. 
This year, Netflix felt the impact of COVID-19 on TV production, which left the company with a small menu of new titles. At the same time, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max and other services attracted customers, and summer blockbusters returned to movie theaters.
The easing of pandemic safety measures also lured people out of their homes and away from their televisions.
Earnings for April through June came in at $2.97 per share, below the average forecast of $3.16. 
Netflix promises a heavier lineup in the second half of 2021, including new seasons of ""You,"" ""Money Heist"" and ""The Witcher."" 
If its subscriber forecast pans out, Netflix will have added more than 54 million subscribers over the past two years, a pace consistent with its annual additions before the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said.

It also noted that streaming television still accounts for a small portion of overall viewing time and that its service is less mature outside the United States.
""It's still an enormous prize and we are still in the best position to run after it,"" Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.

""Following a record-high net profit in the first half of the year, we are entering the second half from a position of strength,"" Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher said in a statement.
Wealth and asset managers have continued to benefit from soaring stock markets and continued client activity. 
Larger rival UBS on Tuesday posted a 63% jump in second-quarter net profit, easily beating expectations as buoyant markets continued to help the world's largest wealth manager generate higher earnings from managing money for the rich.

That momentum ramped up in the final two months of the half-year, raising the bank's managed assets by 12% from end-2020 to 486 billion Swiss francs and net new money to 10 billion francs for the six months through June.
Baer reported an adjusted cost/income ratio of 61.2%, higher than the 60% posted through April but still well ahead of the target it had previously set for 67% by 2022.

Additionally, the European Central Bank starts a two-day meeting on Wednesday, after raising its inflation goal to 2% earlier this month. President Christine Lagarde hinted at a change to the bank's guidance last week, reflecting the slightly higher tolerance for inflation in the new strategy. 
Elsewhere, oil prices continued to weaken Wednesday following a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, at a time when rising Covid-19 infections threaten the demand outlook.
U.S. crude stocks increased by 0.81 million barrels for the week ended July 15, the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday, which would be the first build since May, if confirmed by the Energy Information Administration later Wednesday. 
Crude prices have sold off sharply in recent days, after climbing to their highest levels since 2014 earlier this month, as Covid-19 cases spread into the U.S. and Europe from Asia.
At 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $66.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $69.01. Both contracts are around 8% lower this week to date.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,812.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1763.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak has raised $1.5 billion in its initial public offering, the country's largest issue, after pricing it at the top of an indicated price range, three sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The IPO by Indonesia's fourth-biggest e-commerce company, which is backed by Singapore sovereign investor GIC and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) among others, comes as Indonesia's $40 billion e-commerce market is benefiting from strong pandemic-driven demand.
Two of the sources said order books for the IPO, the first by an Indonesian tech unicorn, were multiple times covered, with one saying the issue received more than $6 billion of demand.
The sources asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to publicly talk about the matter.
Bukalapak declined to comment.
Until a few months ago, Bukalapak was looking to raise just $300 million. That grew to $800 million and then to $1.5 billion last week as investors clamoured for a piece of the company, Reuters reported previously.
Bukalapak has priced its IPO at the top of its 750 and 850 rupiah apiece indicated price, with the company valued at roughly $6 billion, the sources said. Bukalapak is set to make its market debut next month.

Bukalapak focuses on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as it competes with bigger rivals Tokopedia, Sea Ltd's Shopee and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Lazada, in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and UBS are the joint global coordinators and bookrunners with Mandiri.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with U.S. counterparts recording their biggest advance since March 2021. Brightening investor sentiment, as concerns about rising numbers of global COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant were somewhat eased, gave global shares a boost.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.51% by 10:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT). Trade data released earlier in the day was better than expected, with exports growing 48.6% year-on-year, a fourth consecutive month of double-digit gains and imports growing 32.7% year-on-year in June.
The Bank of Japan also released the minutes from its latest policy meeting.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.33%. The country’s producer price index rose a lower-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month and 6.4% year-on-year in June.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.97%, with the latest retail sales figures released earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.63%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.48% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.02%.
A rally in U.S. Treasuries pressed the pause button to send benchmark 10-year yields back above the 1.2% mark.
Rising COVID-19 case numbers, and the resultant restrictive measures implemented by some countries, sent global shares on a downward trend earlier in the week over concerns about the economic impact. However, loose U.S. monetary policy, still-high levels of economic expansion and robust corporate earnings brightened investor sentiment and led retail investors to buy dips in equities.
“We had a dip, we had a shock, there is fear of the Delta variant and there is the other side, which is some day we get beyond COVID-19 and when we do, we have a worldwide recovery,” Cumberland Advisors Inc. chief investment officer David Kotok told Bloomberg.
“We are seeing that tension going on in the markets for the last few days,” he added.
Other investors sounded a more cautious note.
“From a long-term perspective we are really still very constructive on equity markets, so we’d encourage clients to be overweight risk assets... the correction we had is healthy to clear some of the excess out of the market and to get better balancing between growth and value,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management’s co-head of fundamental equity Katie Koch told Bloomberg.
Investors now await the European Central Bank and Bank Indonesia policy decisions, both due to be handed down on Thursday.
Across the Atlantic, U.S. data released on Tuesday showed building permits were at an eight-month low of 1.598 million units, while housing starts were at a better-than-expected 1.643 million units, in June. Existing home sales figures for June are due on Thursday.
Meanwhile, talks continue over the U.S.’s gigantic $579 billion infrastructure spending package forming a key part of President Joe Biden’s plan to revive the economy.
On a separate note, the Biden administration said it is starting to see signs that the global semiconductor supply shortage is coming to an end."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a tougher look at defense industry mergers, questioning a proposal from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) that would allow it to buy the biggest independent maker of rocket motors, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD). 
The Democratic senator, who has a keen interest in corporate behavior, asked the FTC to examine the premise and efficacy of internal firewalls like those Lockheed proposes to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over peers once the deal closes, according to a July 16 letter seen by Reuters.
Lockheed Martin announced a $4.4 billion agreement to buy Aerojet late last year, a deal that has raised eyebrows because it would give Lockheed - the No. 1 defense contractor - ownership of a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry whose motors are used in everything from the homeland missile shield to Stinger missiles.
Lockheed has said after the deal closes ""the Aerojet Rocketdyne business will continue to serve as a merchant supplier"" to the entire defense industry, a premise that was met with skepticism by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), a major customer for rocket motors.
Internal firewalls would be needed at the new company to protect competitor intellectual property, pricing and product progress in the highly competitive weapons business. 
Warren's letter urged the FTC to take a stronger antitrust stance on defense deals and said the Lockheed tie-up should not be allowed until the FTC understood the effectiveness of past internal firewalls, which she views as necessary to maintain competition, as well as national security.
In a statement, Lockheed said the company ""has a long history of successfully and ethically operating as a merchant supplier to the entire industry,"" adding it has operated with ""effective and trusted firewalls"" in the past. 
A firewall is an example of a ""behavioral remedy,"" one of the tools the FTC has to preserve competition. That is why Warren's letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan asked if ""behavioral remedies"" have protected competition and prevented monopolistic behavior in the defense industry.
Behavioral remedies usually expire after a few years. 
A ""structural remedy,"" a more common enforcement mechanism, generally requires a company to sell a line of business to prevent monopolistic behavior.

In February, the FTC extended its review of the deal under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to scrutinize potentially anti-competitive mergers.
Lockheed said it expected the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year.

Canada on Monday said it would allow fully vaccinated U.S. tourists to enter the country starting from Aug. 9, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented 16-month ban. 
A rapid return in traffic can create staffing headaches for carriers which cancelled thousands of flights during the COVID-19 pandemic when demand plummeted.
Some U.S. airlines scrambled to re-train pilots whose flying credentials expired during the pandemic as the carriers raced to meet a surge in summer travel demand. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), for example, trimmed its July flying due to overall labor shortages.
Air Canada has 600, or around 15% of an estimated 4,000 pilots on furlough, according to the Air Canada Pilots Association.
Montreal-based Air Canada said by email the carrier took steps during the pandemic to keep pilots in the air, such as by having three pilots instead of two on some flights.
""We have all the fully qualified pilots we require as travel ramps back up,"" an Air Canada spokesperson said.
Air Canada has 11 simulators and access to five more through aviation training specialist CAE (NYSE:CAE).
Montreal-based CAE has seen higher demand for its simulator services, with its pilot-training centers now operating at around 60% of capacity in the United States, a spokeswoman said.
Air Canada shares closed up 6.48%. The carrier reports quarterly earnings on Friday.
Air Canada's smaller rival WestJet Airlines said it continues to recall professionals, ""who in many cases have been furloughed for many months."" 

WestJet also said it is not actively ""pursuing financial support"" from the Canadian government, despite holding earlier talks. 
Air Canada (AC.TO) reached a deal in April for a government aid package.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 09:06PM ET</span>","In push to supply Tesla, Piedmont Lithium irks North Carolina neighbors","By Ernest Scheyder
GASTON COUNTY, N.C. (Reuters) -In its quest to build one of the largest lithium mines in the United States, Piedmont Lithium Inc has overlooked one crucial constituency: its North Carolina neighbors.
Piedmont last autumn signed a deal to supply U.S. electric automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc with lithium sourced from its deposits in North Carolina, sending the company's stock up tenfold.
Piedmont has also hired investment banks to find investors for its $840 million project, which would include an open-air pit more than 500 feet (152 m) deep and facilities to produce lithium-based electric vehicle (EV) battery chemicals.
The company, however, has not applied for a state mining permit or a necessary zoning variance in Gaston County, just west of Charlotte, despite telling investors since 2018 that it was on the verge of doing so.
Five of the seven members of the county's board of commissioners, who control zoning changes, say they may block or delay the project because Piedmont has not told them what levels of dust, noise and vibrations will occur, nor how water and air quality would be affected.
Shares of the company fell as much as 21% on Tuesday after the Reuters story.
""Piedmont has sort of put the proverbial cart before the horse,"" said Tom Keigher, chair of the board of commissioners. ""Why in the world would they make this deal with Tesla before they even have approval for the mine?""
Piedmont said it waited to approach officials in order to refine its plans - it published a third iteration last month - and to secure a customer to show that the mine could stay open for its projected 20-year lifespan.
""We finally have a project to debut and really talk about,"" said Keith Phillips, Piedmont's chief executive officer.
""Maybe it would have been better had (commissioners) been in the loop constantly. We didn't really have the time or resources to do it and we didn't even know what to tell them, until now.""
The deteriorating relationship between Piedmont and county leaders reflects broader tension in the United States as resistance to living near a mine clashes with the potential of EVs to mitigate climate change.
Piedmont has already spent $58 million on the project, which would produce about 30,000 tonnes of lithium annually, enough to make about 3 million EVs.
The company originally planned to put its chemical plant in a neighboring county, but now intends to build it near the mine, a step that should reduce truck traffic. Piedmont also plans to crush rock in the mine pit, alleviating dust, and incorporate solar power.
The stock price closed Tuesday at $50.52, down 19.9%. 
TUESDAY MEETING
In September 2018, Piedmont told investors it expected to obtain permits by the end of 2019. In August 2019, executives said they would apply for permits and rezoning ""in the coming months.""
Piedmont said both times it was ""not aware"" of any reason why the county would not approve zoning changes, even though it had yet to present any information to commissioners. In December, Piedmont said it expected to receive local zoning approval before the end of June.
The company said the delays were due in part to weak lithium prices in recent years.
Piedmont had been set to meet with commissioners in March, but canceled with three days' notice, further straining the relationship. Piedmont said it canceled that meeting in order to further refine its plans.
""This has been the worst rollout of a project from a company I've ever seen,"" said Chad Brown, a commissioner who opposes the mine.
Phillips, Piedmont's CEO, gave the company's first presentation on the proposed project to commissioners on Tuesday night, though no vote was held. 
""We haven't done a good job - and I blame myself - engaging with the community,"" Phillips said at the nearly three-hour-long meeting, which was webcast. One commissioner told Phillips it likely will be easier for the company to raise the necessary $840 million for the project than it will be to secure community support.
Phillips said Piedmont expects to apply for a state mining permit this summer, begin construction in April 2022 and be in production by the second half of 2023. 
Eighteen county residents told the board they opposed the project. One spoke for it.
""Good county commissioners don't let strangers intrude into our community knowing they're going to bring destruction,"" Libby Carpenter, 80, told the board.
Piedmont's deal with Tesla involves supplying roughly 53,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate to the automaker's planned lithium hydroxide chemical plant in Texas starting sometime between July 2022 and July 2023.
Piedmont declined to discuss the Tesla arrangement, but hinted the automaker may not need supply by 2023.
""We're confident in the relationship we have with our customer to be able to manage the supply of lithium when they need it,"" said David Klanecky, Piedmont's chief operating officer.
Tesla, which has other lithium suppliers, did not respond to requests for comment.
The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which issues mining permits, said it expects an application ""in the near future.""
State officials added their review process could stretch for more than a year as they solicit comments from at least six other state and federal agencies.
""I'm not even going to accept an application from Piedmont for rezoning until they have their state permit in hand,"" said Brian Sciba, director of Gaston County's planning and zoning office.
'MINE AROUND MY PROPERTY'
Piedmont, whose stock trades in Australia and began trading on the Nasdaq in the United States earlier this year, owns or controls more than 3,000 acres (12 sq km) in the western corner of rural Gaston County.
While some landowners are prepared to sell if the offer is enticing enough, others say Piedmont has bullied them.
""They told me that if I don't sell, they'll just mine around my property,"" said Emilie Nelson, whose 14 acres Piedmont has tried to buy since 2017.
Piedmont said it was unaware if one of its contractors made the alleged threat, but did not authorize or condone it.
""We always deal respectfully with folks,"" said Patrick Brindle, Piedmont's vice president of project management. ""And if we weren't those kind of operators, I don't think we would be successful in entering into the number of agreements with landowners that we have.""
Landowners said they would prefer Piedmont only build a processing plant and rely on a foreign mine for lithium supply. Livent (NYSE:LTHM) Corp and  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp operate lithium processing plants in the county that source the metal from South America.
Piedmont, which recently bought stakes in Quebec and Ghana lithium projects, said it prefers to mine and process the metal at the Gaston County site.

Piedmont's arrangement with Tesla has done little to impress locals. More than 1,500 have signed a petition asking officials to block the mine.
""There's no doubt the mine would benefit our country and the green energy industry,"" said Tracy Philbeck, a commissioner. ""But it would have a negative impact on our community.""

(Reuters) - Shares in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) closed up 24.5% on Tuesday after a late session volume spike boosted the cinema operator which has been a big focus on social media.
AMC shares ended the session at $43.09 after rising as high as $44.39. With trading volume around 166 million shares it was the second most actively traded on stock on U.S. exchanges on the day.
While the volatile stock was up sharply throughout the trading day it picked up more steam during the last hour of trading when it surpassed $40 for the first time since July 13. 
Possibly helping the shares on Tuesday was AMC's announcement late Monday that it was planning to start operating cinemas in two high-grossing locations in Los Angeles, starting in August and that it was in in active discussions with other property owners regarding use of currently closed locations.
Also AMC's shares have been boosted this year by their popularity among retail investors using social media forums such as Twitter and Reddit to encourage each other to buy the stock. Along with video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC has been at the center of massive rallies in January as retail investors looked to hurt bearish hedge funds betting against the stocks.
The stock has lost ground recently after hitting a record high of $72.62 in early June, but it is still up about 1,933% so far for 2021. 

About 75.84 million shares of AMC were sold short as of Monday's close, representing about 15 percent of its float, a decline of 4 million shares over the last week, according to the latest data from S3 Partners. 
For its second quarter ended in June AMC is expected to report a quarterly loss per share of $0.93 on revenue of $369.93, according to analyst estimates gathered by Refinitiv. AMC has not announced a release date for its Q2 results.

""The economically sensitive stocks are up today,"" Carlson added. ""When the 10-year (Treasury yield) goes down in a short period of time, that typically doesn’t happen with an economy that’s supposed to be growing. Firming in the 10-year (yield) indicates that perhaps the economy isn’t going to be falling off a cliff.""

By Brendan Pierson and Nate Raymond
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The three largest U.S. drug distributors agreed mid-trial to pay up to $1.18 billion to settle claims by New York state and two of its biggest counties over their role in the nationwide opioid epidemic, the state's attorney general said on Tuesday.
McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp settled as state attorneys general prepare to announce as soon as this week a landmark $26 billion deal with the distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) resolving cases nationwide.
The deal with New York Attorney General Letitia James and the populous Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk came three weeks into the first jury trial accusing companies of profiting from a flood of addictive painkillers that devastated communities.
""While no amount of money will ever compensate for the millions of addictions, the hundreds of thousands of deaths, or the countless communities decimated by opioids, this money will be vital in preventing any future devastation,"" James said. 
Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer for Nassau County at the law firm Napoli Shkolnik, said in a statement that unlike the proposed national settlement, the New York deal ""is not contingent on the rest of the country or other states joining.""
In a joint statement, the distributors called the settlement ""an important step toward finalizing a broad settlement with states, counties, and political subdivisions.""
'GETTING CLOSE' ON NATIONAL SETTLEMENT 
The national settlement is expected to be announced later this week, people familiar with the matter said. Joe Rice, a lead negotiator for lawyers for the cities and counties at Motley Rice, told reporters the parties are ""getting close"" to finalizing a deal.
State attorneys general from 10 states including Tennessee, Texas, Pennsylvania and North Carolina in a joint statement on Tuesday said their ""negotiations are progressing well and potentially nearing their completion.""
After the framework is announced, states and their subdivisions will need to decide whether to join the global accord, the sources have said. The ultimate settlement price-tag could fluctuate depending on how many agree to the deal or reject it to pursue litigation on their own.
The settlement also calls the creation of a national clearinghouse of data on opioid shipments operated under the oversight of an independent third-party monitor.
Paul Geller, a lead negotiator for the plaintiffs at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said that provision would be ""transformative"" in battling drug oversupply.
Nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC last week said provisional data showed that 2020 was a record year for overall drug overdose deaths with 93,331, up 29% from a year earlier.
REMAINING DEFENDANTS
More than 3,300 cases have been filed largely by states and local governments alleging drugmakers falsely marketed opioid painkillers as safe, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being diverted to illegal channels.
The New York trial will continue against three drugmakers accused of deceptively marketing their painkillers - Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit.
Ahead of the trial, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $263 million to resolve the claims by the state and counties. Pharmacy operators Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc agreed to settle with the counties for a combined $26 million.
Two other opioid cases are also on trial in West Virginia and California. The companies have denied wrongdoing.

James' office said that of the nearly $1.18 billion the distributors agreed to pay, more than $1 billion will go toward addressing the epidemic. The counties have said the money will be used for mental health and addiction programs.
Payments will start in two months and will continue over the next 17 years, James said.

""Best day ever,"" Bezos, accompanied by three crewmates including the world's oldest and youngest space travelers, said after his capsule descended with three large parachutes and touched down, kicking up a cloud of dust.
The 57-year-old American billionaire, donning a blue flight suit and cowboy hat, took a trip to the edge of space lasting 10 minutes and 10 seconds. After landing, Bezos and his crewmates exchanged hugs and popped champagne while roughly two dozen family members and company employees cheered.

""I want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all of this,"" Bezos told reporters afterward.
The flight came nine days after Briton Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism venture Virgin Galactic's successful inaugural suborbital flight https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 from New Mexico. The two flights give credibility and inject enthusiasm into the fledgling commercial space tourism industry, which Swiss bank UBS estimates will be worth $3 billion annually in a decade. 
Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000, said this first crewed space flight was a step toward developing a fleet of reusable spacecraft.
""We're going to build a road to space so that our kids and their kids can build a future,"" Bezos added. ""... We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth.""
Blue Origin plans for two more New Shepard passenger flights this year. Bezos said Blue Origin has not determined its pace of flights after that but is approaching $100 million in private sales.
""The demand is very, very high,"" Bezos said, adding: ""Big things start small.""
Bezos said his company is working ""ferociously"" toward being able to reuse New Shepard vehicles at least 100 times. The one used on Tuesday, twice previously flown to space, scored a bulls-eye landing on a nearby pad.
BACK FLIPS AND SKITTLES
New Shepard hurtled at speeds reaching 2,233 miles (3,595 km) per hour, exceeding the ""Kármán line"" - 62 miles (100 km) - set by an international aeronautics body to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. 
After the capsule separated from the booster, the crew unbuckled, performing back flips and tossing each other Skittles candy in weightlessness. The capsule then returned to Earth with parachutes, using a retro-thrust system expelling a ""pillow of air"" for a soft landing.
The launch represented another step in the fierce competition to forge a space tourism sector. In this ""billionaire space race,"" Branson pierced Earth's atmosphere first, reaching an altitude of 53 miles (86 km) aboard his rocket-powered, pilot-flown spaceplane. Bezos flew higher in what experts called the world's first https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/first-human-flight-updates unpiloted space flight with an all-civilian crew. 
Another billionaire tech mogul, Elon Musk, plans to send an all-civilian crew on a several-day orbital mission on his Crew Dragon capsule in September.
""Well done,"" Branson wrote on Twitter, congratulating Bezos and his crewmates.
Musk earlier wished https:// Blue Origin's crew ""best of luck.""
The flight came on the 52nd anniversary of Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin becoming the first humans to walk on the moon. New Shepard's namesake Alan Shepard in 1961 became the first American in space. 
Funk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become NASA astronauts in the 1960s but was passed over because of her gender. 
""I've been waiting a long time,"" Funk said afterward. ""I want to go again - fast.""

Daemen, Blue Origin's first paying customer, is set to study physics and innovation management at college in the Netherlands. His investment executive father embraced him after he emerged from the capsule.
""The most profound piece of it for me was looking out at the Earth and looking at the Earth's atmosphere,"" Bezos said, noting how the experience underscored the planet's beauty and fragility.

Fox News commentators Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, as well as other news program hosts, have often cast doubt on the vaccines' safety and efficacy to the network's millions of viewers. The network ended January with a 19-year streak as the top U.S. cable news network.
Noting health official guidelines that encouraged masking and distancing even for vaccinated people in April, Carlson said of the vaccine: ""So maybe it doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that."" 
Ingraham on Monday night called Biden and his allies ""consistent superspreaders of misinformation on COVID."" 
The White House understands ""the importance of reaching Fox's audience about the COVID-19 vaccines and their benefits,"" Psaki told reporters Tuesday. ""And like we are with all of you here today, we of course, are in regular contact."" 
The White House has also engaged more broadly with the network on their coverage of COVID-19 and vaccine confidence, including with a network-specific briefing between producers and White House officials to discuss accurate, informed coverage of the COVID-19 vaccines, according to White House source familiar with the details.
Psaki was responding to a question from a CNN reporter who asked if there were high-level conversations between the White House and the news network over vaccine coverage.

In an emailed comment, a Fox News spokeswoman said: ""There have been no high level conversations between FOX News Media and the White House regarding our coverage.""
The spokeswoman said they had a routine briefing in May on vaccination rates and Fox News White House reporters are in routine contact with the White House staff on a variety of issues.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street notched a comeback on Tuesday with all the major indexes closing higher, and yields on safe-haven U.S. Treasuries bouncing off lows as investors sought riskier assets even as worries remained about a resurgence in COVID-19.
Wall Street's main indexes all rose by more than 1.5%, with the Dow ahead of the others. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries came off a new five-month low.
""Today's move was basically due to an over-correction from yesterday. Yesterday, it was an overreaction to an inflation scare, and the virus,"" said Catherine Avery, president of Catherine Avery Investment Management. ""I think people are realizing that as earnings are coming out more and more, that stocks are the place to be.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 549.95 points, or 1.62%, to close at 34,511.99, the S&P 500 gained 64.57 points, or 1.52%, to end Tuesday at 4,323.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 223.89 points, or 1.57%, to wind down the day at 14,498.88.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but consumer staples .SPLRCS closed up. Industrials rose the most, climbing 2.7%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.83%.
Ten-year Treasury yields rose 2.9 basis points to 1.210%, after tumbling to 1.128% earlier in the session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note has plunged almost 30 basis points in a week after investors were convinced that data for June showed the biggest jump in U.S. consumer prices in 13 years was short-lived.
""The bond market has valid concerns. But, even with the moderated outlook, it still leaves a lot of room for equities,"" said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""The bond market isn't calling for a recession, but perhaps a tamping down of growth expectations.""
In a separate gauge of investor risk appetite, bitcoin fell below $30,000 for the first time since June 22.
""The narrative from yesterday that bled through the weekend was a little bit of a risk-off scenario around the increasing COVID cases,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management. ""I don't think it's so much that investors are worried about the cases themselves. It's government officials and their reaction, where we could get into a situation where restrictive measures get put in place again, that dampens growth over the long run."" 
Riskier assets globally have come under pressure recently as many countries struggle to contain the outbreak of the fast-spreading Delta virus variant, raising fears that further lockdowns and other restrictions could upend the worldwide economic recovery. 
A fully vaccinated senior aide to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi tested positive for COVID-19, Pelosi aide Drew Hammill said on Tuesday.
The Delta variant is the cause of more than 80% of the new COVID-19 cases in the United States, but the authorized vaccines in the country are still more than 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said during a U.S. Senate hearing.
The U.S. dollar rose to a three-month peak on Tuesday as investors continued to flee to safety. 
The gains in the dollar come as yield differentials have moved against it.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines reported its sixth consecutive quarterly loss on Tuesday due to the coronavirus pandemic, though revenue quadrupled from a year ago and topped estimates with a strong domestic travel rebound.
U.S. leisure travel has nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels as more people fly for vacation or to visit friends and family following a massive nationwide vaccination campaign.
Chicago-based United said it will continue ramping up flying in the third quarter and forecast its total unit revenue - comparing sales to flight capacity - for the period will be higher than the same quarter in 2019, a turning point for the airline. 
The company said business and long-haul international travel, to which it is more exposed than rivals, accelerated faster than anticipated, and it expects a full recovery in demand by 2023.
United's adjusted net loss narrowed to $1.26 billion, or $3.91 per share, in the quarter, from $2.6 billion, or $9.31 per share, a year ago. Analysts had estimated a loss of $3.94, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding items, the company lost $434 million in the second quarter. United has said it expects to be profitable in the third and fourth quarter.
United's second-quarter adjusted operating revenue rose to $5.47 billion from about $1.47 billion a year ago, above analysts' average estimate of $5.35 billion. 
U.S. airlines have played down concerns over the impact of a resurgence in COVID-19, spurred by the more contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has become dominant in the United States and many other nations.
United's quarterly revenue was just half of the roughly $10 billion it booked in the same quarter of 2019 before the pandemic jolted the travel industry.
Its shares slipped 0.5% to $46.08 in extended trading after the U.S. airline index had its largest daily percentage gain on Tuesday since November.
As demand returns, U.S. airlines - which benefited from $54 billion in federal COVID-19 aid for workers' salaries - have rushed to restore their operations.
United last month unveiled its largest-ever aircraft order for 270 jets in a push to boost its domestic capacity by almost 30% and better compete for both premium and low-cost travel.
It has also announced a string of investments related to sustainability and innovation as airlines face renewed scrutiny over their environmental impact.

Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) last week reported a quarterly profit. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are due to report on Thursday.
United will discuss the results with analysts and investors on Wednesday.

Investing.com - United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) reported Tuesday second quarter earnings  that beat analysts' expectations, and said it expected to report profitability in the third quarter.
United Airlines Holdings shares lost 1.3% in after-hours trade following the report.
United Airlines Holdings announced a loss per share of $3.91 on revenue of $5.47 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss of $4.21 a share on revenue of $5.25 billion.
Reported second quarter 2021 total revenue per available seat mile fell 11.3% compared to second quarter 2019, with capacity down 46%.
Looking ahead, the company said it expects third quarter 2021 adjusted pre-tax income to be positive. That would mark the first quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income since the fourth quarter 2019.
Third quarter 2021 capacity is expected to be down around 26% compared to third quarter 2019, up 39% quarter over quarter. Cost per available seat mile for Q3, excluding fuel, profit sharing, third-party business expenses, and special charges is forecast to be up approximately 17% compared to third quarter 2019.

This may be even more the case if one targets such stocks from the booming technology industry. Thus, we believe dividend-paying mega technology players Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)—which are currently trading at valuations that are lower than their recent highs—are good picks now. Let's discuss.Because the stock market is expected to remain in a correction mode, or at least volatile, in the near term due to investors’ concerns about the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and high inflation, investing in dividend-paying stocks could help investors ensure a steady income stream. However, not every dividend-paying stock is necessarily a good bet now.
Because the prospects of the technology industry look promising thanks to the continuing global, digital transformation across industries and rising demand for advanced technologies, the chances that mega players in the industry will stay afloat amid the market volatility are very high. So, it could be wise to invest now on the price dips in dividend-paying mega tech stocks Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems, Inc.

(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s stock dropped 2% in a volatile session on Tuesday, with the COVID-19 vaccine maker the most heavily traded company on Wall Street ahead of its debut in the S&P 500 on Wednesday.
Over $34 billion worth of the company's shares were exchanged, 17 times more than Moderna's $2 billion average over the past six months, according to Refinitiv data. About $10 billion worth of those trades happened in the final seconds of the session.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was second-busiest stock, with about $14 billion worth of its shares traded.
After the bell, Moderna dropped an additional 1%, also in heavy volume.
Moderna joins the S&P 500 as of the start of trading on Wednesday. That means index funds managing over $5 trillion will have to have bought about 17% of the company's stock, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Moderna's inclusion in the index also means that actively managed funds that measure their performance against the S&P 500 are more likely to consider buying its shares.
During Tuesday's session, Moderna surged as much as 9% and fell as much as 7%. The stock has gained about 18% since July 15, when S&P Dow Jones Indices announced its addition to the S&P 500.

The latest volatility in Moderna's stock comes as concerns increase over the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, now responsible for the majority of new infections. Fears about a resurgence in the virus slammed Wall Street on Monday. 
Fueled by the success of its COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna's stock has rallied almost 200% so far in 2021.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 04:07PM ET</span>",Israel PM warns Unilever boss over Ben & Jerry's boycott,"By Dan Williams and Siddharth Cavale
JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel warned consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc on Tuesday of ""severe consequences"" from a decision by subsidiary Ben & Jerry's to stop selling ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, and urged U.S. states to invoke anti-boycott laws.
Monday's announcement followed pro-Palestinian pressure on the Vermont-based company over its business in Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, handled since 1987 through a licensee partner, Ben & Jerry's Israel.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements on Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
The country's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, in a phone call with Unilever CEO Alan Jope, called the move a ""glaring anti-Israel measure"" and said that the government would move ""aggressively against any boycott measure targeting civilians,"" according to the premier's office. 
Ben & Jerry's decision was also met with a swift response from some smaller grocery chains operating in the New York metro area, which has a large population of Jewish residents, saying they would either reduce or remove Ben & Jerry's products from shelves. 
Ben & Jerry's, based in South Burlington, Vermont, is known for its commitment to social justice that has recently included strongly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, LGBTQ+ rights and electoral campaign finance reform. 
It was acquired by Unilever in 2000 in a deal that allows it to operate with more autonomy than other subsidiaries, including giving legal powers to an independent board to make decisions over its social mission, brand integrity and policies.
On Monday, the Chunky Monkey ice-cream maker released a statement saying the brand would not renew its license agreement with its Israeli partner when it expires at the end of 2022. 
Ben & Jerry's said selling its products in the occupied Palestinian territories was ""inconsistent with its values"".
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price declined to respond to Ben & Jerry's decision, calling it ""the actions of a private company."" But he reiterated the Biden administration's opposition to the global boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement that seeks to isolate Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.
""We firmly reject the BDS movement, which unfairly singles out Israel,"" Price told a regular press briefing.
The episode has sparked a clash between Ben & Jerry's independent board and Unilever.

Ben & Jerry's Monday announcement went on to say that the company would stay in Israel under a different arrangement, without sales in the West Bank, among areas where Palestinians seek statehood. That position was reiterated in a separate statement issued by Unilever itself the same day.
In an interview https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ben-jerry-s-withdraws-sales-israeli-settlements-clashes-parent-company-n1274403 with NBC, Anuradha Mittal, the chair of Ben & Jerry's independent board, said the board had not been asked to vote on any proposal to continue sales in Israel, and so the announcement of the move had violated the acquisition deal of 2000.
The Ben & Jerry's board would have to vote to approve any different arrangement, which it had not done yet, Mittal said. 
""I am saddened by the deceit of it,"" Mittal told NBC. 
""This is not about Israel. It is about the violation of the acquisition agreement that maintained the soul of the company. I can't stop thinking that this is what happens when you have a board with all women and people of color who have been pushing to do the right thing.""
Asked for comment on Mittal's remarks, Unilever said: ""As you saw in our statement, Unilever has always recognised the right of the brand and its independent Board to take decisions about its social mission.
In New York, supermarket chain Morton Williams, which operates 15 stores in New York and one in New Jersey, said it is dramatically reducing Ben & Jerry's products at its stores, with its co-owner Avi Kaner adding it is contacting other retailers and distributors in the hope that they would follow suit.

Other supermarkets including Gourmet Glatt and New Jersey-based Cedar Market, released statements on Instagram saying they will no longer be carrying the brand, effective immediately. Florida-based Grove Kosher Market said none of their stores carry the brand and will not in the future as well.
Unilever shares closed down about a percent on Tuesday. The company reports first-half results on Thursday.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rebounded Tuesday, as investors took advantage beaten down travel-related stocks and financials following a rout the previous day.   
The S&P 500 rose 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, or 550 points, the Nasdaq was up 1.6%.
The United States 10-Year yield  rose above 1.2% after dropping to 1.14% earlier in the session, providing a much needed boost to financials, mostly bank stocks following Monday's selloff.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose more than 1%. 
The selloff on Monday was largely attributed to fears that a resurgence in Covid-19 infections would stall the recovery. The delta variant is now estimated to make up 83% of all Covid-19 cases in the U.S., the director of the CDC said Tuesday.
Some on Wall Street suggest the economy has transitioned from a recovery stage to an expansion phase. 
""The most visible signs of the transition have been the return of inflation-adjusted output in June to pre-pandemic levels; productivity-enhancing investment in high-tech equipment; broadening loan growth beyond consumers to businesses; and strong job gains as businesses gained renewed confidence,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Industrials were one of the biggest sector gainers, led by surge airline stocks including Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), with the latter up 8%. 
Energy also recovered some of its losses from a day earlier, up more than 1% amid a tentative rebound in oil prices as the delta wave threatens demand.
""Our bottom-up estimate of the impact that a Delta wave could have on global demand instead points to a potential 1 million-barrel-a-day hit for only a couple months, and even less if vaccines prove effect at lowering hospitalizations in DMs, the origin of most summer demand improvements,"" Goldman Sachs said.
Energy was given an added boost from a 3% surge in Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as the oil services company reported results that topped market expectations.
Technology stocks also benefited from dip-buying, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the ascendency, up more than 2%
UBS lifted its price target on Apple to $166 from $155, after raising estimates on tech giant's revenue and EPS for the third quarter to $74.7 billion and $1.01 from $71.3 billion and 95 cents, respectively.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were higher.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) rose 2% after its second-quarter results topped analysts estimates.
""We’re encouraged by momentum around our wider hybrid cloud thesis,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note as it raised its price target on  IBM  to $167 from $165.
On the economic front, June housing starts rose 6.3% to 1.64 million, above the consensus. ""Housing starts bounced unexpectedly in June [...] but starts appear to be capped at this level, given labor and material shortages,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said."

Investing.com - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) delivered softer third-quarter guidance Tuesday and second quarter earnings  that missed analysts' estimates amid slowing subscriber growth.      
Netflix announced earnings per share of $2.97 on revenue of $7.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $3.18 on revenue of $7.32 billion.
Netflix added 1.54 million users, above its forecast of 1 million net adds for the June quarter. Analysts had expected about 1.75 million net adds. 
The slowing of subscriber growth in its core entertainment streaming business has prompted the company to diversify into video games.  
""We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, the streaming giant expects to add 3.5 million net subscriber adds, well short of analysts estimates of 5.5 million. 
""COVID-related production delays in 2020 have led to a lighter first half of 2021 slate that will build through the course of the year. In the first six months of 2021, content amortization grew only 9% year over year (as compared to 17% in FY20). COVID and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largely running smoothly so far, we’re optimistic in our ability to deliver a strong second half slate,"" the company said in a letter to investors.

Investing.com -- Stocks roared back as investors took advantage of Monday’s sharp selloff to buy the dip despite ongoing concerns about the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
Monday’s slump in the three major indexes could be traced to the resurgence in Covid-19 infections  and worries it would stall the recovery. But others on Wall Street said the economy has already pivoted to an expansion phase.
Energy also recovered some of its losses from a day earlier, up more than 2% amid a tentative rebound in oil prices to just under $70 a barrel. Oil inventory data due out later Tuesday from the industry and Wednesday morning from the government could put a floor under prices if they show a continued draw down.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) rose 2% after its second-quarter results topped analysts estimates, kicking off the flurry of big tech earnings reports expected out in the next few days.
Aside from earnings, it’s a fairly quiet summer week on the data front. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Oil inventory
The American Petroleum Institute’s figures serve as a precursor to the official weekly inventory data due on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration. According to a consensus of analysts tracked by Investing.com, U.S. crude inventory likely fell by 4.47 million barrels last week, versus the previous week’s drop of 7.90 million. The API data are released at 4:30 PM ET and the EIA data are released at 10:30 AM ET.
2. Soft drink earnings
 Coca-Cola Co  (NYSE:KO) reports Wednesday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com see it likely to report earnings per share of 56 cents on revenue of $9.3 billion for the second quarter.
3. Telecom earnings
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), also due out on Wednesday before the opening bell, is seen reporting a second-quarter revenue of $32.71 billion and earnings per share of $1.30. Last week, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said it signed its largest-ever deal with Verizon, an $8.3 billion agreement to provide 5G solutions.

(Reuters) -Oilfield company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co on Tuesday topped Wall Street earnings estimates and offered an upbeat view for energy services demand as the downturn in oil drilling activity recedes.
The Houston, Texas-based company kicked off results for the oilfield services with a 33% jump in second-quarter profit from the previous three months.
Crude oil futures hit $77 a barrel in early July - the highest since late 2018 - on falling inventories and rising demand. Oil traded on Tuesday around $69 a barrel amid concerns that a spike in COVID-19 infections could dampen demand just as OPEC+ producers this week agreed to increase supply.
Second quarter profit rose to $227 million, or 26 cents per share, from $170 million, or 19 cents per share, in the first quarter. Wall Street anticipated earnings of 23 cents per share. Halliburton suffered a loss of $1.91 per share on impairment charges in the year-ago quarter.
""We believe that we are in the early innings of a multi-year up-cycle. For the first time in seven years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets,"" said Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller.
His bullish outlook includes drilling and well completions spending in North America rising by double-digit percentage gain over the next two years. He also expects double-digit growth in international oil activity for the second half of this year compared with the same period in 2020.
Shares were up 3.6% in afternoon trading at $20.06.
Halliburton reported $3.707 billion in revenue for the second quarter, slightly missing revenue estimates of $3.735 billion, according to data from Refinitiv IBES data.
Still, analysts said the results were positive, pointing to the earnings beat and improved margins.

""The margin performance that buoyed results should be enough to drive relative outperformance for HAL today,"" analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering & Holt Co wrote on Tuesday.
Rivals Baker Hughes Co and Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) also are expected to post quarterly profits after big losses a year ago.

Oil prices fell sharply following OPEC and its allies’ agreement on July 18 to increase production by 400,000 barrels each month beginning in August. Rising COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the hyper-contagious Delta variant also contributed to the decline in oil prices.

(Reuters) - The big question hanging over Harley Davidson Inc's second-quarter results on Wednesday will be a familiar one: has the 118-year old brand sold enough bikes?
After struggling to broaden its appeal beyond middle-aged and affluent riders for several years, the company has gone back to what it knows best, which is selling big bikes, and the decision is making inroads under Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz.
Analysts are still skeptical on whether the plan will be enough to boost volumes, which have fallen for six years through a struggle to target others riders.
Zeitz's plan includes selling used bikes, scraping entry-level models and ramping up investment in touring, large cruiser and trike bike segments - its main profit engines.
The company has also cut its production and reduced inventory to drive up the average selling price of new bikes.
""Reducing production doesn't necessarily stimulate demand for a product when sales have been declining for six years,"" UBS analyst Robin Farley wrote in a note.
TARGETED PLAN
Waning interest in motorcycling as a recreational activity as well as the price of Harley bikes, which can cost as much as a car, have hurt the company's efforts to woo younger riders.
Zeitz has aimed for low double-digit earnings growth through 2025. Since his plan was unveiled, Harley's stock is about 26% higher, a sign of confidence in Zeitz's abilities to turnaround Harley's fortunes, analysts say.
The company also reported a 31% year-on-year jump in retail sales in the United States in the first quarter, its first quarterly sales increase in its biggest market in six years.
Earlier this month, Harley launched its first electric bike from its LiveWire brand priced at $22,000, in a move aimed at hitting younger and more environmentally conscious riders who could eventually lift Harley's volumes as its core baby boomer audience grows old.
""From a from a turnaround standpoint, I think Jochen Zeitz (CEO) has done, a very good job, at least so far,"" Raymond James analyst Joseph Altobello said.
""(Harley's) prior management team lacked focus and kind of lost their way."" 
For interactive graphic click here: (https://tmsnrt.rs/3hQlDSw) 
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* In April, Harley raised its 2021 motorcycles segment revenue growth outlook to a range of 30% to 35%, from prior range of 20% to 25%.
* Analysts' mean estimate for Harley's second-quarter revenue is $1.41 billion, up 111% from a year earlier. Quarterly profit is expected to be about $180.5 million, compared with a loss of $92.2 million, a year earlier.
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
* Of 17 brokerages, eight rate Harley's stock ""buy"" or higher, seven ""hold"" and two ""sell"".

However, revenues were still far from pre-COVID levels and the Florentine brand is counting on the arrival of Burberry Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti at the helm later this year to step up turnaround efforts that have so far struggled to yield results. 
Ferragamo, which has been hit harder than most rivals by the fallout of the coronavirus crisis due to its exposure to travel spending, said on Tuesday first-half sales grew by 46.2% at constant exchange rates to 524 million euros ($617 million).
That is roughly a fifth below the level of January-June 2019, despite a 90.5% yearly jump in the second quarter alone.

It gave no guidance for the whole of 2021.
Most luxury groups have already reached, if not exceeded, pre-COVID levels. But the pandemic hit Ferragamo just as the family-owned firm strived to rejuvenate a brand famous for the shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn.
The task will now fall to Gobbetti, who is credited with relaunching Burberry by injecting fresh life into the British label. 
Sales figures for the first half, which do not include the perfume business, are broadly in line with analyst expectations gathered by Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Consumer Reports said Tuesday that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's ""Full Self-Driving"" software lacks safeguards and raised concerns the system's use on public roads puts the public at risk citing reports from drivers.
The influential consumer publication cited videos posted on social media of drivers using it and raised concerns about issues, including ""vehicles missing turns, scraping against bushes, and heading toward parked cars."" 
Consumer Reports said it plans to independently test the software update known as FSD Beta 9, as soon as its Model Y receives the update. 
Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) did not immediately comment.
""Videos of FSD Beta 9 in action don’t show a system that makes driving safer or even less stressful,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center. “Consumers are simply paying to be test engineers for developing technology without adequate safety protection.”
In April, Consumer Reports said its engineers were able to defeat safeguards on Tesla's Autopilot and get out of the driver's seat.
Last month, NHTSA disclosed it has opened 30 investigations into Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of use.
Autopilot, which handles some driving tasks, was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said.

The NTSB has criticized Tesla's lack of system safeguards for Autopilot, which allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.
Tesla said last week eligible owners can subscribe to FSD for $99 or $199 a month. Tesla says FSD's ""currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.

Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
In June, the company asked employees to return to offices for at least three days a week from early September, veering from the stance of other big technology firms that were permitting full remote work.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook had originally planned a summer return.
Many tech companies, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM), have opted for hybrid or permanent remote-work models.

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rose more than 1% Tuesday as Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst raised his target to $400 for the stock while maintaining a buy rating.
The new target is 17.5% higher than the stock’s current level of $340.50.
According to StreetInsider, analyst Brent Thill believes the Street’s estimates for the social media’s second-quarter revenue are too conservative. Thill says ad demand from verticals like retail, travel and movies that were most affected by the pandemic has exceeded prior expectations.
The analyst’s checks have indicated that concerns about the hit to Facebook’s revenue from Apple’s stricter privacy policy, as reflected in iOS14, have not come to fruition.
“We remain positive on FB stock, as we see a clear pathway to $16+ EPS by FY22, which at a mid-20x multiple implies a $415+ stock (20%+ upside),"" Thill wrote, according to StreetInsider.
Facebook expects second quarter 2021 year-over-year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly accelerate relative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021.
The company’s financial year is the same as calendar year. Its ad revenue in the first quarter of 2021 rose 46% year-on-year to $25.43 billion and 10% year-on-year to $18.32 billion in the second quarter of 2020."

Consider Adding These 4 Stocks to Your Portfolio,"Earlier this year, lumber prices rose to record highs on rising housing demand and supply constraints. However, prices declined significantly last month as people spent more on vacations than on building renovation projects just as lumber supplies increased with the reopening of sawmills. But since the housing boom shows no signs of fizzling, analysts expect lumber prices to rebound soon. So, we believe it's an opportune time to bet on lumber stocks West Fraser (WFG), PotlatchDeltic (NASDAQ:PCH), Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC), and Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL). Let’s take a closer look at these names.The demand for lumber to renovate and improve existing homes and do-it-yourself projects increased significantly over the last year because people spent more time at home. Also, the red-hot housing market led to high demand for lumber. However, as sawmills could not operate at full capacity during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply remained under pressure, causing a spike in lumber prices. In May, lumber prices hit a $1,670.50 per thousand board feet all-time high, increasing six times from the low it hit in April 2020. However, prices declined more than 40% in June—the worst monthly decline since 1978.
As people now focus on vacations and other outdoor activities after staying indoors for more than a year, demand for home remodeling has decreased. At the same time, the reopening of sawmills has led to an increase in supply. However, since the housing boom is expected to persist, analysts expect lumber prices to normalize by year's end. Furthermore, lumber prices are still up 100% versus the spring of 2020.
Since lumber prices are expected to rebound soon, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound lumber stocks West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG), PotlatchDeltic Corporation (PCH), Boise Cascade Company (BCC), and Lumber Liquidators Holding Inc. (LL).

As casinos resume their operations and digital gambling continues to attract consumers’ attention, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the upside potential of casino stocks. Specifically, analysts expect Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) and International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT) to rally by more than 50% over the next 12 months on their strong fundamentals and solid industry growth prospects.

However, now that pandemic restrictions are greatly eased, the economic recovery is picking up steam, and people are heading out for vacations, casinos are witnessing a substantial increase in foot traffic. The pent-up demand for gaming and gambling services could significantly boost the revenues of casino operators in the coming months. Consequently, the global gambling market is expected to reach $647.7 billion by 2025, growing at a 7% CAGR.
With most gaming properties now operating at full capacity, customer turnover is expected to surge significantly. Furthermore, the continued evolution of online casinos should boost the growth of casino operators.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker charged in connection with a multibillion-dollar scandal at Malaysia's state investment fund 1MDB won a Brooklyn judge's permission to replace his ankle monitor with a smaller one so he can jog more comfortably.
Federal prosecutors objected to the smaller ankle monitor, arguing that the former head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs in Malaysia could become a greater flight risk.
Lawyers for Roger Ng said the ""cumbersome and heavy nature"" of the GPS monitoring device, which constantly streamed Ng's location to authorities, made it uncomfortable for Ng to run, which is his preferred method of exercise.
U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie ruled the request to switch to the smaller device, which notifies authorities only when Ng leaves and returns to his home, was reasonable, in part because Ng has followed his probation terms for the past two years.
Ng is on probation pending trial in Brooklyn federal court where he stands accused of conspiring to violate an anti-bribery law and launder money. Ng pleaded not guilty to those charges last December.
Goldman Sachs helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, which former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak launched over a decade ago to promote economic development.
U.S. and Malaysian authorities said fund officials and accomplices looted some of the money to spend on luxuries and finance Hollywood films, while Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi for 1MDB business.
Tim Leissner, another former Goldman banker, pleaded guilty in 2018 over his role in the scandal. He has not been sentenced.

In May 2019, Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the United States, where he was released in exchange for a $20 million bond and required to wear an ankle bracelet. https://reut.rs/3wPGRUR

390,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",EU proposes watchdog to halt flow of dirty money,"By Huw Jones
(Reuters) -EU policymakers proposed a new agency on Tuesday to stop financial firms from aiding criminals and terrorists after a scandal at a Danish bank highlighted the inadequacy of the bloc's defences.
Europe came under pressure to step up enforcement of its anti-money laundering rules when several countries began investigating Danske Bank after more than 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of suspicious transactions passed through its tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Danske said in April it may be required to investigate its former Estonian branch further this year.
With no EU authority to stop money laundering and terrorist financing running into billions of euros, Brussels has relied on national regulators, but they have disagreed over who should be in charge and not always enforced rules consistently.
""The national turf we need to protect is the European Union,"" EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness told reporters.
""This package will correct those gaps in the framework.""
The EU Commission proposed creating an EU Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism Authority (AMLA) to directly supervise a yet-to-be-compiled list of cross-border financial firms considered the most risky, and to coordinate enforcement among national regulators.
AMLA could also intervene in companies not on the list if the national regulator has not taken sufficient action.
A levy on the risky firms will largely fund the new body, which should be fully up and running by 2026 with about 250 staff, including 100 to supervise the riskiest firms jointly with national regulators.
AMLA, which will cost 45.6 million euros to run and have powers to impose sanctions of up to 10 million euros or 10% of a firm's annual turnover, would strip the EU's European Banking Authority (EBA) of the role it has had since 2019 of coordinating enforcement of anti-money laundering rules.
The EBA's board in 2019 closed an inquiry into Danish and Estonian regulators regarding Danske Bank without explanation, even though the two national regulators were found in breach of EU law.
BAGS OF CASH
The European Savings and Retail Banking Group said it hoped the proposal would strengthen the fight against financial crime and called for clear regulation and efficient responsibility sharing between the new EU authority and national ones.
Danish banking lobby Finans Danmark said strong common rules were needed to fight cross-border economic crime, but it was important to avoid duplication between AMLA and national watchdogs.
The EU package also includes making the bloc's anti-money laundering rules more detailed and slotting them into a single rulebook by the end of 2025 to stop criminals exploiting differences between national regulators, the Commission said.
Companies handling virtual assets, such as bitcoin, would become subject to anti-money laundering rules, along with transparency requirements for transfers of crypto assets.
The European Commission also proposed an EU-wide limit of 10,000 euros ($12,000) on cash transfers.

""If you allow bagfuls of cash to purchase luxury goods then questions have to be asked about the origin of that money,"" McGuinness said.
EU states and the European Parliament have the final say over the commission proposals in a negotiation process that can take around two years.

(Reuters) -India's excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic could be as high as 4.9 million, a new study shows, providing further evidence that millions more may have died from coronavirus than the official tally.
The report by the Washington-based Center for Global Development, co-authored by India's former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, included deaths from all causes since the start of the pandemic through June this year. 
India's official tally of more than 414,000 deaths is the world's third highest after the United States and Brazil, but the study adds to growing calls from experts for a rigorous nationwide audit of fatalities. 
A devastating rise in infections in April and May, driven largely by the more infectious and dangerous Delta variant, overwhelmed the healthcare system and killed at least 170,000 people in May alone, official data show.
""What is tragically clear is that too many people, in the millions rather than hundreds of thousands, may have died,"" the report said, estimating between 3.4 million and 4.9 million excess deaths during the pandemic.
But it did not ascribe all excess deaths to the pandemic.
""We focus on all-cause mortality, and estimate excess mortality relative to a pre-pandemic baseline, adjusting for seasonality,"" the authors said https:// 
The health ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment. 
Some experts have said excess deaths are the best way to measure the real toll from COVID-19.
""For every country, it's important to capture excess mortality - the only way to prepare the health system for future shocks and to prevent further deaths,"" Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization, said on Twitter https:// The New York Times said the most conservative estimate of deaths in India was 600,000 and the worst-case scenario several times that. The government has dismissed those figures. Health experts blame the undercounting largely on scarce resources in the vast hinterland home to two-thirds of India's population of nearly 1.4 billion, and also many deaths at home without being tested. India has reported a decline in daily infections from a May peak, with Tuesday's 30,093 new cases making up its lowest daily count in four months.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also been criticised for a messy vaccination campaign that many say helped worsen the second wave of infections. 
Just over 8% of eligible adult Indians have received both vaccine doses. In July, the government administered fewer than 4 million daily doses on average, down from a record 9.2 million on June 21, when Modi flagged off a free campaign to inoculate all 950 million adults.

One big change was a pair of comments from Fox News personalities urging people to get their shots. ""If you have the chance, get the shot, it will save your life,"" Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy said during his show on Monday.
His colleague and Fox News host Sean Hannity also asked viewers to take the pandemic “seriously” and said he believes in the “science of vaccines.""
The remarks are in contrast to Fox host Tucker Carlson, whose show is the highest-rated on cable in the U.S. and a platform for him to dabble in anti-vaccination conspiracy theories.
The divergence of views between Fox anchors comes amid resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and elsewhere, mostly because of the spread of the Delta variant, a strain more than twice as contagious as earlier iterations of the virus.
Infection rates are rising, particularly in the South and Midwest, where skepticism toward vaccines - and to most policies of the Democratic administration - runs highest. The number of new cases across the U.S. hit its highest one-day mark in over two months last week.
While the Biden administration vaccinated more than half the U.S. population with at least one dose in quick time, subsequent progress has been tough to come by because of vaccine hesitancy, which has been reinforced by disinformation on social media platforms.
The federal government has accused social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of providing platform for vaccine disinformation, something Facebook has denied.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>","U.S. insurer Travelers posts profit beat on underwriting, investments","(Reuters) - U.S. property and casualty insurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Cos Inc smashed second-quarter profit expectations on Tuesday, helped by higher premiums, lower catastrophe losses and a surge in returns from investments.
The New York-based company, seen as a bellwether for the sector, beat analysts' average earnings per share forecast by more than $1.00, or about 44%. 
The company suggested strong profitability would continue, as its ability to raise prices in commercial lines would exceed the rise in losses, or payouts, in the months ahead.
""We expect pricing to outpace loss trends for some time,"" Alan Schnitzer, Travelers CEO, said on a conference call, referring to the company's business insurance and bond & specialty insurance units.
But a weaker result in Travelers' auto insurance business reflected higher costs and altered driving habits as Americans emerge from COVID-19 isolation. Not only are people driving less at rush hours and more at other times, they tend to be more distracted, Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome said. 
Travelers noted the soaring cost of used cars had meant higher payouts for accidents.
Travelers shares were down about 0.5% at $150.57 on Tuesday, after rising sharply over the last few weeks.
Travelers' results suggest other insurers will post strong investment returns for the second quarter. Travelers' pre-tax net investment income more than tripled to $818 million, as higher returns on its non-fixed income investments countered weakness in the mainstay fixed-income assets that have struggled due to record-low interest rates. 
Travelers said net written premiums, a measure of revenue, jumped 11% to $8.14 billion.
Its adjusted, or core, income totaled $879 million, or $3.45 per share, for the three months ended June 30, far more than the $2.39 analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
In the year-ago period, the insurer reported a loss of $50 million, or 20 cents a share, due to severe storms and claims related to civil unrest.
The reopening of economies with the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations has provided some respite to insurers, helping Travelers retain customers and expand its auto and homeowners-focused businesses.
The company posted underwriting gains of $324 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $280 million a year ago. 

Catastrophe losses fell to $475 million in the latest quarter from $854 million a year ago.
Total revenues rose 17% to $8.69 billion, and the company said it bought back $401 million worth of shares in the quarter.

The German reinsurer said in an unscheduled announcement that expenses for major losses were below average in the period, due to relatively low losses from natural catastrophes.
Preliminary net profit rose to around 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), the company said. That is up from 579 million euros last year when it was hit by heavy losses related to the coronavirus pandemic.
It is also higher than the 808 million euros expected by analysts.
Munich Re said that it was ""well on track"" to meet its annual profit target of 2.8 billion euros.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 10:32AM ET</span>",Analysis-Top brewers toast easing of pandemic curbs with zero alcohol beer,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Joyce Philippe
BRUSSELS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - While many drinkers may celebrate the easing of pandemic restrictions with a beer or glass of wine, the world's biggest brewers will be urging them to try new zero alcohol lagers.
Having lost market share to craft beers and hard seltzers - or alcoholic fizzy water - top brewers like AB InBev and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) are betting on a new generation of non-alcoholic beers to help regain ground by tapping into healthy-living trends.
But the pandemic cancelled business lunches, emptied sports facilities and left no one driving back from parties or bars - all prime territories for sales of zero alcohol drinks.
Global non-alcohol beer sales fell 4.6% in 2020 in value terms to $11.6 billion after 9% average annual growth in the previous four years, according to market research provider Euromonitor International.
The ending of restrictions in the United States and Europe is now making it easier for brewers to get drinkers to try out new zero alcohol versions of their top-selling brands - something they believe will be crucial to ramping up sales. 
""The main barrier for consumers is expectations, as in that they do not expect it to taste good,"" said Borja Manso-Salinas, vice president for marketing of the Heineken brand in the United States. 
At a sampling session at the Pier 17 concert and dining venue in lower Manhattan this month, Heineken broke that barrier for some passers-by, including Cary Heinz who brought over a regular Heineken from a nearby stand to compare.
""I can't tell the difference. And I'm a real drinker,"" he said, with a can in each hand. 
Previously, many zero beers were effectively cooked to evaporate alcohol, spoiling the taste. Brewers often now use a vacuum chamber so alcohol comes off at a lower temperature and sometimes seek to blend back escaped esters that are central to the flavour.
The world's second largest brewer launched Heineken 0.0 in the United States in 2019 and planned to distribute 10 million free cans last year, but managed less than half that because of the pandemic.
The Dutch brewer believes it is back on track in 2021, with around four million free samples going to offices alone. Other samples are bound for music festivals, apartment buildings and shopping malls.
Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev), the world's and the United States' largest brewer, also launched a zero version of its flagship Budweiser lager in the United States a year ago.
""Historically, one of the barriers to overcome is taste,"" said Todd Allen, global marketing vice president of the Budweiser brand. 
""It's really important for people to try the product.""
'ADULT SOFT DRINK'
Europe represents almost three-quarters of non-alcoholic beer drunk, market research company insightSLICE says. In Spain, zero alcohol beers make up 13% of all beer sales. 
In Japan, where nearly 5% of beer sales contain no alcohol, brewers are launching new brands and forecasting steep growth.
However, the United States is almost virgin territory, with zero alcohol's market share just 0.5%, according to Euromonitor. 
IWSR Drinks Market Analysis says 2019 marked a turning point, with growth after three years of decline. 
For the five years to 2025 it sees a near tripling of U.S. non-alcohol beer volumes, far outpacing global expansion of around 60%, helped by new launches and health trends. U.S. beer sales as a whole are seen down 18% over the same period. 
Such growth could be vital to the big brewers which have faced battles on two fronts in recent years - from craft brews, now some 12% of U.S. beer, and from hard seltzers, which have doubled U.S. sales each year since the market took off in 2016. 
Zero alcohol is different. The major brewers are front-runners rather than late arrivals and their new products may take share from soft drinks rather than the core beer market. 
Non-alcoholic drinks also typically offer higher margins, with a higher cost of production offset by lower excise tax. 
Allen said the category performed proportionately better among the new generation of drinkers, a clear positive. 
Brewers highlight beer has ""natural"" ingredients, unlike many soft drinks. Budweiser Zero campaigns also stress it has no sugar and its calorie count is a third that of regular Bud.
Consumers are no longer just drivers, teetotallers or pregnant women, brewers say, with most also drinking alcohol, but just choosing to abstain according to the occasion.
Brewers see big potential at U.S. sports events, many of which ban alcohol sales towards the end of a game, but also see zero alcohol beer entering new territory.
Trevor Stirling, senior beverage analyst at Bernstein Autonomous, said the key was for brewers to make non-alcoholic beer a lifestyle choice, for example replacing a morning soda at work, rather than just a beer substitute.
""It's a massive opportunity, but difficult to do. They need to change the frame of reference so that, for example, consumers see it less as a beer with no alcohol but a non-alcoholic drink that tastes of beer, an adult soft drink,"" he said.

Heineken Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink believes non-alcoholic beer could account for about 5% of the global beer market over time. It was around 2% by value in 2020, according to Euromonitor. 
""The biggest mistake we could make would be taking our foot off the gas. We're still only early in this journey,"" he said.

So, we believe it could be wise to bet on quality large-cap tech stocks Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), SAP (SAP), and QUALCOMM (QCOM). They are positioned to hold steady amid the short-term market volatility and generate big returns over the long run. Let’s discuss.After hitting all-time highs, the major stock market indexes saw a mild correction over the past week, reflecting investors’ concerns over the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus and high inflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell nearly 3% over the past week to close yesterday’s trading session at 14,274.98.
Because the market is expected to remain volatile, we think it could be wise to invest in quality large-cap tech stocks. That’s because large-cap stocks are known for withstanding market volatility and delivering stable returns, and the technology industry is showing much promise with the ongoing digital transformation across several industries. Because the demand for the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, among other advanced technologies, is expected to continue rising, the tech industry is well-positioned to grow. According to Statista, there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide as of January 2021, representing 59.5% of the global population. This number is expected to rise further, which could lead to increasing demand for advanced technological solutions.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound large-cap tech stocks Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), SAP SE (DE:SAPG) (SAP), and QUALCOMM (QCOM) to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Our POWR Ratings system has rated each of these stocks as Strong Buy.

However, given that the company is now under investigation and its business growth prospects look bleak, will the stock continue to rally? Read on.
Software solutions provider SCWorx Corp. (WORX) develops advanced applications and software to manage healthcare providers' services. It also sells rapid test kits for COVID-19 and personal protective equipment. WORX’s stock has gained 52.1% over the past month, driven by the meme stock frenzy.

However, its stock is currently trading 55.9% below its $5.76 all-time, indicating short-term bearishness.
WORX is currently under an investigation initiated by the former Attorney General of Louisiana for its alleged failure to provide accurate publicly available information regarding its supply agreement to sell COVID-19 test kits. In addition, WORX’s growth prospects have been adversely affected by the focus of most of its customers in the healthcare sector on meeting the nation’s healthcare needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to that, the company has failed to generate substantial revenue from the sale of PPE or rapid test kits in the last reported quarter.

PARIS (Reuters) -Virgil Abloh, fashion's highest profile Black designer, is getting a bigger role within French luxury group LVMH, which is taking a majority stake in his Off-White streetwear label.
Abloh, 40, a U.S. national who also works as a DJ and visual artist, was hired by LVMH in March 2018 to create menswear collections for Louis Vuitton, the luxury giant's biggest revenue driver.
He will continue in that role while also working with the group to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond fashion, the company said on Tuesday.
His arrival at LVMH marked the marriage between streetwear and high-end fashion, mixing sneakers and camouflage pants with tailored suits and evening gowns. His influences include graffiti art, hip hop and skateboard culture. 
The style was embraced by the world's biggest luxury group - led by France's richest man, 72-year old Bernard Arnault - as it sought to breathe new life into some labels and attract younger customers.
The sale to LVMH and higher profile for Abloh also show renewed interest from the group in launching new brands, after putting its Fenty label fashion venture with Rihanna on hold in February.
Over the past three years, Abloh has drawn on messages of inclusivity and gender-fluidity to expand the Louis Vuitton label's popularity, weaving themes of racial identity into his fashion shows with poetry performances and art installations. 
With an eye to reaching Asian consumers grounded by the coronavirus pandemic, the designer sent his collections of colourful suits and utilitarian-flavoured outerwear off to Shanghai last summer when many labels cancelled fashion shows. 
More recently, he designed U.S. film director Spike Lee's clothes, including a hot pink double-breasted suit, for this month's Cannes film festival, where Lee chaired the jury. 
LVMH is also purchasing a 60% stake of Abloh’s Off-White label, which will be folded into the spirits-to-jewellery conglomerate.
Abloh will retain a 40% stake and continue as creative director of Off-White, which he founded in 2013. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Abloh, who was raised near Chicago by parents from Ghana, said LVMH would help him to develop Off-White into a ""truly multi-line luxury brand"" while he hoped his expanded role at the French company would also help to foster diversity in the industry.
The prolific designer has drawn on his training in engineering and architecture for a wide range of products, collaborating with LVMH-owned Rimowa on a line of see-through suitcases as well as champagne bottles for the group's label Moet & Chandon. 
He also introduced popular partnerships with brands such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Ikea.
Abloh first gained experience at the luxury group as an intern at LVMH-owned Fendi, alongside Kanye West, in 2009.
The Off-White brand is known for its luxury urban style, featuring hoodies that start at around 400 pounds ($543.64).

LVMH earlier this month took a minority stake in a new clothing and accessories label that is being launched by the former Celine designer Phoebe Philo under her own name.

LONDON (Reuters) -EasyJet plans to fly 60% of its pre-pandemic capacity in July-September as a travel recovery takes hold in mainland Europe, and Britain is expected to catch-up in the coming weeks. 
The British airline said it was confident on demand for the summer and autumn, issuing its most buoyant update since the start of the pandemic almost a year and a half ago, and allowing it to lift capacity from just 17% of 2019 levels in March-June. 
The travel pick-up has to date been led by the European Union, said easyJet (LON:EZJ), leading it to shift planes from Britain to markets including Scandinavia and Holland.
Two-thirds of bookings are currently coming from the rest of Europe, while normally its business is evenly split between Britain and the continent, but easyJet expects that to change now travel rules for fully-vaccinated Britons have been relaxed.
""I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the UK demand will follow the same pattern that we're seeing outside the UK in mainland Europe,"" chief executive Johan Lundgren told reporters on Tuesday. 
Lundgren has been one of the most vocal critics of Britain's approach to travel over the last two months, slamming last-minute changes which have resulted in booking surges and mass cancellations.
Britain should add more countries to its ""green list"" of low-risk destinations, Lundgren said. 
Asked about worries quarantine could be reintroduced for Britons returning from Spain, as it was for France recently, he said easyJet was flexible.
""We set ourselves up to be able to cope with shifting demands,"" he said.
Shares in easyJet traded up 2% to 785 pence at 0845 GMT. The stock has lost about 20% of its value over the last month over worries about the impact of strict UK travel rules. 
The airline's plan for more flights in July-September, when it tends to make almost all of its profit, is being mirrored at rivals such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. 
EasyJet, which has shed staff, cut the size of its fleet and taken on new debt to survive, said it was well-placed financially, with 2.9 billion pounds ($4 billion) of liquidity, and had cut costs to improve its cash burn rate. 

But it said limited visibility and ongoing uncertainty meant it could not provide guidance for the rest of the year. For the three months to June 30, easyJet posted a pretax loss of 318 million pounds.

The European Commission issued the fine on the world's most popular internet search engine in 2017 for favouring its own price-comparison shopping service and giving it an unfair advantage against smaller European rivals.
Google told the Luxembourg-based General Court at a hearing last year that making innovative products was the core of its business model rather than helping rivals. It denied favouring its own service.
The court and Google did not respond immediately to requests for comment or confirmation of the EU ruling date.
The losing side can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's top court.
Google has racked up a total of 8.25 billion euros in EU antitrust fines related to this price comparison shopping case and two other cases in the last decade.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened modestly higher on Tuesday, but another sign of the housing market weakening took much of the energy out of an overnight rebound. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 140 points, or 0.4%, at 34,105 points, recouping only one fifth of its 2% loss on Monday, when the market was gripped by fears of another Covid-19-driven slowdown. 
The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite, which had outperformed on the way down on Monday, was down another 0.2%.
Earlier, building permit data for June surprisingly fell 5.1%, to their lowest level since November. Granular data from the report showed a drop in permits across all major regions, against a backdrop of higher raw materials prices and anecdotal labor shortages.  Housing starts rose, but Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson argued that the starts number ""was more noise than signal.""
""Housing market activity, both sales and starts, has not yet fully adjusted to the near-30% drop in mortgage applications since their December peak, so we expect further declines over the next few months,"" Shepherdson said, adding that it's still far from clear that mortgage applications have bottomed out after falling from their post-Covid peak.
Fears about a resurgence of the pandemic were evident in a 7.2% rise in  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock and a 5.1% rise in  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock. BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock meanwhile, also hit a new record high with a 2.0% gain. The stocks were also supported by signs of a change in policy at Fox News, where host Sean Hannity and others have suddenly swung behind supporting the national vaccination campaign. Fox has so far been a conduit for some of the more skeptical opinions toward Covid-19 vaccines. 
On a heavy day for earnings,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) stock stood out with a 4.8% gain after revenue growth - its Achilles' heel for the last decade - came in substantially above expectations, bolstering confidence in its transformation into a Cloud-centered service provider. 
HCA (NYSE:HCA) stock also stood out, rising 11% after it too provided a quarterly update well ahead of forecasts, mirroring larger rival UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) in profiting from a resumption of non-Covid-related procedures as the pandemic eases. Revenue rose 30% from a year earlier, while comparable emergency room visits rose 40%. The company also raised its guidance for the year. Elsewhere in health, a new partnership with UnitedHealth helped Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rise 3.2%, more than recouping its losses from Monday.
On the downside,  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock fell 2.2% as a number of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, extended their declines. Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock also fell 7.2% after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos completed his first jaunt into space with a low-orbit flight lasting just over 10 minutes. The flight underlined that Virgin will face competition all the way in the nascent space tourism business."

HELSINKI (Reuters) -Elevator and escalator maker Kone beat quarterly operating profit forecasts on Wednesday, helped by strong growth in North America and China, but warned of higher costs over the full year due mainly to the global semiconductor shortage. 
The Finnish company said it would likely have to rise prices to offset the higher costs, and lowered the top end of its adjusted operating profit margin guidance for 2021 to 12.4-13.0% of sales from 12.4-13.2% previously.
Second-quarter operating profit climbed to 367.1 million euros ($433.1 million) from 315.5 million a year ago, beating the 345.8 million euro mean estimate of 14 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Chief Executive Henrik Ehrnrooth highlighted in a press conference growth in Kone's maintenance business, as well as in North America and China. 
The company forecast material and logistics costs would be 175 million euros higher this year than in 2020 and identified the semiconductor shortage as its main issue. 
""Around 40 million of that has already come through,"" Ehrnrooth told Reuters.
""We have been able to compensate the impact pretty well but now the focus will be in rising prices,"" he said, adding Kone had also redesigned products to be able to take semiconductors from new suppliers.
On the change in margin guidance, OP Markets analyst Anssi Raussi said: ""We expected a slight tweak which now maybe came a bit sooner than we expected. If the raw material costs keep rising, there is a risk that (Kone) has to bring the range down some more.""

Investing.com – Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) stock was up more than 4% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as higher spending by clients helped it return to profitability in the second quarter.
The advertising, communications and public relations group posted $348.2 million net income in the second quarter compared to a net loss of $24.2 million in the second quarter of 2020. Revenue rose 27% to $3.57 billion.
The improved performance in the second quarter was amplified because of the 2020 corresponding quarter being one of the worst for the group.
Advertising and Omnicom’s solutions for managing customer relationships led the growth in the company’s revenue.
Most of the markets grew in excess of 20% with some like Europe and North America, excluding U.S., growing over 34%-37%%. The U.S. market rose 20%.   
The numbers were also positively impacted because of the sale of media specialty business ICOn and a lower tax impact.

Investing.com – Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock was trading 1% higher in Tuesday’s premarket after the company gave a brighter outlook for the ongoing financial year and said it expected annual revenue to rise 6%-7%.
It had previously forecast 5%-7% growth.
The maker of Rothmans cigarettes expects its annual adjusted diluted earnings per share to come between $5.79 and $5.89, higher by 12%-14% and more than the $5.75-$5.85 estimate it gave in April.   
The company added that the semiconductor shortage will not hurt supply of its vaping devices.
Philip Morris expects most of its markets to come out of pandemic-related restrictions in the second half of the year and assumes that even if lockdowns were to be extended, consumption wouldn’t compress to levels seen last year.
Cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volumes are seen flat to 2% higher. This is an improvement from previous projections which even indicated a fall in volumes.  
The company’s net revenue rose 14% to $7.59 billion in the second quarter but fell short of analysts’ estimate of $7.66 billion.
Adjusted diluted EPS rose almost 22% to $1.57 and beat analysts’ estimate of $1.54.
The company took a pre-tax charge of $246 million in the second quarter owing to a customs dispute in Saudi Arabia.
The company, which has been turning more to non-tobacco products, said cigarette shipments rose 3.2% and those of heated tobacco units jumped 30%.
The company said its all-cash acquisition of Fertin Pharma, a manufacturer of innovative pharmaceutical and well-being products, will close in the fourth quarter of 2021.

(Reuters) -  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), the company led by  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, is launching banking services for small businesses, as it continues to grow beyond payments processing. 
Square Banking will offer small businesses savings and checking accounts, as well as its existing lending offering which has been renamed Square Loans, the San Francisco-based company said on Tuesday. 
Square Checking will have no account minimums, overdraft fees, or recurring fees and saving accounts will offer a 0.5% annual percent yield on deposits.
Square hopes its new checking and savings accounts, which build upon its debit card offering, will be attractive to small businesses who have struggled to gain access to more mainstream banking services, said Christina Riechers, Square Banking's head of product. 
""There is no monthly fee so we see this as having high potential to get folks into more formalized business banking,"" Riechers said in an interview. 
Deposits collected from small businesses will be lent back through Square Loans, she said.
The new services come following the launch of the company's industrial bank, Square Financial Services, which began operations in March after completing the charter approval process with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.
The industrial bank is part of efforts by Square to expand its revenue stream beyond facilitating card payments for small businesses.
The company's consumer business Cash App has been booming, with first quarter revenue excluding bitcoin investing up 139% year on year to $529 million. 
While initially, only small business deposits will be brought under the Square Financial Services umbrella, over time the company will look to have the bank work across its range of products and services, a spokesman said.
The renamed lending business will continue to offer loans to sellers based on data from their transactions.

The business, previously called Square Capital, saw revenues drop during the pandemic, with the company pausing its main loan offering for small businesses to focus instead on offering government-funded Paycheck Protection Program loans. 
Since restarting lending the company says it has seen volumes recovering.

The proposed rules would apply to clearing houses like LCH, part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG), LME Clear and ICE (NYSE:ICE) Clear Europe, and settlement house Euroclear.
The existing rules were introduced after too few individuals were punished for failures during the financial crisis more than a decade ago and they aim make senior managers directly accountable for their actions.
The finance ministry said the current regime had only limited provision for oversight of individual conduct at financial markets infrastructure firms, companies that ensure that a transaction like a stock or bond trade is completed smoothly.
Under the proposals put out to public consultation, the Bank of England would have powers to decide which senior individuals at these firms would come under the regime.

""This would ensure that the firms which underpin the proper functioning and overall stability of the UK’s financial system are subject to the highest regulatory standards,"" the ministry said.
""The government intends to legislate for this new regime when parliamentary time allows.""

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s plans to revive its slowing subscriber growth will be in focus when it reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, as lockdown binge-watching subsides and competition from Disney+ and HBO Max ramps up.
Netflix has forecast it would add just 1 million subscribers globally in the second quarter, a tenth of what it added a year ago when COVID-19 restrictions forced people to seek entertainment at home.
The streaming pioneer has also been losing market share to new services such as Disney+, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Apple TV+, WarnerMedia's HBO Max and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Peacock. To be sure, the industry's overall subscriber growth has also slowed as the U.S. market saturates. 
Graphic: Netflix demand drops as competition peaks: https://graphics.reuters.com/NETFLIX-RESULTS/egpbknnqovq/chart_eikon.jpg 
THE CONTEXT
Some Wall Street analysts have said a first-mover advantage will only take it so far and that Netflix needs to produce new content, renew content licenses and explore other revenue sources such as live sports and advertising to turbo-charge growth.
Co-CEO Reed Hastings has long been opposed to adopting an advertising model saying it would have to compete with market leaders Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The company is exploring an e-commerce push to sell content-related merchandise and recently hired Facebook executive Mike Verdu to anchor its gaming expansion.
But analysts are skeptical about the gaming move.
""While this strategy could be marginally accretive to Netflix's member and revenue growth, we doubt the platform would be meaningfully competitive with endemic gaming platforms or content publishers anytime soon,"" said Matthew Thornton, analyst at Truist Securities.
For now, Netflix is under intense pressure to produce new content, after big hits like ""Emily in Paris"", ""Bridgerton"", ""The Queen's Gambit"" and ""The Crown"" in 2020. The pandemic delayed production, but the company has announced new seasons of ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark"" among others coming next year. 
Graphic: Fewer new signups for Netflix as restrictions ease: https://graphics.reuters.com/NETFLIX-RESULTS/oakveddwopr/chart_eikon.jpg 
FUNDAMENTALS 
* Analysts estimate Netflix's second-quarter revenue to grow 19% to $7.32 billion. Revenue in North America, its biggest region by revenue, is set to increase by 13.4%. 
* Earnings per share is estimated at $3.16
* Its shares have lost 1.5% year-to-date, while the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 13.4%.
* The stock, which soared 67% in 2020, is also the weakest performer among FAANG stocks this year.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>",Analysis-SPAC u-turn mars Ackman's hedge fund pivot,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - It was poised to be William Ackman's brilliant pivot from activist hedge fund manager to prominent dealmaker. It ended up souring his rebranding. 
Ackman last year launched a $4 billion special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the largest blank-check acquisition firm ever raised. With backing from his investors and available bank debt, he amassed enough firepower to take public a company worth tens of billions of dollars.
Last month, however, Ackman unveiled plans to buy a 10% stake in Universal Music Group, which its owner Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SA was already planning to spin off into a public company.
Shareholders of his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, would receive Universal shares once the music label's stock market flotation was completed and would not get a vote on it. Tontine would carry on in search of another deal, with $1.5 billion in capital left to deploy. Tontine investors would also receive warrants in a new blank-check company launched by Ackman that would pursue another, yet-to-be-determined deal.
Ackman's financial engineering proved too much for Tontine investors and U.S. regulators. Tontine shares dropped 18% in the weeks after the deal was announced. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushed back on the deal by arguing it would not comply with New York Stock Exchange rules, Ackman said.
By Monday, Ackman changed direction on the SPAC as criticism about his moves mounted. 
He will now replace Tontine in the deal with his hedge fund vehicles and will seek co-investments from other outside investors to pull off a transaction he made over a handshake with French businessman Vincent Bollore last month. Sources familiar with his thinking said he expects the investments in the new co-investment vehicle to be oversubscribed. 
But three long-standing Pershing Square investors said they were skeptical pension funds, family offices and sovereign wealth funds would step up. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of agreements they have signed with Pershing Square.
When Ackman offered his previous co-investment vehicles to investors in companies such as Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) and Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD), the allure was the potential pop in the stock once Ackman's position became public. This will not be the case now as the deal valuing Universal Music Group at $35 billion is already known, and, some of Ackman's critics argue, overpriced.
""He's pulled a switcheroo by announcing an investment in a company instead of a merger to take a company public any many investors didn't like it,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan said about the Universal Music deal. 
Ackman declined to comment.
Ackman is obligated to invest $2 billion and can invest as much as $4 billion in Universal Music Group, which has the rights to artists ranging from Taylor Swift to Drake. Potential investors have not yet seen terms for what would be Pershing Square's seventh co-investment vehicle. 
REBUILDING RETURNS
The last few years set records at New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management, with Ackman posting returns of 70.2% return in 2020 and a 58.1% return in 2019. The successes followed double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 and smaller declines in 2017 and 2018. Turning his back on stumbles in Valeant and  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF), Ackman adopted a back-to-basics theme by ending investor visits that were eating into his time and hunkering down in the office to do research.
Two years ago, Ackman told clients his hedge fund would transform itself into a holding company that owns stakes in public companies and offers a helping hand to struggling management teams to resurrect once-strong returns.

This year Pershing Square Holdings has returned 6.5% while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has gained roughly 15%.
""Some investors will stay loyal to Ackman, of course, because they have seen him goof up before and then buckle down and win again,"" University of Michigan's Gordon said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, rebounding from Monday’s hefty losses, helped by strong results from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 150 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 70 points, or 0.5%.
The major equity indices closed sharply lower on Wall Street Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping more than 700 points, or 2.1%, to post its worst day since October. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1%.
Investors deserted the equity markets amid fears the latest surge in U.S. Covid-19 cases, largely due to the fast-spreading delta variant, could prompt officials to impose new lockdowns and business closures.
President Joe Biden, in a speech Monday, pleaded with the populace to get vaccinated to help boost the nation’s economic recovery, citing higher rates of Covid-19 in states with low vaccination rates.
Meanwhile, IBM (NYSE:IBM) will be in the spotlight after the tech giant reported better than expected second-quarter revenue growth after the close Monday, boosted by strong growth in its Cloud and consulting businesses.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could also be in focus following a Bloomberg report that the iPhone maker is seeking an expansion in Hollywood, looking to deepen its commitment to streaming content. 
The earnings season is set to continue Tuesday, with numbers from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) the highlight of Tuesday’s session. The streaming giant was one of the clear winners of the pandemic’s stay at home lifestyle, but analysts will want to see its expectations for subscriber growth as life returns to normal. They'll also want comment on any plans it may have to add videogaming to its service.
Investors will also study results from the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), to gauge the return of customers to restaurants, and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), over whether the surge in travel demand can last.
The economic data slate centers around the housing market, with June building permits and housing starts due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Tuesday, after the previous session’s sharp selloff on the back of worries that increased Covid cases will hit the short-term demand for energy just as a group of top producers agreed to increase supply.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, Last week’s number showed the smallest draw on inventories in five weeks, suggesting that the rebound in demand in the U.S. may be slackening in the near term.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Europe's biggest home appliances maker, Electrolux, reported earnings above pre-pandemic levels on Tuesday but saw its shares slump 9% after it warned of worsening component supply problems in coming months.
The Swedish group posted an operating profit of 1.98 billion crowns ($228 million) for the second quarter, versus a loss of 62 million a year earlier. In the second quarter of 2019, it generated a profit of 1.62 billion crowns. 
The rebound came on the back of a 39% sales increase as consumers kept spending more on home improvement during the pandemic. 
However, irregular deliveries of electronic components - mainly microcontrollers - due to a global supply chain squeeze hampered production, and the April-June profit lagged analysts' expectations.
""The global supply challenges experienced in the first half are expected to have a higher impact in the second half of the year,"" Electrolux said in a statement. 
""The market for electronic components is expected to be somewhat more constrained in the third quarter and, hence, we anticipate challenges to fully meet the market’s product mix requirements,"" it said, adding that the situation was likely to remain uncertain for an extended period of time.
The news sent Electrolux's shares down 9% by 1009 GMT, reducing a year-to-date rise to 13%. 
CEO Jonas Samuelson told Reuters that sub-suppliers and suppliers were struggling to stock up on the various kinds of microcontrollers that are essential in most appliances. 
""The supply chain has simply been drained,"" he said. ""The ability to respond quickly to swings in the demand mix is limited because there are no buffers in the system. This situation has gradually worsened this year and we will probably see even more of those effects."" 
The rival to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) said that in the second quarter it had fully offset higher costs for raw materials, electronic components and logistics through price increases to customers, and that it expected to manage to do so for the full year as well. 
It expects demand to start normalising in the second half - the new normal being higher than before the pandemic as people remain more hygiene conscious and spend more time at home - albeit with big regional variances driven by pandemic developments and government stimulus programmes.
Electrolux on Monday said it was raising its dividend policy and proposed to distribute 17 crowns per share this year through a share redemption. It also said it planned to buy back more shares.

(Reuters) -Remy Cointreau forecast on Tuesday an ""excellent"" first half after it more than doubled its organic sales in the first three months of the fiscal year as bars and restaurants reopened from lockdowns in Europe and the United States.
Yet even as it handily beat sales estimates, its shares fell as much as 2.6% in early trade with investors disappointed the maker of Remy Martin cognac stuck with full-year outlook of ""mid-teens"" organic sales growth.
""We would highlight that a strong first quarter was anticipated given easy comparatives and shipment phasing,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Edward Mundy said in a note, describing the unchanged outlook as ""conservative"".
Remy Cointreau, which last year bore the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis alongside other premium spirits makers, said sales in the quarter ended June 30 were boosted by Europe's and the United States' reopening as well as continued strong demand in China and buoyant at home consumption.
Finance chief Luca Marotta told analysts he still wanted to stay ""prudent"" about the second quarter performance, which would depend on the European summer season and the effects of the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus.
Marotta said the fiscal year started April 1 would be a ""year of two halves"", with growth expected to slow down in the second half once customers finish replenishing their inventories.
The Paris-based group, which also makes champagnes and scotch, reported first-quarter organic sales more than doubled to 293.1 million euros ($345.48 million), beating market expectations of a 68% rise and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in the same period two years ago.

Remy Cointreau, whose upscale spirits can cost thousands of dollars per bottle with custom engravings, said its cognac division saw organic sales rise 114%, against consensus of 86%, making up more than two thirds of group sales in the quarter.

Investing.com –  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) stock was up 4% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after the tech giant’s second-quarter earnings and top line both beat estimates and forecast a strong year overall.
The former market bellwether said it is on track to achieve $11 billion to $12 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year.
Total revenue rose 3.4% to $18.74 billion, the biggest gain in three years for a company that has struggled to reinvent itself as a Cloud-based service provider and return to sustainable revenue growth. Diluted adjusted earnings per share rose 7% to $2.33.
Analysts had expected the company to report EPS of $2.32 on revenue of $18.29 billion.
IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna attributed the topline growth to more clients being willing to adopt the company’s hybrid Cloud model and AI services. A hybrid model allows corporates to use outsourced Cloud-based servers as well as its own. This blended model allows clients to derive two-and-a-half-times more value, according to Krishna.
Revenue in both the segments grew by more than 10%. Gross profit margin expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The company said it now has 3,200 clients using its hybrid Cloud, almost four times what it had before buying Red Hat in 2019. Red Hat revenue rose 20%. 
The company used the higher cash flows to pay off $6.4 billion in debt in the first six months of 2021, ending with $55.2 billion debt as of June 30.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Global quest underway to speed COVID-19 vaccine trials,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Ludwig Burger
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists are working on a benchmark for COVID-19 vaccine efficacy that would allow drugmakers to conduct smaller, speedier human trials to get them to market and address a huge global vaccine shortage.
Researchers are trying to determine just what level of COVID-19 antibodies a vaccine must produce to provide protection against the illness. Regulators already use such benchmarks - known as correlates of protection - to evaluate flu vaccines without requiring large, lengthy clinical trials.
""You could use it to predict efficacy from a vaccine, which will be more important as we are less able to conduct placebo-controlled trials,"" said Stanley Plotkin, inventor of the Rubella vaccine and an expert on correlates of protection.
""The information is flowing in,"" he said. ""By the end of this year, I think there will be enough data to convince everyone.""An established benchmark for COVID-19 would allow drugmakers to conduct vaccine trials in just a few thousand people, about one-tenth the size of the studies conducted to gain authorization for currently widely-used coronavirus shots, researchers and drugmakers told Reuters. Those studies, involving tens of thousands of volunteers, compared the rate of COVID-19 infections in people who received the shot with the rate in participants who got a placebo. Such randomized, controlled trials may no longer be considered ethical in some countries, as researchers cannot give a dummy shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available. In addition, many of the new shots are being developed by small companies that may not be able to conduct very large trials without government funding or a partner with deep pockets. With an established correlate, drugmakers could test blood samples from a smaller number of trial participants who receive an experimental vaccine to see whether they produced that benchmark level of protective antibodies. 
Such a benchmark is “urgently needed” to help overcome challenges faced by vaccine developers and boost availability of shots, Dr. Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York wrote this month in the journal Nature. Researchers at Oxford University late last month proposed a potential correlate of protection based on antibodies found in people who had received the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine. The work awaits peer reviewed by other scientists. Results from a U.S.-backed study of Moderna’s vaccine are expected to be published in a medical journal later this summer. ""We're writing the paper right now,"" said Dr. Peter Gilbert, a biostatistician from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Some vaccine experts question whether antibody levels will be a strong enough indicator of protection. Other components of the immune system, such as T-cells and B-cells, are thought to provide important defenses against COVID-19, but are more difficult to measure. 
That has been the contention of some top vaccine experts at  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), maker along with BioNTech of one of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines, produced in the largest quantities globally. It is also possible that each different type of coronavirus vaccine will require its own correlate, some experts said. Drugmakers working on a new type of vaccine likely would not be able to rely on the correlates based on Moderna’s messenger RNA shot, they say.
BRIDGING THE GAP Meanwhile, vaccine developers are trying to devise acceptable substitutes to huge, placebo-controlled trials. Some aim to show their shot provokes antibody responses at least as good as those seen with currently authorized shots. European and UK health regulators are working with companies to set standards for these so-called “immunobridging” studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to say whether it would accept such trials for next-generation vaccines.
“It doesn't have to be an established correlate of protection, but we have to ... arrive at the right pre-specified criteria, because we cannot risk that a second-generation vaccine ... is of low or modest vaccine efficacy,"" FDA vaccine official Dr. Marion Gruber told fellow regulators at a World Health Organization Meeting in May. ""That would undermine confidence in the vaccine enterprise.""
Italy's ReiThera Srl is developing a vaccine using technology similar to AstraZeneca's and will try to demonstrate that its shot is at least as effective.
The company has an agreement in principle on trial design with European and British regulators, ReiThera's senior director Stefano Colloca told Reuters. Massive clinical trials are ""no longer ethical and feasible in most countries worldwide,"" he said. French biotech Valneva and Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp plan to test their vaccines against the AstraZeneca shot, even though both use a different technology. Valneva's trial design was approved by UK regulators. Medigen has a green light from Taiwan.
 Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY), with partner GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), and Canada’s Medicago are still opting for placebo-controlled trials involving thousands of participants, including in countries with high infection rates and fewer authorized vaccines available. 
NEED FOR BOOSTERS? The hunt for a correlate is underway from the UK to the United States and Australia. Scientists are comparing antibody levels in vaccinated people who became infected with COVID-19 to those who did not, to find a threshold of protection that made the difference. Oxford University researchers said work is needed to address correlates for emerging virus variants, such as the highly transmissible Delta that has quickly become dominant globally. Their proposed antibody model is based on trial volunteers who had mainly contracted the earlier Alpha variant, first identified in the UK. 
U.S. government-backed scientists are studying infections in people who received the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine. Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan said the company is also working on the analysis and will publish updates when available. The correlate benchmark might also indicate when and whether people need vaccine boosters.

Pfizer has sought authorization for a third booster dose of its vaccine, citing evidence of waning neutralizing antibody levels. But the company has pushed back against the idea that those same antibodies could be used to predict vaccine efficacy.
""No formal timeline is in place to have correlates of protection established,"" a Pfizer spokesperson said. ""We will continue to work with the scientific community to better understand what immune responses, whether neutralizing antibodies or otherwise, might contribute to protection.”

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>","Exclusive-How Didi's govt relations team navigated myriad regulators, until IPO dustup","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Didi Global successfully navigated China's regulatory thicket for years, but the ride-hailing giant's 200-plus government affairs team's reliance on personal contacts with officials left it partly exposed to a shock crackdown by Beijing, sources say.
    The government-relations firepower, which helped keep Didi on the road through safety scandals and lack of operating permits in many cities, failed to fully anticipate how dramatically the regulatory environment was changing as the company ploughed ahead with a $4.4 billion New York listing late last month.
As a result, when the powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) started a review into Didi's handling of customer data in the middle of its IPO campaign, many in the company believed the team would be able to ""convince"" watchdog officials, sources familiar with the matter said.
Just two days after its New York debut, the CAC announced an investigation into China's dominant ride-hailing company and subsequently ordered the removal of its apps for download in China.
    On Friday, Beijing announced that officials from at least seven departments, including the CAC, Ministry of Transport, and State Administration for Market Regulation (SMAR) were conducting an on-site cybersecurity review of Didi.
Didi, which said on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) that it accepts and will firmly comply with requests of relevant authorities to carry out review and rectification of problems, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
    Since late last year, China has moved with stunning speed to rein in the giants of its so-called platform economy, which had taken advantage of an often-permissive regulatory environment to achieve what state media has described as ""barbaric"" growth. 
    Didi became the biggest and most successful player in ride-hailing despite failing to be in full regulatory compliance in some of its China operations. 
    Two sources said only 20%-30% of Didi's business in China are fully compliant with regulations requiring three permits: one for the company to provide online ride-hailing services, a transportation permit for the vehicle and a license for the driver.
In June, the proportion of compliant vehicles among all the fleet taking orders on Didi platform was 30.7%, while driver compliance was at 45.2%, according to the Ministry of Transport.
In its IPO prospectus, Didi said it had obtained ride-hailing business permits for cities that collectively accounted for a majority of the total ride. It did not elaborate. 
    Didi has also managed to continue to operate in Shanghai without a platform permit and with many of its drivers not having the mandatory local hukou, or household registration permit, two separate sources said. 
Didi did not respond to queries about its Shanghai operations and business permits. Shanghai municipal government directed Reuters query to the transportation commission, which did not immediately respond.
All the sources declined to be named as they were not allowed to speak to the media.
Didi shares have tumbled 21% since their debut on June 30th, wiping off $14.2 billion in market value.
RELYING ON 'GUANXI'
Chinese tech firms stepped up hiring of compliance, legal and government-relations officials in the last few months as they braced themselves for Beijing's unprecedented clampdown on antitrust and customer data privacy violations.
The crackdown has put a spotlight on the role played by the government-relations teams in particular, which consist of former government officials, as they strive to grasp the regulatory directives that are not always formally communicated.
Didi and its government-relations (GR) team came under heavy scrutiny after two cases of rape and murder in 2018 involving the company's drivers.
""Since 2018, the GR team has become a super powerful team at Didi,"" said another person. ""Whenever the GR team has conflicts with other teams from the business side, it's usually the other teams that end up making concessions.""
In the run up to the IPO, the team came under pressure from senior management to fend off regulatory scrutiny and it, in turn, relied heavily on ""guanxi"", or personal relationships, said two of the sources.
The CAC, acutely aware of Didi's U.S. listing plan, had been looking into whether there is a possibility of some of the company's data ending up in the hands of a foreign entity given Beijing's sensitivity about usage of onshore data, said the sources.""What makes Didi more important than any other internet company is because Didi owns real-time data of each individual user's geographical position. You can identify a person's location simply using a mobile phone number,"" one of them said.

Didi, which has about 377 million annual active users and 13 million annual active drivers in China, provides 25 million rides a day in the country to users who sign up through an app that uses a phone number and password. 
Didi, backed by SoftBank, Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), also saves videos and recordings with in-vehicle cameras for at least seven days, which, the watchdog thinks, could be dangerous if leaked, another person said.

(Reuters) -Twitter Inc on Monday said it temporarily suspended Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for tweets which violated the social media's misinformation policy on COVID-19.
Greene posted that the coronavirus is not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65, and that organizations should not force ""non-FDA"" approved vaccines or masks. These tweets have been labeled as ""misleading"" by the platform.
The United States is using vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) under Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization. None of these vaccines are fully approved but numerous studies have proven their efficacy.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called on the social media companies to take action on vaccine misinformation.
""We took enforcement action on the account @mtgreenee for violations of the Twitter Rules, specifically the COVID-19 misleading information policy,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Greene's account will remain locked for 12 hours, according to Twitter.
In a video statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live, Greene acknowledged that she had been temporarily suspended from the platform and blamed the Biden administration for trying to control free speech.
""Remember, last week when our press secretary said the White House is working to stop the spread of (misinformation) because they want to be careful and they want to be in control of the information that is shared about COVID-19 and vaccines, isn’t that concerning?"" Greene said.

The Republican representative has come under fire before for remarks on the pandemic. In June she apologized after comparing COVID-19 mask requirements and vaccinations to the Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews.
In January, Twitter locked Greene's account after she sparred with a state election official over voter fraud allegations.

According to separate reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, J&J would pay $5 billion over nine years while McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have indicated in filings a likely pay out of $21 billion over 18 years.
The details of the settlement could be made Wednesday, a report by the news agency said.  
More than 40 states are likely to sign the deal while others are expected to move ahead with existing court cases already set for trial, Bloomberg said.
The agreement put behind a major overhang for companies seeking to end legal liabilities from their role in the opioid epidemic that gripped the country for more than two decades starting in 90s.
What began as a prescription in early 1990s for treating pain and alleviating the suffering of cancer patients grew to being widely given to patients with a much broader range of ailments. The prescriptions became more frequent, the dosage higher and illegal usage widespread.  
According to federal figures, the country lost nearly half a million people to overdoses of prescription and illegal opioids between 1999 and 2019.

(Reuters) - Three UK-listed drinks makers and sellers raised their financial targets on Tuesday betting on people stocking their fridges for the summer and soaring demand from bars and restaurants as they reopen after months of pandemic lockdowns.
Fevertree, which sells premium tonics and drink mixers, expects 2021 revenue to rise by as much as 21% compared to last year, while Irn-Bru maker A.G. Barr forecast profit for the year ending January 2022 to exceed pre-crisis levels.
Online wine retailer Virgin Wines, which was bought out from billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group, also upgraded its revenue and core earnings targets following strong demand over the past two months.
""We have seen nothing but encouraging signs over recent months that the customers we have acquired are staying loyal,"" its boss Jay Wright said.
Companies making and serving drinks are recouping some of their lost business from the past year when the health crisis shut down a major source of their income: the hospitality industry. That hit could not be fully offset by more people stocking up their bars at home with alcohol and mixers during lockdowns. 
Virgin Wines UK shares climbed 4% and A.G. Barr was little changed by 0757 GMT, while Fevertree slumped 6% after a warning that margins would narrow to 44% from 46.2% last year due to supply chain issues and higher input costs. 
""Whilst we anticipate some margin improvement next year, we believe logistic cost headwinds will continue alongside input cost increases on raw materials and product cost,"" Fevertree said.
J.P.Morgan analysts said Fevertree's caution may make some investors wary of the 2022 outlook. 
Sales to retail outlets, or off-trade, were strong across all its markets even as tap rooms reopened, Fevertree said. 

The company, whose tonic water comes in a range of flavours, lifted its revenue forecast for 2021 to between 295 million pounds ($402.91 million) and 304 million pounds. It reported 252.1 million pounds in revenue last year.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - SKF, the world's biggest maker of industrial bearings, forecast on Tuesday further sales growth in the third quarter after reporting earnings slightly above forecasts despite negative currency effects and rising costs.
SKF reported its organic net sales jumped by a third in the second quarter from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic a year earlier, helped by a strong recovery in demand from the auto industry. Its automotive business, which generates about 30% of overall sales, soared 75.9% while the industrial division, which accounts for 70% of sales, reported a 21.7% rise in sales.
The Swedish firm, which competes against Germany's Schaeffler said it expected an organic growth of around 10% in the third quarter compared with a year ago.
SKF reported second-quarter operating earnings of 2.88 billion Swedish crowns ($331.3 million), above the 2.81 billion forecast in a Refinitiv poll, and well above 669 million reported a year earlier.
""This is the strongest EBIT beat so far this quarter in the sector,"" investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note, noting that adjusted operating margin in the industrial division grew to 18% from 14% in the year-ago quarter. 
SKF shares, which were unchanged so far this year through Monday, were up 2.5% at 0703 GMT.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS on Tuesday posted a 63% jump in second-quarter net profit, easily beating expectations as buoyant markets continued to help the world's largest wealth manager generate higher earnings from managing money for the rich. 
The Swiss bank's net profit of $2.01 billion far outpaced expectations for $1.34 billion in a poll of 20 analysts compiled by the group, as fee income jumped and asset prices rose at its private bank and asset management business. 
""The momentum is on our side. We have no intention of letting go,"" Chief Executive Ralph Hamers told analysts on a call, adding across each region the bank had recorded its highest profit levels in more than five years.
""You can expect us to continue to focus on growth on the wealth side, but on efficiency as well (as we) continue to invest.""
UBS shares traded 4.6% higher shortly after market open, while the benchmark Swiss market index was up 1.0%. Analysts pointing to stronger-than-expected revenue across the board and ""well-contained costs"", as indicated by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in a note.
Hamers, in the top role since November, has set his sights on digitalisation to help win more business from the lower echelons of the world's well-off. UBS sees potential for a new online platform to pull in $30 billion in the next year after being launched in May 2020, Reuters reported in June.
That platform continued to see inflows through the second quarter, as a further $0.5 billion since early June brought its invested assets up to $4.2 billion.
On Tuesday, UBS posted $25 billion in fresh fee-generating client inflows throughout wealth management, thanks in particular to strong growth in the United States, where it is seeing rising business with the ultra-rich. Combined with strong markets, that helped push invested assets in its global wealth management business up by 4% sequentially to $3.2 trillion.
Trading amongst its wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients also remained strong, helping Switzerland's biggest bank boost pre-tax profits by 47% in its flagship business, as higher lending also helped offset a drag from lower interest rates on its net interest income.
MARKET VOLUMES DOWN
The first of the major European banks to report earnings, UBS has followed U.S. peers in smashing profit estimates. An economic recovery and a jump in dealmaking helped JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all hoist second-quarter profits.
But trading revenue took a hit, as lenders failed to match prior-year comparables, when unprecedented volatility during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic helped drive record volumes.
UBS, similarly, saw revenue drop 14% in its global markets trading business, though the fall was less pronounced than at some U.S. lenders. It flagged that lower trading volumes could continue into the current quarter. 
""We expect our revenues in the third quarter of 2021 to be influenced by seasonal factors, such as lower client activity levels compared with the second quarter of 2021,"" its outlook statement said. 
A surge in revenue from advising on deals helped offset the dip in markets earnings, pushing pretax profit at its investment bank up by 9% overall. Revenue from advising on mergers and acquisitions more than tripled in the second quarter, while in capital markets it was up 35%.
UBS in April reported an unexpected $774 million loss from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos, taking the total hit to global banks beyond $10 billion.
The Archegos default has had a much larger impact on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). UBS' cross-town rival has been under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan since suffering a more than $5 billion Archegos hit, hard on the heels of the $10 billion implosion in funds linked to supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
Credit Suisse reports earnings on July 29, following  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on July 28.

On Tuesday, UBS confirmed a further $87 million trading loss from the Archegos affair for the second quarter, as previously flagged. 
In Switzerland, UBS' domestic corporate and retail banking business saw pre-tax earnings double, helped by a pickup in economic activity as its home country eased COVID-related restrictions this year.

LONDON (Reuters) -The prospect of a bid battle for Morrisons lessened on Tuesday after one of the private equity group's stalking the British supermarket group said it would not pursue a solo offer.
U.S. group Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) said it was in talks to join the consortium led by Fortress Investment Group that last month agreed a 6.3 billion pound ($8.6 billion) takeover of Morrisons. 
Apollo, whose investments include Watches of Switzerland, TMT group Endemol Shine and bookmaker  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) Coral, said it did not intend to make an offer for Morrisons other than as part of the Fortress-led consortium.
Earlier this month Apollo had said it was evaluating its own bid. 
Shares in Morrisons were down 0.2% at 261.4 pence at 0723 GMT. Fortress' offer is pitched at 254 pence. 
The offer from Fortress, along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments, exceeded a 5.52 billion pound unsolicited proposal from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which Morrisons rejected in June.
CD&R could still come back with a higher offer, while analysts have speculated that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could also enter the fray.
Fortress is owned by Japan's SoftBank .
Morrisons is Britain's fourth largest supermarket group after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda.
Apollo said it had noted Fortress's intentions regarding the Morrisons business and all its stakeholders.
Fortress' assurances include retaining Morrisons' current management team and executing its existing strategy, keeping its head office in Bradford, northern England, and not selling stores.
""Should these discussions lead to any transaction, Apollo would be fully supportive of Fortress's stated intentions regarding Morrisons,"" Apollo said.
A circular from Morrisons detailing Fortress' offer must go to shareholders within 28 days of July 3.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses, helped by a strong quarterly update from Swiss banking giant UBS.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.1%.
Tuesday’s gains only partially recover some on Monday’s rout, when the DAX closing down 2.6%, the CAC 40 down 2.5% and the FTSE 100 2.3% lower, amid fears the latest surge of Covid-19 cases, led by the highly contagious delta variant, will prompt governments to resume tight lockdowns and curb economic activity.
These markets had rallied strongly in the first half of the year as investors bet that the rollout of Covid-19 vaccination programs would help economies to recover strongly as mobility restrictions were lifted. However, the increase in new cases, firstly in Asia but increasingly in Europe and the U.S., has changed that narrative.  
Helping the tone Tuesday was the news that UBS (SIX:UBSG) reported a 63% jump in quarterly net profit to $2 billion, up from the $1.23 billion reported for the same period last year, helped by what the Swiss wealth manager described as “favorable” market conditions. UBS stock rose over 4%.
EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock climbed 1.6% after the budget airline announced plans to fly 60% of its pre-pandemic capacity in the July-September period, a big jump from the 17% in the previous quarter, as travel appetite builds even as Covid cases rise again.
 Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) stock rose 0.8% after the French spirits group reported a more than doubling of sales in the first quarter, as bars and restaurants reopened in Europe while demand remained strong in China and the United States.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock rose 1.6% after the French luxury group agreed to buy a 60% stake in the streetwear brand Off-White.
On the flip side, Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) stock fell over 8% after the Swedish home appliances maker warned that supply chain issues would worsen this year, affecting output levels.
On the economic data front, German producer prices rose 8.5% on the year in June, at a 40-year high, and sure to provide food for thought for European Central Bank members when they meet on Thursday.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher Tuesday, steadying after the previous session’s sharp selloff on the back of worries that increased Covid cases will hit the short-term demand for energy just as a group of top producers agreed to increase supply.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $67.17 a barrel, after dropping more than 7% Monday, their worst session since September, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $69.54, after falling 6.8% to an eight-week low.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's AB Volvo warned on Tuesday of more production disruptions and stoppages this year after chip shortages prevented the truck maker from fully capitalising on strong demand for its vehicles in the second quarter.
Operating profit at the maker of trucks, construction equipment, buses and engines nearly tripled to 9.73 billion Swedish crowns ($1.12 billion) from 3.27 billion a year ago, but slightly missed the 9.84 billion seen by analysts according to Refinitiv data.
A global shortage of semiconductors just as the market roared back after last year's pandemic plunge has squeezed makers of heavy-duty trucks as well as smaller vehicles, crimping production, extending lead times and lifting costs.
Volvo, a rival of Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Traton, said it struggled with production stoppages of close to a month in the second quarter.
And while recovering strongly, the group's reported sales and adjusted earnings remained below cyclically-high levels reached over the same period in 2019, before the pandemic hit.
""There will be further disruptions and stoppages in both truck production and other parts of the group in the second half of the year,"" CEO Martin Lundstedt said in a statement.
Lundstedt said on a conference call that Volvo would seek to boost capacity in the second half, but cautioned supplies of components would set the limits. Volvo shares were down 3.9% by 0822 GMT.
""Volvo printed a good set of results, slightly below street estimates,"" analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a research note.
""With limited visibility in the supply chain and semi-conductor shortages still impacting the industry (in the second half), we expect limited movement in consensus expectations.""
Meanwhile, demand for heavy-duty trucks is strong with a surge in online shopping due to the pandemic driving freight volumes and rates and emboldening fleet operators to move ahead with vehicle orders suspended after the virus first struck.
Volvo said order bookings of its trucks, also sold under brands such as Mack and  Renault  (PA:RENA), soared 143% from a weak year-ago quarter and stood by forecasts for solid market growth in both Europe and North America this year.

The company also raised its 2021 outlook for construction equipment markets in both regions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd should be stripped of the gambling licence for its main Melbourne resort due to insufficient and uncertain efforts to reform its culture and stamp out money laundering, an inquiry heard on Tuesday.
The lawyer running the inquiry also expressed ""little confidence"" in the former Australian communications minister chairing the company and suggested it might take two years before it would be fit to run gambling operations.
The recommendations after months of hearings must still be considered by the federal court judge overseeing proceedings. If they are accepted, the company 37% owned by billionaire James Packer would see gambling stopped at the Melbourne city casino which generates three-quarters of its profit.
Shares in Crown, which is the target of two takeover approaches, fell as much as 3% by midafternoon, outpacing a broader market decline. 
""The programme of corporate rebirthing that Crown says is underway is insufficient and so uncertain as to lead this commission to the conclusion that there is a sufficiently clear pathway to suitability,"" said Adrian Finanzio, the lawyer hired by Victoria state to lead questioning.
A previous inquiry into a just-built A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Sydney resort found Crown unsuitable for a gambling licence in that city in February, and ""after the evidence listed in these hearings, it remains clear that Crown Melbourne is not fit to hold a licence now"", he added. 
The Sydney inquiry accused Crown of turning a blind eye to organised crime, allowing Packer of having an inappropriate level of control over decision making, and ignoring the safety of staff who were jailed in China for breaching that country's anti-gambling laws.
Under new chair Helen Coonan, Crown had proposed an ""impressive reform programme (but) on the most favourable estimates the reform programme will not be completed before the end of 2022"", Finanzio said at the hearing.
Crown said in a statement that it was ""carefully reviewing"" Finanzio's remarks before giving its own closing submission to the inquiry on Aug. 3.
Finanzio said Coonan must have contributed Crown's corporate governance problems since she joined the board in 2011, soon after leaving the Australian government.

""Ms Coonan's record as a director of Crown Resorts makes clear that her inaction in the past contributed to the problems"" and her actions since the Sydney inquiry ""give little confidence that she is the right person to shepherd the extent of change required"", he said.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>","China Evergrande shares, bonds slump as investor worries persist","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares and bonds of China Evergrande, the country's most indebted developer, stayed in the red on Tuesday as worries over its financial health persisted even after a local housing authority removed an earlier sales suspension at two real estate projects.
Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled as much as 19% to a fresh four-year low in morning trading, following Monday's 16% plunge, after the housing authority in Shaoyang city in south central Hunan province ordered a sales halt for the two residential projects.
The authority had ordered the suspension on suspicion over a misappropriation of funds, according to separate notices dated July 14. But in a reversal on Tuesday, it said the issue had been resolved and the two developments could resume sales.
Evergrande declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
As of 0650 GMT, Evergrande shares were down 9.1%, while its property management unit Evergrande Services rebounded to trade 2.2% firmer.
The sales halt had deepened worries that Evergrande, which owes roughly $90 billion by June, will struggle to pay its debts. News also emerged on Monday that a Chinese court had frozen one of Evergrande's bank accounts at the request of creditor China Guangfa Bank Co.
""Evergrande's external financing is restricted, so its debt repayment relies heavily on property sales,"" Everbright Securities analyst Zhang Xu wrote in a report on Tuesday.
But revenue generation is challenging for Evergrande, whose real estate projects for sale are mostly located in China's third- and fourth-tier cities, Zhang added. 
Pessimism is spilling into the broader property sector, as China kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at its July fixing on Tuesday, dashing hopes for a cut after a surprise lowering of bank reserve requirements last week.
China's CSI300 real estate index was down 0.1% on Tuesday afternoon, following Monday's 1.9% slump.
Although China has eased monetary policy slightly to help smaller companies and avert systemic risks, there will be sustained curbs on liquidity flowing into the property sector, said Cheng Hao, Shanghai-based fund manager at Fidelity International.
VICIOUS CYCLE 
Wonnie Chu, managing director at GaoTeng Global Asset Management, said that surging bond yields for a developer risked creating a ""vicious cycle"" that could damage refinancing capabilities.
A Shanghai-traded Evergrande bond closed 6% lower on Tuesday at 64.7 yuan versus its face value of 100 yuan, after recouping some losses. An Evergrande bond maturing in January 2023 ended down 5% in Shenzhen, at 74.9 yuan. Bond prices move inversely to yields.
Chinese developers are struggling with slower sales and rising financing costs as Beijing restricts property loans and imposes policies under the ""three red lines"" guidance to force deleveraging in the sector. 
""The housing situation in China is quite political because it becomes an affordability issue and a matter of social cohesion,"" said Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee.
The government will continue to keep curbs in place, ""so we are going to see more defaults"". 

Last week, Chinese real estate developer Sichuan Languang Development said it had overdue debts totalling 4.54 billion yuan.
China Fortune Land Development Co, which defaulted earlier this year, said on Tuesday that its overdue debts had increased to 73.2 billion yuan.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Oil Search (OTC:OISHY) rejected an unsolicited takeover proposal from Santos Ltd valuing the Papua New Guinea-focused oil and gas producer at A$8.8 billion ($6.5 billion), but both companies said on Tuesday they wanted to pursue further talks.
Oil Search said the offer was not in the best interests of shareholders, but its shares rose 8% after both companies said it made sense to create a group that would rival Australia's top independent gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum in market value.
""Oil Search agrees with Santos that there is strategic logic in a combination of the two companies,"" Oil Search said in a statement, but added that Santos had yet to come back with a fair offer.
The approach comes at a vulnerable time for Oil Search as it is searching for a new chief executive to replace Keiran Wulff, who quit on Monday following just 17 months in the job due to ill health and following a whistleblower complaint. It also just put on hold a final decision on a $3 billion oil project in Alaska.
Santos made the approach on June 25, but the proposal was only revealed on Tuesday after Oil Search Chairman Rick Lee a day earlier, on a call about Wulff's resignation, told analysts the company had not received any approaches.
Santos said it proposed to offer 0.589 new Santos shares for each Oil Search share held. Based on Santos' closing share price on June 24, that was worth A$4.25 per Oil Search share, a 12% premium to Oil Search's share price at the time.
""Santos continues to believe that the merger proposal represents an extremely attractive opportunity to deliver compelling value accretion to both Santos and Oil Search shareholders,"" Santos said in a statement.
Oil Search shares were up 7% at A$3.93 in afternoon trade in a broader market that was trading lower. Santos shares were down 4%.
""The bid comes at a pretty opportune time (for Santos), but it's unlikely to get up at that level of premium,"" said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, which holds shares in both Santos and Oil Search.
Oil Search's former top shareholder, Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala, sold nearly half its 9.5% stake in Oil Search for A$3.865 a share in June, just before Santos made its takeover approach. 
Santos declined to say whether it bought any of Mubadala's shares.
A takeover of Oil Search would give Santos a bigger stake in the  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Corp-led PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea, considered one of the world's lowest cost liquefied natural gas producers, and give it a stake in the Papua LNG project, on track to be developed by TotalEnergies.
Santos would also become operator of the Pikka oil project in Alaska.
Santos, advised by Citi and JB North & Co, said it has sought to engage the Oil Search board on the rationale for merging. Oil Search is being advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Macquarie Capital.

Oil Search rejected an $8 billion all-share takeover plan from Woodside in 2015.

A city housing authority in Hunan province ordered two Evergrande developments to suspend sales on suspicion over a misappropriation of funds, according to separate notices dated July 14. The amount from sales deposited officially was less than total actual sales of 528 million yuan ($81.40 million) recorded so far this year, the statement said.
The statements said Evergrande's project companies have not taken measures to correct the situation despite multiple notices, so the authorities decided to suspend the sales in the two developments in Shaoyang city until Oct 13.
Evergrande declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Shares and bonds of Evergrande and its subsidiaries extended their sharp declines on Tuesday following news the previous day that a Chinese court had ordered a freeze on a $20.4 million bank deposit at the request of China Guangfa Bank Co, though the property firm said the loan was not due until March.
Evergrande shares dropped as much as 16% on Tuesday morning, falling to their lowest since March 2017, while its exchange-traded 6.98% January 2023 bond sank nearly 14% in Shenzhen. 

Investor concerns over Evergrande's liquidity have risen in recent weeks after the firm said in June that some of its project companies' commercial debt had not been repaid on time, but it was arranging payments.

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said on Tuesday it voted against 10% of company directors this year, up from 8.5% last year, as part of a more muscular approach to corporate governance.
BlackRock gave the breakdown in its quarterly stewardship report, citing issues like a lack of boardroom diversity or director independence. 
The New York-based company also confirmed it did not support management on 35% of shareholder resolutions this year, about twice its rate in 2020, and did not support management on nearly two-thirds of environmental proposals, up from 11% the previous year. That helped drive support for climate and social issues to new heights at springtime shareholder meetings.[L2N2NL2O2]
The figures show a new and more critical process by the company's stewardship chief, Sandy Boss. She took over last year as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down economies worldwide and clients focused on issues like inequality and the environment.
""We’ve made adjustments in our approach,"" Boss said in an interview, noting that executives are often more responsive as they factor in the costs of climate change.
""It’s like any financial situation, once you see something big looming, finance tends to present-value it forward,"" Boss said.
BlackRock, the influential manager of more than $9 trillion, said it voted on more than 64,000 director elections in the 12 months ended June 30 and cast 6,550 critical votes. 
In Asia, BlackRock said many independent directors have served ""an excessive period,"" while in the United States a lack of boardroom gender diversity often brought its disapproval.

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, compensation most often drove critical board votes. BlackRock also said it voted against 33% of executive pay proposals in that region, up from 26% in 2020, often related to ""in-flight adjustments"" to boost executive pay even if they missed performance targets.
Its support for U.S. ""Say on Pay"" votes, in which shareholders weigh in on executive pay, remained at 95% for 2021, BlackRock said.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.58% by 10:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day said Japan’s national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.2% year-on-year in June, while national CPI growth remained unchanged at 0.3% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.51%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.18%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest policy meeting earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.41%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.74% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.06%. Geopolitical tensions also rose after the U.S., the U.K. and their allies accused China of being the mastermind behind a series of malicious ransomware, data theft and cyber-espionage attacks against public and private entities, including a hack on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Exchange hack earlier in the year.
The People's Bank of China also kept its July loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged, with the one-year LPR at 3.85% and the five-year LPR at 4.65%. The LPRs’ release comes after the central bank sprung a surprise cut in the reserve ratio requirement earlier in the month.
In other central bank news, the European Central Bank and Bank Indonesia will hand down their respective policy decision on Thursday.
U.S. shares recorded small gains after the S&P 500 saw their biggest drop in two months, thanks to a reversal of the reopening trade where cyclicals like energy and financial shares slid.
Long-term U.S. Treasury rates rose, after falling to their lowest level since February 2021 on Monday and flattening the yield curve. Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year yields climbed back above the 1.2% mark.
Investors are also calculating how long the volatility driven by COVID-19 outbreaks will last, with retail investors buying dips in stocks becoming a familiar trend.
Outbreaks continue in places ranging from Australia to Indonesia to the U.K., with the U.S. warning its citizens to avoid traveling to the latter as the number of daily cases continues to rise.
“One of the reasons bonds have rallied so much is that institutional investors have rebalanced out of equities, which have had a huge run, into fixed income,”  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Bank chief investment strategist Jim McDonald told Bloomberg.
“The recent weakness is justified on a short-term basis. If you look at the issue with the Delta variant and COVID-19, it is a short-term concern, but if you look out to the end of 2021 most of the Western economies will have immunity in the 75% to 80% range,” he added.
Investors are also keeping an eye on inflation, with U.S. President Joe Biden adding his voice to assurances that inflationary pressures will be temporary.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Tighter requirements to stay on the Tokyo bourse's prestigious main board are forcing Japanese companies to cease long criticised practices such as cash-hoarding and cross shareholdings, even as some investors call for tougher reform.
In the biggest overhaul of Japan's stock markets in a decade, Tokyo Stock Exchange will introduce next year tighter listing criteria for the top category, which 30% of almost 2,200 companies listed on its main section currently do not meet.
The reform is meant to create a higher profile for firms with global corporate governance and profitability standards as well as disclosures in English for the main board to attract foreign investment, a policy drive that began under the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Stricter rules for liquidity - market capitalisation in tradable shares of at least 10 billion yen ($90 million) with a tradable share ratio of 35% or more - are especially tough for small caps firms or those largely owned by parent companies or business partners. 
Many small cap firms ""previously had little urgency to increase share prices, but the new rules are having a huge impact on their mindset,"" said Atsuko Furuta, director at investor relations consulting firm IR Japan.
Road construction machinery maker Sakai Heavy Industries Ltd last month vowed to stay on the main board, launching share buybacks and setting its dividend payout ratio target at 50%. Shares have surged by over 20% since the announcements.
""All we can do to meet the market cap requirement is to raise share prices,"" executive officer Takao Yoshikawa told Reuters. ""We now plan to return capital in excess to shareholders instead of hoarding it to boost return on equity, a gauge that investors care about.""
Similarly, chemicals trading firm Soda Nikka Co announced its largest-ever share buybacks and pledged to raise its payout ratio target to 40% from 30%. 
For many, being listed on the TSE's first section, to be renamed ""prime market"" in April, is a status symbol. 
""The first section status means our creditworthiness to clients, lenders and new hires,"" Hideo Tanaka, CEO of realtor A.D. Works Group Co told a media briefing. ""We must do whatever it takes to be on the prime market.""
The tradable share ratio rule also affects some larger firms, prompting them to unwind cross-shareholding, where firms hold stakes in each other to cement business ties.
The longstanding practice has been criticised as creating a cozy relationship between management and large shareholders, though the percentage of such shareholdings have halved to less than 15% in two decades, according data from Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research.
Automotive components maker  Toyota  Boshoku Corp asked Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to release part of its stake to meet the 35% target, while foods wholesaler Mitsubishi Shokuhin Co launched a tender offer to buy back some of its shares owned by trading firm Mitsubishi Corp.
""WASTED OPPORTUNITY""
TSE says the overhaul is designed to bring clear concepts for each market segment, designating the prime market to companies that can have ""constructive dialogue with global investors."" 
""It's been said that for some companies, listing on the first section has been their final goal and they make no efforts to improve once that's achieved,"" Hiromi Yamaji, the head of the bourse, told Reuters this month.
But some investors said the new criteria are still too lax to make much impact, noting the reform's initial ambition was to narrow down to some top 500 firms for TSE's Topix index, which currently includes all the companies listed on the main board.
""The S&P 500 index for example is far more selective, while the prime market will likely allow firms with governance concerns,"" said Taku Ito, chief portfolio manager at Nissay Asset Management. ""This is an opportunity wasted.""
Companies that fail to meet the new rules can still apply to remain on the prime market for an unspecified transition period by submitting improvement plans by December, another point that some investors say waters down reforms.

If those not meeting the criteria remain listed on the prime market indefinitely, ""the reform will be meaningless,"" said Atsushi Kamio, senior researcher at the Daiwa Institute of Research.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in Delta variant infections sparked a broad sell-off on Wall Street on Monday as investors feared renewed COVID-19 shutdowns and a protracted economic recovery.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session sharply lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq suffering their largest one-day percentage drop since mid-May.
The blue-chip Dow had its worst day in nearly nine months.
The risk-off sentiment also sent U.S. 10-year Treasury yields sliding, pulling rate sensitive banks stock prices with them. The S&P 500 Banks index dropped 3.3%.
""Much of it is related to the Delta (variant),"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There’s some concern too that maybe the economy is not going to open up as quickly as everyone thinks, and the big boom that everyone’s expecting is going to be more of a pop than a boom."" 
The highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, now the dominant strain across the globe, has caused a surge in new infections and deaths, nearly exclusively among unvaccinated people.

""Global availability of the vaccine has been an issue from day one."" Nolte said. ""That’s been out there for a long time. This is the latest iteration of that. We still have a long way to go.""
Travel and leisure stocks plunged, with the S&P 1500 Airline index shedding 3.8% and the S&P 1500 Hotel and Restaurant index off 2.7%.
The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, gained 4.1 points to 22.50, its highest closing level in two months.

Analysts now see year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 72% for the April to June period, substantially higher than the 54% annual growth forecast at the beginning of the quarter, per Refinitiv. 
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp beat quarterly revenue estimates based on the strength of its cloud computing segment. Its shares were up over 3% in after-hours trading.

The source said the testing program for employees would resume if there were any changes in public health guidance from local or national officials. 
Coronavirus cases in the United States are rising rapidly as the highly contagious Delta variant takes hold and vaccinations lag in several states.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>","Leon Black rejects Russian woman's claims of violent behavior, files countersuit","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black, the billionaire who until recently led private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, on Monday strongly rejected claims by a Russian model who accused him of defamation and subjecting her to sexual violence, calling her accusations ""a work of fiction.""
Black also filed his own defamation lawsuit accusing the woman, Guzel Ganieva, of running a ""blatant"" scheme to extort him of at least $100 million in exchange for keeping quiet. 
Ganieva's lawsuit and Black's countersuit in a New York state court in Manhattan seek unspecified damages.
""Right out of the defense playbook, Black's counterclaims are an obvious effort at intimidating Ms. Ganieva who will continue to aggressively litigate her claims and hold Black accountable for his heinous conduct,"" Ganieva's lawyer Jeanne Christensen said in an emailed statement.
Black, 69, stepped down as Apollo's chief executive and chairman this year after an independent review by the Dechert law firm said he paid the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning.
The review found Black was not involved with Epstein's criminal activities. Black said at the time he deeply regretted his involvement with Epstein.
In her June 1 lawsuit, Ganieva accused Black of lying by denying claims she made on Twitter that he ""sexually harassed and abused"" her ""for years,"" when he later told media he had ""foolishly had a consensual affair"" with her and that she extorted him.
Ganieva also said Black subjected her to numerous instances of unwanted sexual conduct, including an alleged July 2014 rape in her apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
In Monday's filings, Black's lawyers said Ganieva's complaint was ""rife"" with accusations that were ""scandalous, prejudicial, irrelevant, and intended only to feed breathless tabloid headlines and destroy Mr. Black's reputation.""
They asked a judge to strike dozens of excerpts, including that Black ""derived pleasure"" from humiliating and debasing Ganieva, and by accusing her of extortion borrowed ""the playbook of scores of wealthy and powerful men"" facing similar accusations.
Black's lawyers also rejected Ganieva's rape claim, calling the encounter a ""pre-planned romantic evening"" where he showed up with a bottle of wine and tucked her into bed.
""The complaint in this case is a work of fiction,"" the lawyers said.
Ganieva, in her late 30s, said Black picked her out of a crowd at a 2008 International Women's Day event, and later accompanied her to top restaurants, cultural events and parties.
Black's lawyers said the first meeting was at a private party, and that Black's subsequent 6-1/2-year relationship with Ganieva was ""casual, episodic, and completely consensual.""

The lawyers said that after Ganieva began what they allege was her extortion campaign, Black agreed in October 2015 to pay her $100,000 a month for 15 years. They said the payments stopped after Ganieva posted her tweets in March.
""Mr. Black is guilty only of extremely poor judgment"" by having an affair with Ganieva, making himself a target by lavishing her with gifts and money, and allowing himself to be extorted, his lawyers said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Stocks on Wall Street fell as much as 2% on Monday, with the Dow posting its worst day in nine months, as a rise in worldwide coronavirus cases and increasing U.S. deaths drove investors out of risky assets, crushing bond yields and share prices.
Oil prices plunged more than 6%, driven down both by worries about future demand and by an OPEC+ agreement to increase supply.
U.S. Treasury bond yields tumbled to five-month lows, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes sinking 12.2 basis points to 1.177%, close to the session's low of 1.176%, a level last seen in February.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended trading sharply lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq suffering their largest one-day percentage falls since mid-May. 
Rising COVID-19 cases, spurred by the Delta variant, fueled fears of a resurgence, with the average number of infections per day tripling in the past 30 days in the United States, according to an analysis of Reuters data. 
Deaths, which can lag weeks behind a rise in cases, rose 25% last week from the previous seven days with an average of 250 people dying a day.
""The markets suffered a summer swoon today with COVID fears again at the forefront of investors' minds,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
""Despite the negative tone weighing on markets, we remain optimistic that the economy is on a strong footing and, although the path will be uneven, the trend is still toward increasing growth and higher corporate profits.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 725.81 points, or 2.09%, to 33,962.04, the S&P 500 lost 68.67 points, or 1.59%, to 4,258.49 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 152.25 points, or 1.06%, to 14,274.98.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.63%.
Investors are also worried about the specter of elevated inflation, which the market has long feared.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday acknowledged that prices for some items such as vehicles have increased but said that his administration would remain vigilant over inflation and the havoc it could wreak on the economy.
""Fear of stagflation will be a major concern for investors if a resurgence in COVID infections causes economies to slow while consumer prices continue an upward trajectory,"" said Peter Essele, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, in an e-mailed statement. 
COVID-19 outbreaks are occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. About one in five new cases is in Florida, and the vast majority of people hospitalized for COVID are unvaccinated. 
""The big concern for the market is whether we are going to see a slowdown in the global economic recovery, and this could be the overriding force which results in a bad period for equities in the weeks ahead,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at brokerage AJ Bell.
Travel and leisure stocks sank, with the S&P 1500 Airline index shedding 3.8% and the S&P 1500 Hotel and Restaurant index off 2.7%.
The greenback climbed to a more than three-month peak against a basket of major currencies. But the dollar is off highs as the yen and Swiss franc advanced with the decline in risk appetite.
FOREVER CHANGED?
Oil prices fell as OPEC+ agreed to boost output, causing concerns about a crude surplus if an economic slowdown comes to pass. The decline was the largest since late March.[O/R]
U.S. crude recently fell 7.39% to $66.50 per barrel and Brent was at $68.65, down 6.71% on the day.

Economists at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) downgraded their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 6.5%, from 7% previously.

Scoop Up These 4 Stocks,"OPEC+’s announcement regarding the easing of supply restrictions beginning in August has caused a slump in oil prices since yesterday. However, given strong demand and declining inventories, analysts expect oil prices to rebound soon. Thus, we think investors should scoop up the stocks of EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG),  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), and Apache (APA) on the price dip to benefit from a potential oil-price rebound soon.After a prolonged disagreement among OPEC+ members regarding oil supply restrictions, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reached an accord over the weekend to boost production by 400,000 barrels per day beginning in August. Following news of the agreement, the front-month West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude contracts witnessed their largest single-session percentage decline since March. Oil prices are currently hovering near $70 per barrel.
However, the baseline restrictions on oil production are expected to be lifted in May next year, as announced by OPEC+. Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said, “WTI crude’s fundamentals still support another massive move higher.”
Thus, oil prices are poised to make a strong rebound as demand rises in tandem with the economic recovery in developing regions. Thus, investors could capitalize on the dip in prominent oil stocks EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), Energy Transfer LP (ET), Continental Resources, Inc.

The company's shares were up 2% at $140.73 in extended trading.
""With the reopening (of economies) in particular around North America and Western Europe, we're seeing a nice rebound in travel and transportation, automotive, industrial and consumer sectors overall,""  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters, adding that more clients spent on digitizing their operations.
After the pandemic battered existing models of business, more enterprises are adopting ""hybrid cloud"", a combination of using their own data centers and leased computing resources to manage and process data.

Read on.Cloud computing has been in the limelight since last year, aided by the worldwide adoption of remote working and learning. The significant increase in employee productivity and relatively lower overhead costs delivered by remote working structures have incentivized major businesses to adapt to these structures, which are underpinned by cloud computing technologies. A recent CNBC survey revealed that 45% of the companies are planning to adopt a hybrid working model in the second half of 2021.
Furthermore, the threatening Delta variant of COVID-19 is expected to further delay the reopening of offices, keeping fully remote or hybrid working structures as the norm in the coming months. This, coupled with the gradual 5G rollout, should drive spending on cloud services.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",Bill Ackman rejigs Universal deal after regulators probe SPAC plan,"PARIS (Reuters) -Billionaire investor Bill Ackman will buy up to 10% of Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY)'s Universal Music Group through his main hedge fund, rather than a special purpose acquisition company, after investors and regulators questioned his use of a SPAC. 
The investment comes ahead of a plan to list and spin off 60% of Universal to Vivendi shareholders, as the French group, controlled by tycoon Vincent Bollore, cashes in on the streaming boom and the lure of stars such as Taylor Swift.
The transaction has attracted big investors, including China's Tencent (HK:0700). But Ackman's decision to use a SPAC to buy a minority stake raised eyebrows from the start, after deviating from the usual investment pattern for such vehicles. 
Helped by easy monetary conditions, Wall Street and European markets have experienced a boom in these so-called blank cheque companies, designed to snap up entire private firms and take them public without the more onerous rules attached to listings. 
Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH), Ackman's SPAC, said in a statement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had raised issues with several elements of the deal, without disclosing them. 
""The SEC raised a deal killer. They said that, in their view, the transaction did not meet the New York Stock Exchange SPAC rules and what that meant was what I would call a dagger in the heart of the transaction,"" Ackman told CNBC in an interview.
Some investors had also queried the transaction, with PSTH shares falling 18% since it was announced, despite Universal's appeal. Ackman had described Universal as an ""incredibly iconic, super durable business"", and his investment had valued the music label group at 35 billion euros ($41 billion), including debt. 
""We underestimated the reaction that some of our shareholders would have to the transaction's complexity and structure,"" Ackman said in a PSTH statement. 
Pershing Square, Ackman's main hedge fund, will now replace PSTH as the investor. 
""Our counterparty was not left at the altar,"" Ackman added.
The overhaul is a blow to the biggest-ever SPAC, after PSTH raised $4 billion in an initial public offering last summer. It said it now had 18 months to find another target, or it must return funds to its investors. 
Ackman was optimistic he would find a new target, noting that many of the companies with which he had preliminary conversations a year ago might now be more ready to consider the next step.
Amid the SPAC deal frenzy, the SEC has begun to probe several aspects of the vehicles, including the way they are marketed and project growth forecasts, and potential conflicts of interest among their advisers. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said the $4 billion Universal investment would be a big outlay for Ackman's main Pershing Square fund, but could be co-financed. 
Ackman has revealed a personal motivation for supporting Universal, linked to his songwriting grandfather, Herman Ackman, who sold lyrics that are now owned by the music group.

Vivendi said in a separate statement that Pershing Square's investment would likely amount to between 5% and 10% of Universal's capital, adding that it would open it up to other investors to make up the shortfall were it less than 10%.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 plunged Monday as sharp fall in yields signaled fresh fears about the growth outlook at time when the Delta variant continues to spread.
The S&P 500 fell 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.5%, or 852 points, the Nasdaq was down 1.4%.
""A plethora of macro uncertainty is now in investor crosshairs including pandemic / variant spread; reflation / inflation; future of CB policy; earnings; and geopolitical tensions (watch the ongoing escalation between U.S. & allies against China),"" Mark Luschini, chief Investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
New coronavirus cases climbed in all 50 states on Sunday for the fourth day in a row on a rolling seven-day average, a rise not seen since the spring 2020 surge, Stifel said, citing Johns Hopkins University data.
This backdrop of worries has muddied the outlook for growth, prompting a sharp decline in Treasury yields, and pressuring cyclical stocks including financials and energy.

Investing.com -- Worries about a surge in cases linked to the super-contagious Delta variant of coronavirus sent stocks on their worst ride since last October, with the three major indexes plunging.
Though earnings season got off to a good start last week, it wasn’t enough to quiet investor fears about a possible interruption to the economic rebound, as Covid cases spike in the United States to levels not seen since mid-May, and hospitalizations and deaths are also rising.
Though many of the newest cases are being associated with areas of the country where vaccination rates are low, there are still concerns that even fully vaccinated people can contract or spread the virus. 
The professional association of pediatric doctors on Monday recommended U.S. school children wear masks in school this fall, regardless of vaccine status, contradicting some of the guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Adding to Monday’s angst was a bullish agreement by members of the international oil cartel, which managed to put aside its differences over the weekend and agree to add oil production starting next month and building through next year until all the production cuts put in place during the pandemic are reversed.
Oil prices, which had been rising this year, tumbled more than 7% on Monday, though some expect they will eventually rebound if demand isn’t dented by a surge in Covid cases shutting businesses down again.
Earnings season continues this week. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Streaming giant
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is expected to report second-quarter earnings per share of $3.18 on $7.32 billion revenue, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. At-home streaming and entertainment was a clear winner of the pandemic’s stay at home lifestyle, but analysts will be listening to hear Netflix’s outlook for the rest of this year.
2. Burrito profits
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) is seen posting EPS of $6.50 on revenue of $1.88 billion in the second quarter. The popular burrito chain spent the pandemic building new ways to reach hungry customers, including digital sales and drive-thru lanes. Now that people are returning to restaurants themselves, analysts expect to see strong growth across all channels.
3. Good news, bad news
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) is expected to clock a per-share loss of $4.21 on $5.25 billion in second-quarter revenue. A surge in travel demand this spring is now threatened by rising Covid cases around the world, sending shares of airlines down on Monday along with other travel related stocks.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 03:38PM ET</span>",Exxon Mobil adds first woman top-tier executive with external CFO hire,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault, Sabrina Valle and Devika Krishna Kumar
(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp's new chief financial officer Kathyrn Mikells is the first woman and external hire to join the oil major's management committee, as energy firms search to diversify their workforce in response to investor pressure.
Exxon has faced pressure from investors to shake up its leadership in the executive suite and its board of directors after years of poor returns and as other global oil majors invest more heavily in the energy transition. 
Mikells is the first woman and first external hire to enter Exxon's uppermost echelon. Up until now, its cadre of senior vice presidents has remained dominantly male and internally sourced, with all four members of the current management committee having spent two decades or more with the company, according to its website. 
""We welcome Kathy to  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and look forward to the perspective and experience she brings as we work together to deliver on our strategies and increase shareholder value,"" Chief Executive Darren Woods said in Monday's release. 
Mikells is Exxon's first major hire since outside investors led a board shakeup earlier this year. In that move, activist investor Engine No. 1 claimed several board seats, including one for former Andeavor CEO Greg Goff, known for restructuring companies. Exxon declined to comment further on its diversity strategy for its executive committee.
""This is clearly a first move for what will be a change in management and tone,"" said analyst Paul Sankey in New York. ""The history of the company has been a rigid hierarchical matter. This is the kind of unprecedented move we expected from the board change that has occurred."" 
In the past decade, more women have risen to top ranks of the energy industry: Lynn Good serves as CEO of utility  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK), Vicki Hollub became CEO of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) in 2016 and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX)'s former CFO Pat Yarrington was one of the first women in the top tier of a publicly-traded major oil company, serving as CFO from 2009 until her retirement in 2019. 
Mikells, who joins effective Aug. 9, will replace Andrew Swiger, the company's principal financial officer, who joined Exxon in 1978 and is now at retirement age, the company said in a statement. 
Mikells previously worked at spirit distributer  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc and United Airlines (O:UAL), where she was responsible for the airline's fuel hedging strategy, and also served as assistant restructuring officer. 

While Exxon has female leaders, the top tier management committee, comprised of the CEO and three to four senior vice presidents has remained all-male according to a Reuters' review of SEC filings dating to 2001. The company's preference for promoting from the inside was chronicled in Steve Coll's 2013 book, describing the company's 20,000-square foot (1,900-square meters) executive wing as the ""God Pod.""
Across energy companies, women's employment lags other sectors, accounting for only 19% of the energy sector's workforce, according to a study from Accenture (NYSE:ACN) released last month. By comparison, the overall U.S. workforce is 47% female, the study found.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 03:37PM ET</span>","A scandal cost Brazil billionaire bank CEO his job, but not control","By Tatiana Bautzer, Carolina Mandl and Jessica DiNapoli
SAO PAULO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twenty-three days in a Rio de Janeiro jail and getting stripped of his chief executive role were enough to make billionaire banker Andre Esteves consider leaving both Brazil and BTG Pactual, the investment bank he founded.
Six years later, Esteves, whose stake in the bank is worth roughly 40 billion reais ($7.89 billion), is closing in on a comeback, four sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. 
Far from quitting, the sources said Esteves has increasingly controlled key decisions at the bank even though he has no formal management role there, fashioning the publicly held BTG after  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) in its days as a private partnership.
The Esteves revival gained strength after he was first exonerated in one of Brazil's ""Car Wash"" corruption inquiries in July 2018. He has now put most of his other legal troubles behind him, and could get final regulatory approvals soon to rebuild his controlling stake at BTG. 
In the two years since Brazilian regulators allowed him to rejoin a group of partners known as the ""G7"", which holds a majority stake in BTG but is different from the board, Esteves has overseen a push into retail banking, led negotiations on two acquisitions and worked directly with clients on initial public offerings and other deals, the sources said. 
The departure of some partners at the bank, including former co-Chief Executive Marcelo Kalim, were because they either resisted his return or disagreed with his strategic push, the sources said. 
Kalim, who left in December 2018 to found his own online bank, declined to comment on the circumstances of his exit.
While the bank’s shares have risen by 130% over the past two years, some corporate governance specialists say Esteves' control over strategic decisions as a shareholder without any management role is troubling. It reflects poorly on the bank's board as well as the overall standards in Latin America’s largest economy, they said. 
Francisco Reyes Villamizar, an expert on Latin American corporate law and a visiting professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, said the board should be asking questions about what Esteves' role at the bank is. “They become tolerant of this kind of behavior and that’s when things go wrong,” Villamizar said.
BTG's board has come under pressure. Proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis recommended in April to vote against some of the directors and said the board had fewer independent directors than the company claimed. One large shareholder, Norway's Norges Bank, followed the advice and has been voting against some nominees over the last few years alleging lack of independence.
BTG defended its corporate governance arrangements, however. “About 70% of the company is owned by its managing partners, which brings unprecedented long-term alignment of interest with its shareholders,"" it said. The bank rejected the contention of proxy advisory firms, and said it had four independent directors on the board.
Esteves, too, is comfortable assuming control because he owns about 25% of BTG's total capital and, as a major shareholder regulated by Brazil's central bank, he can be held accountable if anything goes wrong, a person familiar with his thinking said.
He has no plans to take on a formal management role or become chairman of the bank because ""everyone"" knows him as the person in charge, including BTG's public investors, the person added.
The U.S. Federal Reserve recently signed off on Esteves request to regain a controlling stake, while Brazil's central bank approved it in late 2019. The final piece of the jigsaw, approval from the European Central Bank to allow Esteves to regain his 61.55% voting stake in G7, could come within weeks, two sources close to the group said.
The ECB and the Fed declined to comment. 
(For a GRAPHIC about BTG's assets, click https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gYEE5/4)
'WITCH HUNT' Esteves has told friends and clients that his arrest in 2015 was ""absurd"" and part of a ""witch hunt,"" based on a politician's false allegations. Former congressman Delcidio Amaral had accused the banker of offering to pay off witnesses in the Car Wash probe to prevent them from striking plea bargain deals. Amaral later retracted his deposition, admitting he was not sure about any offer by Esteves to pay witnesses and saying he had just ""heard"" about it.
BTG shares tumbled 21% on the day of his arrest and extended losses to roughly 50% in the first month following it. Facing a liquidity crunch, BTG took a loan from Brazil's deposit insurance body and sold assets.
The bank eventually raised enough cash to pay troves of investors who rushed to redeem deposits. It also repaid early the loans from the Deposit Insurance Fund. The 53-year-old Carioca, as Rio natives are known, spent the first four months after his release from jail under house arrest. 
The reappearance of the man who joined Banco Pactual as an intern in 1989 was resisted by former chairman Persio Arida and other partners worried about the potential effect on the bank's reputation, two of the sources said.
Arida, who left the bank in 2017, declined to comment.
Marcelo Kalim, the BTG partner with the second-biggest ownership stake who had become co-CEO after the arrest and who wanted to establish a full-service retail digital bank, clashed with Esteves over strategy, according to two sources. 
Esteves wanted to launch a digital broker solely to develop the bank's existing wealth management business. When co-CEO Roberto Sallouti sided with him, Kalim quit. 
Esteves believes it is natural for some partners to leave the bank, according to the person familiar with his thinking.
OWNERS LIKE SAFRA 
Now, Esteves is present at most meetings on BTG's retail banking strategy, with or without Sallouti, and has led roadshows for two BTG share offerings, two of the sources said.
In the latest, he told investors that he hoped to roughly triple the funding BTG gets from retail to 40%, one source said.
To take on Brazil's big banks in retail, Esteves wants to target a separate demographic with its Banco Pan unit by catering to low income clients seeking credit and BTG+, its digital banking arm, serving those on high incomes and competing more directly with rivals such as Itau Unibanco, according to a person familiar with his thinking.
Should it need more cash to fund its retail expansion, Esteves would rather do more share offerings at parent BTG than IPO its digital bank, despite high valuations for digital peers.
Esteves himself is in no doubt about his role and three sources said he privately compares himself to the founders and owners of other Brazilian firms, including the late Joseph Safra of Banco Safra, arguing that his being in control has been good for BTG.

""To have the owner defining strategy is a clear advantage,"" he told colleagues during a meeting in September.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Tiffany & Co has settled its more than eight-year-old lawsuit accusing Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) of trademark infringement and counterfeiting for selling generic diamond engagement rings bearing the ""Tiffany"" name.
Monday's settlement came after the federal appeals court Manhattan in August threw out a $21 million judgment that Tiffany, acquired in January by French luxury goods company LVMH SE, won in 2017 following a jury trial.
A trial judge had found Costco liable for selling the disputed rings, despite its claim that ""Tiffany"" had become a generic term and described the rings' pronged setting. That left jurors to decide only how much Tiffany should recover.
But the appeals court said Costco acted in good faith, and that Costco customers were smart enough to realize Tiffany didn't make or endorse the warehouse chain's ""Tiffany"" rings.
An estimated 3,349 customers bought Tiffany-set rings at Costco during the period covered by the lawsuit, court papers showed.
David Bernstein, a lawyer for Costco, said in an email that the companies ""amicably resolved their dispute."" Tiffany issued a similar statement. Settlement terms were not disclosed.

Tiffany had sued Costco on Valentine's Day in 2013, to protect the now 184-year-old company's brand and cachet.
It ended the case after replacing its law firm this month. The dismissal filed with the federal court in Manhattan is with prejudice, meaning Tiffany cannot bring the lawsuit again.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland formalized a new policy on Monday that broadly prohibits prosecutors from subpoenaing reporters' phone and email records, an abrupt shift after the Trump administration secretly seized records from several major news outlets in an effort to root out leaks.
In addition to the new policy, Garland reiterated that the Justice Department would also throw its support behind new media-shield legislation to make the policy permanent.
""A free and independent press is vital to the functioning of our democracy,"" the memo says. ""The Department of Justice will no longer use compulsory legal process for the purpose of obtaining information from or records of members of the news media acting within the scope of newsgathering activities.""
The Justice Department last month held meetings with media executives to discuss formulating a new policy. The meetings came after several media companies - including the New York Times, CNN and the Washington Post- revealed that their reporters' records had been seized during Republican President Donald Trump's presidency in an effort to identify their confidential sources for national security stories.
Last month, the Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-denounces-trump-attorney-generals-reported-actions-democrats-phone-2021-06-11 his office had launched an inquiry into the seizure both of reporters' records, as well as the records of top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and committee member Eric Swalwell. 
The Justice Department previously said https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-justice-dept-says-it-will-no-longer-seize-reporters-records-leak-2021-06-05 it would stop the practice, but the details of the new policy had not been made public until Monday. 
The memo largely protects journalists in the course of their job. However, it does contain some limited exceptions.
A journalist who is the target or subject of a criminal investigation, for instance, can still have his or her records seized in matters not connected to their ""newsgathering activities,"" as can someone who has used ""criminal methods"" to obtain the information.
However, the policy makes it clear that prosecutors cannot subpoena a reporter's records merely because the reporter possesses or publishes classified information.
The protections also do not extend in cases where a person or entity is an agent of a foreign government, a member of a terrorist organization or if a person's life is in ""imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.""
In a joint statement, the presidents of the Washington-based National Press Club and its nonprofit affiliate, the National Press Club Journalism Institute, lauded the memo and said it strikes the right balance between protecting reporters while also protecting classified information.
""We are grateful the attorney general has at long last squared Justice Department policy with the First Amendment,"" said Lisa Nicole Matthews and Angela Greiling Keane. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of the press.

Matthews and Keane added that the ""broad and ongoing benefit"" of allowing journalists to be allowed to expose facts the government might prefer to keep under wraps ""outweighs the government’s interest in clamping down on any particular leak.""
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, on Monday said in a statement that he felt ""encouraged"" by the memo, and supports legislation ""to make certain that these changes are codified and remain the policy of the Department for years to come.""

Owing to their potential to benefit from their respective industry tailwinds, Sysco (SYY), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Darden (DRI), Whirlpool (WHR), and MKS (MKSI) could be ideal investment bets now. Let’s discuss.
The Federal Reserve raised the U.S. inflation forecast to 3.4% in 2021. This, along with a 5.4% increase in the Consumer Price Index over the past 12 months, as of June 2021, is raising investor concerns about the potential for a stock market crash in the near term. Also, rising COVID-19 cases worldwide with the spread of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus could put pressure on the stock market in the near term. Therefore, we think that betting on fundamentally sound stocks could be the ticket to hedge current downside risk in an investment portfolio.
Consumer-focused goods, steel, and medical devices industries are poised to grow substantially from demand driven by the economic recovery. So, we believe Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), ArcelorMittal (MT), Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI), Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), and  MKS Instruments , Inc.

They are each currently trading below their 52-week highs, but we think are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Read on.Increasing cybercrimes, such as the SolarWinds hack last year and the Colonial Pipeline incident earlier this year, have created increasing demand for advanced cybersecurity solutions. Notably, technology company Kaseya fell victim to a cyberattack earlier this month. Thus, governments worldwide have been taking measures to fight against cyber hackers. President Biden issued an executive order in May 2021 to improve the country’s cybersecurity threat defense.
Accelerating digitalization has necessitated companies’ increased reliance on cloud-based solutions, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Consequently , the demand for cybersecurity solutions is expected to go up in the foreseeable future. According to Grand View Research, the global cybersecurity market is expected to grow at a 10.9% CAGR over the next seven years. Also, investors’ interest in the cybersecurity industry is evidenced by the First Trust Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity ETF’s (CIBR) 26.9% returns over the past nine months.

The South Burlington, Vermont-based company, which is owned by Britain's Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc, has come under pressure from pro-Palestinian groups over its business in Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which is handled through a licensee partner since 1987.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, whose party favors Jewish settlements in the West Bank, said Ben & Jerry's was making a ""morally wrong"" decision.
More than 440,000 Israeli settlers live uneasily among some 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, land that Israel captured and occupied in a 1967 war but which Palestinians say is the heartland of a future state.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements on Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
On Monday, Ben & Jerry's said it would not renew its license agreement with its Israeli partner when it expires at the end of next year. It will, however, stay in Israel under a different arrangement, without sales in the Palestinian territories.
Unilever, in a separate statement, said it remains ""fully committed"" to its presence in Israel. It said it has always recognized Ben & Jerry's right ""to take decisions about its social mission"".
""We also welcome the fact that Ben & Jerry's will stay in Israel,"" Unilever said.
Ben & Jerry's operates a manufacturing facility and two scoop shops in Israel, which it describes on its website https://www.benjerry.com/about-us/media-center/palestine-statement as being located ""outside the occupied territories, just south of Tel Aviv.""
""We welcome the decision of any company to stop its work and investments in Israeli settlements,"" Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Israel's Bennett said: ""There are many ice cream brands, but only one Jewish state.""
""The boycott against Israel – a democracy surrounded by islands of terrorism – reflects a total loss of way. The boycott does not work and will not work, and we will fight it with full force,"" he said.
The Israeli boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) welcomed the move as ""a decisive step towards ending the company’s complicity in Israel’s occupation and violations of Palestinian rights.""
""Ben & Jerry’s, a leading socially responsible international company, is finally bringing its policy on Israel’s regime of oppression against Palestinians in line with its progressive positions on Black Lives Matter and other justice struggles,"" it said.
Israel has said the BDS movement is motivated by a desire to paint Israel as illegitimate.
""Over 30 states in the United States have passed anti-BDS legislation in recent years. I plan on asking each of them to enforce these laws against Ben & Jerry's,"" said Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid.
Vermonters for Justice in Palestine said in a provisional statement the move still ""fail(ed) to address the widespread anger at the actions of the Israeli government against Palestinian people who live in occupied territory"" and that ""Ben & Jerry's should completely disengage from Israel.""

Ben & Jerry's was acquired by Unilever in 2000 in a unique deal that allows it to operate with more autonomy than other subsidiaries.
It is well known for its commitment to social justice https://www.benjerry.com/values that has recently included strongly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, LGBTQ+ rights and electoral campaign finance reform.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 02:51PM ET</span>",Robinhood seeks up to $35 billion valuation in mega U.S. IPO,"By Niket Nishant and Sohini Podder
(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc is targeting a valuation of up to $35 billion in its initial public offering in the United States, the company revealed in a Monday filing, setting the stage for one of the most highly anticipated stock market listings this year.
The listing plans come just months after the online brokerage found itself at the center of a confrontation between a new generation of retail investors and Wall Street hedge funds in late January.
Robinhood was aiming for an IPO valuation of up to $40 billion, Reuters had previously reported.
About 55 million shares are being offered in the IPO, with shares expected to be priced between $38 and $42, the company said. This would raise over $2.3 billion if priced at the top of the range.
Nearly 2.63 million of those shares are being offered by the company's founders and chief financial officer, the filing showed. Proceeds from those will not go to Robinhood.
Salesforce Ventures, the investment arm of software provider Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM), is looking to purchase up to $150 million worth of Class A common stock at the IPO price, the filing showed.
As revealed by Reuters in March, Robinhood plans to reserve some of its offering for users of the trading app. Between 20% and 35% of shares will be allocated to users, dependent on demand from customers and other investors, the filing said.
In a separate statement, Robinhood said it would host a public event on July 24 to present its IPO plans and answer questions from potential investors. This is akin to traditional roadshows which companies and their advisers host with professional investment firms in the run-up to a share offering.
GOING MAINSTREAM
Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. They will hold a majority of the voting power after the offering, the filing showed, with Bhatt having around 39% of the voting power of outstanding stock while Tenev will hold about 26.2%. 
The company's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies. Its easy-to-use interface made it a go-to for young investors trading from home during coronavirus-induced restrictions and its popularity has soared over the past 18 months.
Robinhood has 18 million funded accounts as of Mar. 31, according to its filing.
The trading mania in the so-called meme stocks helped fuel a four-fold jump in its revenue over January to March, Robinhood's IPO filing earlier this month detailed, but the quick expansion came at a cost.
The company faced criticism after it was forced to curb trading in the middle of the surge this year in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other previously beaten-down stocks.
At the time, Robinhood was forced to raise $3.4 billion in emergency funds after its finances were strained by the massive jump in retail trading and a resulting jump in capital demands from clearing houses.
That round valued the company at around $30 billion, according to people familiar with matter.
Robinhood's stock market flotation comes amid a record 15-month run for the U.S. IPO market, as investors rushed to buy shares of high-growth tech companies. 

The company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""HOOD"". 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering.

Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are examples of this class of stock and should generate stable returns, dodging short-term market fluctuations. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is known for its innovative products, such as the iPhone, crossed the $2 trillion market cap level in August last year. It has a market capitalization of $2.44 trillion currently. In comparison, with a market cap of $1.80 trillion, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making significant advances in the cloud space via Amazon Web Services (AWS) and in the entertainment space through its Amazon Prime offerings, among others.
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.6% in June, and several financial companies reported strong earnings earlier this month. However, concerns surrounding the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, high inflation, and a decline in consumer sentiment have been raising questions about the stock market’s stability. Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in mega-cap stocks because of their impressive market dominance and solid long-term growth prospects. So, both AMZN and AAPL are good bets to generate steady returns over the long term.
AAPL has gained 12.5% over the past month, while AMZN returned 4.6%. Also, AAPL’s 23% gain over the past nine months is significantly higher than AMZN’s 9.2% returns. Furthermore, in terms of their past years’ performance, AAPL is the clear winner with 51.7% gains versus AMZN’s 19.1% returns.

(Reuters) - Office space provider IWG is set to open eight new shared-office centres in locations including London and New York, five of which were previously operated by its U.S.-based rival WeWork, as it seeks to meet the growing need for flexible work spaces.
Two of the former WeWork properties are located in Kensington, London, and Park Avenue South, New York, with three more in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. 
The other sites are in Chicago, Philadelphia, and opposite Penn Station in New York, according to a statement exclusively seen by Reuters. 
IWC, owner of the Spaces and Regus brands, has said demand for such sites was up 14% in June from pre-pandemic levels. It will invest in refurbishing the properties. 
IWG, which has its head office in Switzerland and more than 3,300 locations across 110 countries, added over 100 centres in the first half of 2021 through its franchise partners, three times as many as in the first half of 2020.
After a year in which the coronavirus pandemic shut office buildings and forced people to work from home, companies around the world are reducing their office space with an eye on trimming costs. 
""The pandemic has accelerated the shift to the hybrid model by 10 years ... There has been a rapid change,"" said Mark Dixon, the boss of IWG.
""Office spaces in cities like New York and London are going to shrink in a post-pandemic world as some people move back to towns and countryside. It is hard to quantify by how much.""
From U.S. tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to banks such as Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), firms have announced plans to adopt some form of flexible working model, typically having staff work from home for part of the week.

Dixon said there would be more change over the next three years as companies' leases end. 
""We are seeing a continuous interest in suburban and countryside locations as people avoid the commute and other hassles of a city life.""

Even with the economy reopening and social distancing requirements abating, the growing preference for virtual consultations should keep driving the telehealth industry’s growth. Consequently, Wall Street analysts expect leading players in this space, Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), American Well Corp (AMWL), and iRhythm Technologies (IRTC), to witness significant upside in the near term. Let’s discuss.The healthcare industry has been transforming in recent years, with the rising preference for telehealth and virtually enabled care. And while the COVID-19 pandemic strained the global healthcare industry, it has opened up new prospects for remote healthcare services. With more people opting for virtual medical consultations to save time and safely meet their healthcare needs, the telehealth market is gradually emerging as a post-pandemic winner.
While most countries are now reopening thanks to solid progress on the coronavirus vaccination front, extensive cloud-based tracking and rapid technological advances are projected to increase demand for online consultations, boosting the market for telehealth solutions. Moreover, the reduced patient-wait time and cost-effective treatment options afforded consumers by telehealth could further propel the demand for telehealth solutions. Consequently, the telehealth market is expected to reach $559.52 billion by 2027, growing at a 25.2% CAGR.
Given the industry’s solid growth prospects, Wall Street analysts expect key players in this space—Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC), American Well Corporation (AMWL), and iRhythm Technologies Inc. (IRTC)—to rally by more than 50% in the coming months.

Furthermore, the growing demand for steel from the manufacturing and construction sectors as the economic recovery gains steam should bode well for steel stocks. So, we believe steel names  Hillenbrand Inc . (NYSE:HI) and Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC) are solid bets now, given that they look cheap at their current price levels. Let’s take a closer look.The steel sector came to a standstill last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with both the output and consumption of steel plunging. However, the industry has been witnessing a considerable uptick in demand and is poised to return to pre-pandemic levels in-part based on the Biden administration’s proposed $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework that includes historic investments to rebuild the U.S. economy and infrastructure over the next eight years.
Since steel is widely used in construction and manufacturing activities, the potentially transformative investment opens enormous potential and development prospects for the industry. In addition, with the post-pandemic reopening of the economy, a substantial rise in construction and industry activities should propel the demand for steel. Indeed, the global steel market is expected to reach $1.01 trillion by 2025, representing a 2.6% CAGR. Given this solid backdrop, we believe shares of steel companies Hillenbrand Inc. (HI) and Boise Cascade L.L.C (BCC) are attractively cheap at their current price levels. Therefore, investing in these stocks could be rewarding.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG said Monday it will end U.S. sales and production of the Passat sedan next year, the latest shift by automakers away from cars and toward larger sport utility vehicles.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it will end U.S. assembly of the Passat sedan in Tennessee with model year 2022. VW has sold various versions of the Passat since 1974 in the United States - initially under the Dasher and Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) names - and the Passat name first appeared in the U.S. market in 1990.
Since 2011, Volkswagen has built more than 700,000 Passat vehicles at its Chattanooga factory. A version of the car has also been on sale in China, assembled by SAIC in Shanghai, the company said. 
VW is building its Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) SUV in Tennessee and next year will begin production of its electric ID.4 SUV at the U.S. plant.
More than 1.76 million Passat, Dasher and Quantum models have been sold in the United States since 1974.

Many automakers in the United States have dramatically cut back on car production and sales in recent years in favor of larger utility vehicles.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in 2018 announced it would largely abandon the U.S. sedan market saying it would stop selling the Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI), Focus, Taurus and Fusion sedans, the last of which was discontinued last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - It's ""Freedom Day"" as England marks the end of COVID-linked curbs, but with soaring infections expected to dampen summer trade, tourism and leisure shares are back to where they were last November during the second national lockdown.
From midnight, laws requiring masks to be worn in English shops and other indoor settings lapsed, along with capacity limits in bars and restaurants, and rules limiting the number of people who can socialise together.
The curbs ended even as UK infections approached 50,000 a day and Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced into self-isolation after health minister Sajid Javid tested positive for COVID-19.
On Monday, the FTSE 350 travel and leisure index sank 3.6% to its lowest since Nov. 23 and companies that might have been expected to reap the benefits of reopening were among the day's biggest losers. 
UK travel stocks beaten up on Freedom day https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxllgypx/travel.PNG 
The moves show ""investors think the reopening trade is now a dud"", said AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould.
He was referring to the bets investors had placed on sectors such as hospitality, expecting them to gain from Britain's blistering vaccination pace, which would allow people to travel, dine out and socialise before other European countries. 
But UK-listed shares of cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Plc EZJ) and British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) fell between 5% and 10%, reversing some of the gains they had notched up earlier this year.
Shares in Restaurant Group, which operates outlets such as Wagamama and Frankie & Bennie's, fell as much as 5.2% while Cineworld stocks were down around 10%. 
""The airlines, restaurants and leisure companies may not get the strong summer trading they've long hoped for,"" Mould added.
The sell-off coincides with a broader risk-off wave, with bond yields plumbing multi-month lows and world stocks facing their longest losing streak since the pandemic first hit. British losses weighed on euro zone counterparts, which fell 3.7%.
The British government argues that while 48,161 new cases of COVID-19 were recorded on Sunday, deaths and hospitalisations remain under control. But analysts drew parallels with last year when just before Christmas, Johnson announced a third national lockdown after initially wavering.
""The final removal of COVID restrictions (is) doing more to raise fears of a more pronounced outbreak than raise hopes around an economic boost,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.
Data from investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), based on its proprietary consumer behaviour gauges, showed UK retail and recreational mobility declining from June while cinema search interest too was down. 
UK retail and recreation activity https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoqqdkvd/jefferies.PNG 
AJ Bell's Mould called it ""a reality check"", as more Britons become infected or have to self-isolate. This is weighing heavily on hospitality firms, where 20% of staff are isolating, according to the Confederation of British Industry.

Jefferies said however it was positive on some leisure segments, suggesting Cineworld and The Restaurant Group as shares with potential upside. ""Consumer re-engagement and pent-up demand"" would still be supportive factors, it argued.

Investing.com –  Tractor Supply Company  (NASDAQ:TSCO) stock fell 7.6% Monday as renewed worries over the spread of Covid-19 overshadowed the record second-quarter earnings the rural lifestyle retailer announced today.
Broader worries over a stalling vaccination program in many countries and global economic growth amid a rapidly-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus were leading to a major selloff in stocks.
All geographic regions and major merchandising categories of the company reported comparable store sales growth. In addition, it experienced a record sales quarter in its e-commerce business.
The company expects net sales in the ongoing financial year to come between $12.1 billion and $12.3 billion, up from the $114 billion to $11.7 billion forecast earlier.
Diluted net earnings per share are seen in the range of $7.70 to $8 as against $7.05 to $7.40 forecast given earlier.
Net sales for the second quarter increased 13.4% year-on-year to $3.60 billion.
This was driven by robust growth in everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, and solid demand for spring and summer seasonal categories, the company said.
Net income increased 9.3% to $370 million and diluted EPS increased 10% to $3.19."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A 3.4-billion-euro ($2.9 billion) Dutch bailout for Air France-KLM's Dutch unit was necessary and proportionate, EU state aid regulators said on Monday after Europe's second-top court annulled their decision in May.
The Luxembourg-based General Court said that the European Commission, which acts as the bloc's competition enforcer, had not provided adequate reasoning why KLM was the only beneficiary of the Dutch aid and why the airline had not benefited from French support given to its parent.
Judges suspended the annulments, giving the Commission another chance to decide on the case. 
The Commission said it had addressed the court's concerns and also examined the Dutch and French aid and their effective beneficiaries.
""On this basis, the Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a member state,"" the EU executive said.

But the compromise still leaves Riyadh and Moscow on top.
Of all the adjustments agreed on Sunday to the cartel’s baselines -- the level from which each member’s cuts are measured -- the two largest OPEC+ members awarded themselves the biggest increases.
While the UAE’s baseline will rise by about 330,000 barrels a day to 3.5 million in May 2022 -- a 10% increase -- Moscow and Riyadh’s will jump by 500,000 barrels a day to 11.5 million
That may seem academic. Saudi Arabia has pumped that much only on the rarest of occasions, and the International Energy Agency sees Russia’s true capacity at 10.4 million barrels a day. Yet the generous headroom offered by these large numbers means the two countries will get back to pre-Covid output levels more quickly than fellow members, and keep going even higher if they are able.
As early as November, Saudi Arabia is on track to restore production to March 2020 levels -- before the worst effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and before the price war that briefly pushed the kingdom’s output to a record.
Russia will pass that milestone in April 2022, assuming the 400,000 barrel-a-day monthly production increases are shared out proportionally between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.
By September 2022, when OPEC+ expects to have revived all of the oil production halted because of the pandemic, the UAE’s quota limit may still be pumping less than it did before the Covid-19 crisis.

Investing.com –  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock fell 1.7% Monday as S&P (NYSE:SPGI) warned that halting of manufacturing in Vietnam by two of its suppliers might exacerbate the supply chain disruptions the company has had to deal with.
Shares were also lower as broader market worries about the Delta variant stalling a reviving global economy added to the adverse sentiment.
Reuters had on July 14 and July 15 reported that Chang Shin and Pou Chen, key Vietnamese suppliers to Nike, had halted production as Covid-19 curbs hit factories in Ho Chi Minh City and in business areas around it.
A resurgent virus, mostly the Delta variant of the original coronavirus, is raging through many parts of the world including the U.S., the U.K., parts of Europe and Asia. Factory shutdowns and curbs on outdoor activity have returned at many of those places.
Data from Panjiva, a business line of S&P Global Market Intelligence, pointed out that Vietnam accounted for 49% of U.S. seaborne imports linked to Nike and its products in the second quarter of 2021.
“There has been a refocusing on China though, with imports up 54.6% year over year in the second quarter of 2021 being the major driver of a 12.5% rise in total imports linked to the company,” Christopher Rogers (NYSE:ROG), senior researcher at Panjiva, wrote in a blog post on the S&P Global website.

RIDE went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, DiamondPeak Holdings. However, shares of the electric truck maker have declined 4.5% over the past five days after the company confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating matters related to its SPAC merger deal last year and the reporting of its pickup truck preorders. The company is headquartered in Lordstown, Ohio.
Moreover, RIDE’s shares have slumped 57.4% so far this year. This decline can be attributed primarily to investors’ concern surrounding the lawsuits the company is facing just when it is about to launch its pickup truck, the Endurance.
RIDE’s stock is currently trading 73.1% below its $31.8 all-time high. In addition to the ongoing probe and lawsuits, the company’s recent statement that it does not have sufficient funding to begin producing its electric truck at scale could worsen matters.

Zoom has become a household name and investor favorite in the year since the coronavirus pandemic, as businesses and schools adopted its services to hold virtual classes, office meets and socialize.
But with rapid vaccination and life creeping back to normality, analysts and investors are looking to see how Zoom will sustain its hot streak of growth, especially with rivals  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google snapping at its heels.
Five9, whose call center software is used by more than 2,000 clients across the globe to interact with their clients, counts firms such as Under Armour (NYSE:UA),  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc and Olympus Corp as customers.
The deal makes strategic sense, as it helps accelerate Zoom's product roadmap outside of its core offering,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note.
The San Jose, California-based company is now shifting focus to its two-year-old cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms as bigger players amp up their video products.
""The acquisition is expected to help enhance Zoom's presence with enterprise customers and allow it to accelerate its long-term growth opportunity by adding the $24-billion contact center market,"" Zoom said in a statement on Sunday.
Under the terms of the deal, approved by the boards of both companies, Five9 stockholders will receive 0.5533 shares of Zoom stock for each share of Five9. 
Based on Zoom's Friday close, this represents a price of $200.28 for each share of Five9 common stock, or nearly a 13% premium.
Zoom shares, which have surged more than 450% since going public in 2019, were down 1.5% on Monday. Five9 shares were up 6% at $188.5.
Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom and its chief executive, Rowan Trollope, will become a president of the company, staying on as chief of the unit after the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, it said.

Global spending on cloud-based conferencing is forecast to reach $5.41 billion this year, up from $5.02 billion in 2020, according to tech consultancy  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). It does not track market share, but analysts cite Zoom and Cisco as the leaders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The brokerage arm of UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges made by the U.S. securities regulator over compliance failures related to the sales of a volatility-linked, exchange-traded product, the regulator said on Monday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged UBS with failing to restrict its advisors from selling a complex product, which was not suitable to be held for extended periods, for two years beginning in January 2016.
The settlement is the sixth enforcement action stemming from an agency initiative targeting investment advisors' sales of certain exchange-traded products to retail investors.
The SEC said some financial advisors had a flawed understanding of the appropriate use of such a product, purchasing and holding the product in client accounts for lengthy periods that resulted in ""meaningful losses"".
A spokesperson for UBS, which neither denied nor admitted to the SEC's allegations, said the firm was ""pleased to have resolved this matter"".
""As the SEC acknowledged, UBS proactively reviewed and removed the product from its program before being contacted by the SEC,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
UBS agreed to pay another $112,274 in interest. The civil penalty will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell sharply at the open on Monday, as a surge in Covid-19 cases across the U.S. and further afield drove a wave of risk aversion that hit most asset classes. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 458 points, or 1.3%, at 34,229 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 1.2%, pulling away sharply from the record highs they had hit last week.The move came after a weekend of ill-tempered exchanges between the Biden administration and social media giants, which illustrated the mounting concern in Washington about the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19, a strain more than twice as contagious as earlier iterations of the virus. Infection rates are rising particularly strongly in the South and Midwest, where skepticism toward vaccines - and to most policies advanced by the Democratic administration - is highest.  The number of new cases across the U.S. hit its highest single-day level in over two months last week.
Ironically, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock outperformed the general rout, despite being singled out for criticism by administration officials up to and including President Joe Biden for allowing the spread of misinformation about vaccination on their networks. Facebook was down 1.4%.
Oil stocks were among the biggest losers, as fears that the economic recovery will lose momentum and kill demand combined with news of an end to OPEC's internal quarrel over production quotas at the weekend, paving the way for some 2 million barrels a day of supply to be restored to world markets by the end of the year.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 6.5%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 3.2% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 3.0%, as U.S. crude futures tumbled below $70 a barrel for the first time in over a month.
Broader reopening plays also reversed sharply, with AMC Entertainment  (NYSE:AMC) stock falling over 10%, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock falling over 6% each, and major airline stocks falling by between 4% and 7%. Financials were also hit as bond yields fell to their lowest in some five months, threatening to put fresh pressure on their lending margins. The yield on the United States 10-Year Treasury fell to its lowest since February at 1.21%. Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock all fell over 3%.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock couldn't escape the general selling despite agreeing a merger that pre-empts what some analysts had identified as a serious threat to its further growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A Tokyo court on Monday doled out the first sentences in Japan related to Carlos Ghosn's arrest and escape, imprisoning U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor for two years and his son Peter for one year and eight months for helping the former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd chairman flee to Lebanon in 2019. 
""This case enabled Ghosn, a defendant of serious crime, to escape overseas,"" Hideo Nirei, the chief judge, said while explaining the judgement. ""One year and a half has passed, but there is no prospect of the trial being held."" 
Wearing dark suits and flanked by four guards, the two remained silent during their 20-minute appearance at the Tokyo District Court. 
Nirei said the elder Taylor played a ""leading role"" in the escape by escorting Ghosn onto the jet, while his son had taken care of his luggage and provided him with a key to a hotel room where he changed clothes. 
The two men, who had faced up to three years in prison, pleaded guilty and made a tearful apology to the court last month, saying they regretted their role in smuggling Ghosn out of Japan hidden in a box aboard a private jet from Japan’s Kansai airport at the end of 2019. 
Prosecutors said the Taylors received $1.3 million for expenses and as payment, with another $500,000 for legal fees.
A Turkish court in February convicted Turkish company MNG and two pilots for their role in Ghosn's escape, sentencing the pilots to four years and two months in jail. 
The Taylors were arrested in the United States in May 2020, but did not arrive in Japan until March because their lawyers sought to prevent their extradition, arguing that they could not be prosecuted for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that they could face relentless interrogation and torture.
Suspects in Japan are interrogated without their lawyers present and are often denied bail before trial. 
Ghosn remains a fugitive in his childhood home of Lebanon, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with Japan.
In Japan he faces charges he understated his compensation in Nissan's financial statements by 9.3 billion yen ($85 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East.

Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive charged with helping Ghosn hide his compensation, is also on trial in Tokyo, with a judgment expected next year. Both Ghosn and Kelly deny the charges. 
The Taylors have 14 days to appeal the verdict and sentence.

The deal values Etro at about 500 million euros ($590 million), the sources said, confirming reports in Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Il Sole 24 Ore.
Etro said in a statement that L Catterton was taking a majority stake in the company, while the Etro family would retain ""a significant minority interest"". It did not go into specifics and gave no financial details.
Gerolamo Etro, who founded the company in 1968, will be the chairman and the deal is set to be closed by the end of the year, the statement said. 
""We are thrilled to be working with the L Catterton team who will bring their in-depth knowledge of the fashion sector and an experience in the international development of important brands, allowing our company to reach new heights,"" the firm said.
LVMH and L Catterton were not immediately available for comment.
In April, a source close to the matter had told Reuters that the Milan-based luxury brand was considering an expression of interest from L Catterton, an investment firm born out of a partnership among Catterton, LVMH and its billionaire owner Bernard Arnault. 

One of the sources said Etro's four children would stay on as shareholders with a 40% stake and would remain owners of Etro's real estate property and directly operated stores. 
L Catterton recently bought German sandal maker Birkenstock. LVMH, which owns a string of Italian labels including jeweller Bulgari, also boosted its stake in Italian luxury shoemaker Tod's to 10% in April.

The UK travel industry has for months criticised the government's strict quarantine rules and last minute changes to country classifications which has resulted in a roller-coaster of booking surges followed by mass cancellations. 
Britain said on Friday that it was scrapping a planned easing of coronavirus rules for fully-vaccinated UK arrivals into England from France. Rising cases of one coronavirus variant in France meant that arrivals from there would no longer be exempt from quarantine.
The surprise raised concerns about further changes, discouraging people from booking, just when fully-vaccinated people are able to travel to most of Europe without needing to quarantine on return.
Shares in easyJet, whose biggest market is Britain, were down almost 6% in midday trading, while IAG was down 4%, and TUI and Jet2 down more than 3%. 
The stocks have all lost around 20% of their value over the last three months as new variants and ongoing travel rules and restrictions have crushed hopes for a bumper summer. They are all trading well below where they were prior to the pandemic. 
""Fears are that Spain and Greece could be similarly treated,"" Goodbody analysts said in a note. 
Spain was Britain's no.1 destination before the pandemic, with France in no.2 position. Greece is another popular destination for British holidaymakers.
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said Britain's traffic light system, which classifies countries as green, amber or red depending on their COVID-19 risk level, was ""falling apart"" and causing confusion and uncertainty. 

Britain's travel recovery lags that of other European countries. Eurocontrol data showed that on July 12, UK flight numbers were 65% down on the same day in 2019, behind Spain, Germany, France and Italy which were down between 30% and 45%. 
Figures released by Britain's busiest airport Heathrow showed passenger numbers in June were still nearly 90% down on pre-pandemic 2019 numbers.

It said the overall increase in shopper numbers, or footfall, was driven by a 3.3% rise in high street shopper traffic, which more than offset declines of 0.8% and 2.2% in retail parks and shopping centres respectively.
""There was a glimmer of hope for the hospitality industry, as the most gains in footfall were made post 5 p.m. as shoppers took the opportunity provided by hot weather to enjoy hospitality venues,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's insights director.
High street footfall post 5 p.m. rose by 9.8% from the week before compared with 1.9% up to 5 p.m.
Springboard said overall UK footfall was down 24.9% compared with the same week in 2019, before the pandemic started to disrupt traffic.

The pandemic has hammered Britain's retailers, already struggling with high rents and business taxes, tight margins and online competition. Hundreds of store closures and thousands of job losses have been announced.
Springboard forecast that shopper numbers will rise by nearly one fifth this week versus the previous week thanks to the lifting of most remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England on Monday.

Continued strength in the Australian economy had assured the lenders were largely unscathed from the pandemic, with ANZ adding that it would consider returning more capital in the future.

The on-market buyback would likely reduce ANZ's March 2021 Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio by about 35 basis points, the lender said. ANZ had reported Level 1 CET1 ratio for that period of 12.2%.

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was trading 0.4% lower in Monday’s premarket trading after U.S. President Joe Biden accused it of ""killing people"" by allowing the spread of misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines on its social network. 
“The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they’re killing people,” he said when asked about companies like Facebook.
Biden's comments express an increasing frustration with social media companies, which his administration blames for slowing the pace of vaccination in many states, allowing the Covid-19 a fresh foothold in the country. Vaccination has almost ground to a halt in Republican heartlands of the South and Midwest, where the population remains broadly skeptical of most Democratic Party policy.
Already on Thursday, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy accused the social media companies of not doing enough to curb misinformation around vaccines. He and other administration officials are concerned that the networks provide platforms to anti-vaxxers to spread falsehoods about vaccines when scientific evidence points overwhelmingly to their effectiveness in curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives.
The social media giant was quick to reply, however.
“The Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,” Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said in a blog post Saturday. “The fact is that vaccine acceptance among Facebook users in the U.S. has increased.”
Rosen called on the administration to stop “finger-pointing”.
President Biden had set a goal of getting 70% of Americans vaccinated by July 4, a target the Federal government fell short of.
“Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,” the Facebook executive wrote.

CANBERRA (Reuters) -Telstra Corp Ltd said on Monday it was in talks to buy the Pacific operations of telecommunications firm Digicel Group in partnership with the Australian government, a move widely viewed as a political block to China's influence in the region. 
Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) said the government would finance the bulk of any bid for Jamaica-based Digicel, the largest mobile phone carrier in the Pacific with operations in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and Tahiti. 
Digicel's future has been the focus of market and media speculation for several months. It last year denied an Australian newspaper report it was considering a sale of its Pacific business to state-owned China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd.
A sale of Digicel to a Chinese company would be a cause of concern for the Australian government amid strategic competition between U.S. allies and China in the Pacific region.
""The Australian government is trying to achieve a few things at once. Digicel is the primary player in the Pacific and Australia sees it as strategic asset that they can't allow to fall into the hands of China,"" said Jonathan Pryke, Director, Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank.
""They are keen to get Australian business back into the Pacific and they've come to the realisation that they are going to have to underwrite.""
A Digicel spokesman declined to comment. A spokesperson for Australia's Minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, also declined to comment. 
A spokesman for Australia's department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was inappropriate to comment on the ""incomplete commercial discussions of a publicly listed company,"" but said that: ""Partnering on infrastructure development is a key part of our Pacific Step-up.""
He said the government supports businesses investing in infrastructure in the Pacific, ""including communications infrastructure, which plays a key role in economies across the region"".
The Chinese embassy in Canberra did not respond to requests for comment.
Telstra said it was initially approached by the Australian government ""to provide technical advice in relation to Digicel Pacific, which is a commercially attractive asset and critical to telecommunications in the region.""
""If Telstra were to proceed with a transaction it would be with financial and strategic risk management support from the government,"" the company said in a statement.
Telstra did not provide financial details, but Australian media reported a deal would be worth about A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) with the Australian government paying around A$1.5 billion. 
Using details reported by the media, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated a deal would be valued at between A$1.9 billion to $2.5 billion, with equity split after debt seeing Telstra acquire up to 30%.
A deal would require Digicel to underwrite its future revenue forecasts for three years, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
UNDERSEA CABLES 
Australia has ramped up its presence in the Pacific through the creation of a A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) infrastructure financing facility and via its membership of the “Quad” group, together with the United States, India and Japan, to counter China’s expanding interests in the Indo-Pacific.
Digicel, founded by Irish billionaire Denis O’Brien, has a dominant market share in Papua New Guinea and uses a submarine cable from Sydney that was constructed with funding from the Australian government to expand data services there.
Australia stepped in to largely fund the 4,700-km (2,900-mile) Coral Sea cable in 2018 to head off initial agreements by Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands for Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to lay the cable.
Australia, the United States and Japan are financing an undersea optic fibre cable for Palau, while sources told Reuters last month that Nauru is negotiating for the construction of an undersea communications cable that would connect to an Australian network. Nauru earlier rejected a Chinese proposal.

Washington has pressed governments around the world to squeeze Huawei and other Chinese companies out of supplying sensitive communications equipment, alleging the company could hand over data to the Chinese government for spying, a charge denied by Beijing and Chinese telcos.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Assa Abloy (OTC:ASAZY), the world's biggest lockmaker, beat expectations with a 71% jump in second-quarter operating profit on Monday, saying demand picked up in many of its markets even as travel-related sectors, such as hotels, still lagged.
The company - whose products range from security doors and automated entrance solutions to electronic and mechanical locks under a wide range of brands such as Yale, said sales returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic levels in three divisions including its biggest, Entrance Systems. 
The group's operating profit was 3.59 billion crowns ($413.8 million) against 2.10 billion a year earlier and a mean forecast of 3.47 billion in a Refinitiv poll of analysts.
Sales before acquisitions jumped a record 23% from a year ago, when sales slumped due to the pandemic. 
""As we look forward, we expect mobility to increase and demand in many markets and segments to normalize, apart from the travel-related verticals where restrictions are still delaying our recovery,"" Chief Executive Nico Delvaux said in a statement. 
Assa Abloy said its Global Technologies division grew like-for-like sales by 17% though volumes in travel-related segments, such as hotels, which it supplies with key cards, in-room safes and electronic door locks, still remained lower than before the pandemic. 
The company, whose rivals include Allegion (NYSE:ALLE) and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK), said product price increases had largely offset rising raw material costs and it had managed to deal with shortages of some components during the quarter. 
Assa Abloy is betting on electronic locks as a key growth driver in future, and said on Monday the pandemic was accelerating the transition towards such products that require less or no touching.

Sales of such locks rose 16% in the quarter, to nearly a third of group sales.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, with continuing concerns over rising numbers of Covid-19 cases globally weighing on sentiment. Oil prices are also falling as producers agree to increase output.
At 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.3%.
A number of European countries, including France, the Netherlands, Greece and Spain, announced new restrictions last week in a bid to curb a rise in infections, largely due to the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.
The French government has since backtracked on plans for sweeping new rules to expand the use of vaccination certificates after massive protests at the weekend. However, fully jabbed travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to quarantine from Monday. 
This has hit the travel industry, with easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock down 5.3%, IAG (LON:ICAG), which owns British Airways, stock down 4.8%, and Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock down 3.7%. 
Against this background, England is lifting its restrictions Monday, including social distancing rules and limits on social gathering, trusting a successful vaccination program to defend its population from serious illness as the number of its recorded Covid cases tops 50,000 a day.
Staying in Europe, the destruction caused by massive flooding around Germany and Belgium over the last few days could also weigh on sentiment this week. RWE (DE:RWEG) stock fell 3% after the German energy company said the floods have caused tens of millions of euros of damage to its sites.
In other corporate news, the Financial Times reported that Italian fashion group Ermenegildo Zegna has agreed to go public by combining with the special-purpose acquisition company, New York-listed Investindustrial Acquisition Corp., resulting in an enterprise value of $3.2 billion.
Elsewhere, Billionaire investor Bill Ackman rejigs his plans to buy up to 10% of Vivendi's (OTC:VIVHY) Universal Music Group, and will now use his main hedge fund for the purchase, rather than a special purpose acquisition company.
 Ubisoft  Entertainment (PA:UBIP) stock fell 1% after the games maker delayed the launch of two new games - Rainbow Six Extraction by four months and Riders Republic - by just under two months.
The economic data slate is pretty empty in Europe Monday, but investors will cautiously await Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank. The Governing Council is expected to announce more dovish guidance after giving itself the freedom to tolerate slightly higher inflation with its recent strategy review.
Elsewhere, oil prices weakened Monday after a group of top producers agreed over the weekend to boost output, overcoming an internal spat that threatened the stability of the market.
The group, which includes members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia, agreed to add 400,000 barrels a day every month from August 2021 onwards, with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait and Russia also receiving higher baselines against which their output cuts are measured from May 2022.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: J&J exploring putting talc liabilities into bankruptcy, sources say","By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Dan Levine
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is exploring a plan to offload liabilities from widespread Baby Powder litigation into a newly created business that would then seek bankruptcy protection, according to seven people familiar with the matter.
During settlement discussions, one of the healthcare conglomerate’s attorneys has told plaintiffs’ lawyers that J&J could pursue the bankruptcy plan, which could result in lower payouts for cases that do not settle beforehand, some of the people said. Plaintiffs’ lawyers would initially be unable to stop J&J from taking such a step, though could pursue legal avenues to challenge it later. 
J&J has not yet decided whether to pursue the bankruptcy plan and could ultimately abandon the idea, some of the people said. Reuters could not determine whether J&J has retained restructuring lawyers to help the company explore the bankruptcy plan. 
J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. 
“Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,” the J&J subsidiary housing the company’s talc products said in a statement provided to Reuters. J&J declined further comment.
Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company. Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities. 
J&J is now considering using Texas's “divisive merger” law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities. For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation, some of the people said. 
The maneuver is known among legal experts as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used in recent years. 
J&J could also explore using another mechanism to effectuate the bankruptcy filing besides the Texas law, some of the people said. 
A 2018 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.
The blue-chip company, which boasts a roughly $443 billion market value, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J’s appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company’s talc caused their ovarian cancer. 
Plaintiffs’ lawyers view the two-step bankruptcy strategy as one that skirts potentially expensive settlements or judgments. Companies view it as a way to corral numerous lawsuits in one court for efficient negotiations that bankruptcy law dictates for asbestos liabilities. The company outside bankruptcy can reach a funding agreement with the entity navigating a court restructuring to cover future settlement payments.
In 2017, Brawny paper towels manufacturer Georgia-Pacific used the Texas law to move asbestos liabilities to an entity that later filed for bankruptcy in North Carolina. 
Bankruptcy cases filed to resolve litigation, including those related to asbestos, often take years, and almost never fully repay creditors. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, for instance, is near resolving thousands of opioid lawsuits after two years of bankruptcy negotiations with a plan valued at more than $10 billion to address trillions of dollars in claims.
Another company, DBMP LLC, filed for bankruptcy last year to resolve asbestos liabilities and said the case could take up to eight years, according to a company press release. 

J&J also faces litigation alleging it contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic and recently recalled certain spray sunscreen products after discovering some of them contained low levels of benzene, another carcinogen.
The company in June agreed to pay $263 million to resolve opioid claims in New York. It has denied wrongdoing related to its opioids.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down, falling to a one-week low, on Monday morning, as continuing concerns about the impact of continuously rising COVID-19 cases, alongside inflationary pressures, on the global economic recovery dampened investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.69% by 10:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.20%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.98%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest policy meeting on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.18%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.25% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.23%.
U.S. shares also closed their previous session on a downward trend, with the S&P 500 falling for the first week in four. Meanwhile, a rally in U.S. Treasuries continued, with the benchmark 10-year yield further below the 1.3% mark.
The debate over whether inflationary pressure will cause central banks to start asset tapering, in turn slowing down the economic recovery from COVID-19, saw the recent rally in global shares hit pause.
Investors also digested the decline in Treasury yields. Some investors saw the trend as a sign that the economic recovery is slowing down as countries reimpose restrictive measures to curb COVID-19 outbreaks involving the Delta variant, while others suggested that it is the bond rally that is slowing down.
“The COVID-19 backdrop is just one of several factors that may be adversely impacting the reflation trade,” RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said in a note.
Others include the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering stimulus and hiking sooner than expected, the note added.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell insisted in his testimony before Congress, delivered during the previous week, that increasing inflation is likely a temporary phenomenon. However, markets are yet to be fully convinced by his reassurance that supportive monetary policy will remain in place for some time yet.
Elsewhere on the central bank front, both the European Central Bank and Bank Indonesia will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday.
All eyes are now on the U.K., where the remaining COVID-19 measures are due to be lifted as of Jul. 19, with increasing inflation also continuing to be a focal point.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts downgraded their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2020 to 6.5% from the previous 7% but maintained their 5.5% forecast for 2022.
""As for inflation, the bad news is it’s likely to remain elevated near term... the good news is... we are likely near the peak, at least for the next few months, as base effects are less favorable and shortage pressures rotate away from goods towards services,"" they said in a note."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court late Saturday in a 2-1 ruling put on hold a lower-court decision that said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not enforce its coronavirus cruise ship rules in the state.
Last month, U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday in siding with Republican-led Florida found the state was ""highly likely"" to show the CDC exceeded its authority in adopting rules governing the resumption of cruise ship sailing. 
The brief order from the 11th Circuit panel came about 10 minutes before Merryday's ruling was to take effect on Sunday, which would have made the CDC rules a non-binding recommendation rather than mandatory. 
The CDC in May began approving some cruise operations after lengthy talks with the industry about health and safety protocols.
Its conditional sail order said cruise lines that ensured at least 95% of passengers and nearly all crew were vaccinated could bypass simulated voyages and move more quickly to resuming commercial trips.
The Justice Department said last week in a filing with the appeals court that ""there is no basis to lift the COVID-19 health and safety protocols that were developed by (CDC) in collaboration with the cruise ship industry.""
The CDC declined to comment Sunday.
The offices of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and state Attorney General Ashley Moody did not immediately comment on Sunday. DeSantis had argued the CDC rules disregarded ""the freedom of Floridians to make decisions for their families.
Florida, a major hub for cruise operators, said in April its ports had suffered a decline in operating revenue of almost $300 million since the pandemic started.

On Tuesday, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings sued the state of Florida saying a state law was preventing it ""from safely and soundly resuming passenger cruise operations"" from Miami starting August 15. A judge has set an Aug. 6 preliminary injunction hearing.
Florida state law expressly prohibits cruise lines from requiring documentation of COVID-19 vaccines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday defended itself against U.S. President Joe Biden's assertion that the social media platform is ""killing people"" by allowing misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to proliferate, saying the facts tell a different story.
""The data shows that 85% of Facebook users in the US have been or want to be vaccinated against COVID-19,"" Facebook said in a corporate blog post by Guy Rosen, a company vice president. ""President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.""
COVID-19 misinformation has spread during the pandemic on social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned YouTube. Researchers and lawmakers have long accused Facebook of failing to police harmful content on its platforms. 
""They're killing people. ... Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about misinformation and what his message was to social media platforms such as Facebook.
The company has introduced rules against making specific false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines for it, and says it provides people with reliable information on these topics.

The Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant strain worldwide, accompanied by a surge of deaths around the United States almost entirely among unvaccinated people, U.S. officials said on Friday.
American cases of COVID-19 https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states are up 70% over the previous week and deaths are up 26%, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates.

Shares of the world's top dairy exporter have fallen around a fifth since it laid out a range of options to overhaul its capital structure and allow farmers easier entry to the cooperative as it seeks to firm up its financial future.
Since then, the New Zealand company said it has had 90 meetings with farmers, with 5,000 of them directly engaging with the company. It has more than 10,000 farmer shareholders. 
Among changes being considered by the board include adjusting the minimum shareholding requirements for farmers to 33% of milk supply, or one share per 3 kg of milk solids (kgMS), rather than the 25%, or the one per 4 kgMS, initially proposed. 
Fonterra will also consider keeping the maximum number of shares at four times milk supply to support liquidity, allowing share milkers and contract milkers to hold shares if the cooperative moves to a farmer-only market, as well as extending the entry period to six years from five years. 

The company said it would provide more information on its long-term strategy, including the type of activities in which it will invest and the returns it will target, in August and September. 
The size of the listed Fonterra Shareholders Fund, which is open to non-farmer investors, had been capped until November to give the farmers time to discuss options.

(Reuters) -Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos and his three crewmates are engaging in a crash course of training on Sunday in preparation for his company Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space planned for Tuesday.
The suborbital launch from a site in the high desert plains of West Texas marks a crucial test for Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, a 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that is central to plans by Bezos to tap a potentially lucrative space tourism market.
The planned 11-minute trip from the company's Launch Site One facility is set to include the oldest person ever to go to space - 82-year-old trailblazing female aviator Wally Funk - and the youngest - 18-year-old physics student Oliver Daemen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-blueorigin/teenager-to-fly-with-bezos-in-inaugural-space-tourism-flight-idUSKBN2EL1ZJ?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews. Joining them for Blue Origin's launch will be Bezos, the founder and current executive chairman https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/whats-next-amazons-bezos-look-his-instagram-2021-07-03 of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and his brother Mark Bezos.
The mission https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/first-human-flight-updates would represent the world's first unpiloted flight to space with an all-civilian crew. Blue Origin, which will have none of its staff astronauts https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/bezos-blue-origin-make-history-with-unpiloted-civilian-space-flight-2021-07-14 or trained personnel onboard, expressed confidence at a briefing on Sunday. 
""We are not currently working any open issues and New Shepard is ready to fly,"" Flight Director Steve Lanius said, adding that the weather forecast appeared favorable for the scheduled liftoff at 8 a.m. CDT (1300 GMT) on Tuesday.
New Shepard is due to launch nine days after rival Richard Branson's space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, successfully carried out a suborbital flight https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 from New Mexico with the British billionaire inside its rocket plane.
Blue Origin's training program, according to the company, includes safety briefings, a simulation of the spaceflight, a review of the rocket and its operations, and instruction on how to float around the craft's cabin after the capsule sheds Earth's gravity.
Bezos and his crewmates had started the 14-hour program on Sunday and would be ready to ""experience the flight of a lifetime"", Ariane Cornell, director of astronaut sales at Blue Origin, said. Cornell said Funk was keen to do a few somersaults during the flight.
New Shepard, which cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft, is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 became the first American in space during a suborbital flight as part of NASA's pioneering Mercury program. 
New Shepard, like Virgin Galactic's flight, will not enter into orbit around Earth but will take the crew some 62 miles up (100 km) before the capsule returns by parachute. Virgin Galactic's flight reached 53 miles (86 km) above Earth.
Billionaire businessman Elon Musk's space transportation company, SpaceX, is pledging to go even higher in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule. 
Illustrating tensions in the high-stakes ""billionaire space race,"" Blue Origin has described Virgin Galactic as falling short of the 62-mile-high-mark (100 km) - called the Kármán line - set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. 

The U.S. space agency NASA and the U.S. Air Force both define an astronaut as anyone who has flown higher than 50 miles (80 km), as Branson achieved with his flight.
Blue Origin's next flight would likely be at the end of September or early October, said Chief Executive Officer Bob Smith. Smith said the ""willingness to pay continues to be quite high"" for people interested in future flights.

Nationwide, new U.S. COVID-19 cases surged 70% this week compared with the prior seven days to an average of 30,000 new infections a day, fueled by the Delta variant. Deaths rose 26% week-over-week to an average of 250 lives lost a day, mostly in unvaccinated patients. (Graphic of global cases and deaths) https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi
Murthy said that social media companies have fueled false narratives about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, echoing President Joe Biden's comments that social media companies were ""killing people."" https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/white-house-says-facebooks-steps-stop-vaccine-misinformation-are-inadequate-2021-07-16 
""There have been positive steps taken by these technology companies,"" Murthy said. ""But what I've also said to them publicly and privately is that it's not enough.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) defended itself against Biden's assertion in a post https:// on Saturday, saying that it promoted authoritative information about vaccines and acted aggressively against health misinformation on its platforms. 
Democratic Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that she was looking into ways to hold social companies legally responsible for vaccine misinformation and suggested some might even need to be broken up.
""I am a fan of using anti-trust so we can get true competition against the dominant platforms,"" Klobuchar said. 

Ken McClure, the mayor of Springfield, Missouri, blamed misinformation as part of the driving force behind poor vaccination rates in his community which has experienced a huge spike in COVID-19 cases.
""I think we're seeing a lot spread through social media,"" McClure told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""I think we as a society and certainly in our community are being hurt by it.""

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) -The Tune Squad ruled over the court and box office charts this weekend. In an unexpected win, ""Space Jam: A New Legacy,"" which sees LeBron James team up with the animated Looney Tunes crew, dunked on the competition with $31.6 million in ticket sales. 
The Warner Bros. sequel to 1996's ""Space Jam"" surpassed forecasts, which projected the film would bring in $20 million in its first three days of release. Critics rebuffed ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" (it holds a bleak 31% average on Rotten Tomatoes), but audiences appeared to embrace the movie, awarding it an ""A-"" CinemaScore. ""Space Jam 2"" played in 3,965 cinemas in North America, while being available on HBO Max at no extra charge to subscribers.
""The marketing on this movie really looked fun, and it helped alert audiences everywhere,"" said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution.
The better-than-expected start for ""Space Jam 2"" pushed last weekend's champion, Disney and Marvel's ""Black Widow,"" to second place on box office charts. The superhero adventure, starring Scarlett Johansson, brought in $26.3 million in its second weekend, representing a huge 67% decline. So far, ""Black Widow"" has generated $131 million in North America and $264 million globally.
Despite concerns over the Delta variant and its hybrid release on HBO Max, ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" landed the largest debut for a family film during COVID. Earlier in the pandemic, movies geared toward younger audiences -- such as ""The Croods: A New Age"" and ""Tom and Jerry"" -- had been the biggest moneymakers. But summer offerings like ""The Boss Baby: Family Business,"" ""Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway"" and ""Spirit Untamed"" had each fallen flat with family crowds. ""Space Jam 2,"" which arrived 26 years after the original, is the first film in some time to bring moviegoers with kids back to theaters. Males accounted for 53% of sales, while 52% of ticket buyers were under the age of 25.

""This weekend is a positive indication that the family audience is alive, well and, according to 'Space Jam 2's' enthusiastic audience scores, still thrilled by the big screen,"" says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research.
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s ""Escape Room: Tournament of Champions"" opened in third place with $8.4 million from 2,815 locations. Though on par with industry expectations, its three-day debut marks a steep decline from its predecessor, 2019's ""Escape Room,"" which debuted to $18 million and ended its box office run with $57 million. The sequel cost $15 million to produce, an increase from the first film's $9 million price tag.
At No. 4, Universal's ""Fast and Furious"" sequel ""F9"" pulled in $7.6 million in its fourth weekend of release, bringing its overall domestic tally to $154 million. Another Universal title, ""The Boss Baby: Family Business,"" rounded out the top five, generating $4.7 million over the weekend. In total, the animated sequel to 2017's ""Boss Baby"" has made $44 million in theaters while playing simultaneously on the nascent streaming service Peacock."

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - A World Bank programme to help medical clinics in Ivory Coast procure equipment from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Philips could spur the cocoa-producing country's development into a regional medical hub, Prime Minister Patrick Achi said on Sunday. 
As in other African countries, many smaller clinics in Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, struggle to obtain the bank loans necessary to buy or rent essential medical equipment. 
A $300 million financing agreement signed on Friday by Ivory Coast and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) aims to remedy that situation by providing credit to clinics hoping to get supplies from Philips and General Electric. 
""If we do not solve the problem of equipping our private clinics and hospitals, this goal of seeing the private (health) sector grow and create jobs will be a failure,"" Achi told Reuters. 
The programme is part of the IFC's Africa Medical Equipment Facility, which partners with African financial institutions and global medical supply firms to give local currency loans to small- and medium-sized clinics for equipment purchases.
As part of the agreement, Philips and General Electric will become the only two companies from which Ivorian private and public medical facilities procure medical equipment, Achi said.
Achi sees the agreement's exclusivity clause as a reason for optimism. By limiting options to just two suppliers, Achi said that clinics will be able to secure their equipment at lower costs and with easier access to spare parts.

But the programme's greatest impact will be on clinics seeking to grow into larger medical facilities, Achi said. If smaller institutions can finance their own expansions, so too can the country expand its regional medical footprint.
""One of the strong axes of the project ... is to ensure that Ivorians who have created clinics have the possibility of becoming hospitals and sub-regional hospitals, so that Ivory Coast becomes a hospital destination - a medical hub,"" Achi said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Walmart's Flipkart should not be treated the same as rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in an Indian antitrust probe as the evidence against the two firms was ""qualitatively different"", Flipkart argued in a court filing seen by Reuters.
Both Amazon and Flipkart have challenged the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in court as they seek revocation of an Indian court's June decision to allow https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-court-dismisses-pleas-by-amazon-flipkart-quash-antitrust-probe-lawyer-2021-06-11 an antitrust probe against them to continue. The companies deny any wrongdoing.
India's government has called the U.S. firms arrogant https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-commerce-minister-arrogant-us-ecommerce-giants-flout-our-laws-2021-06-27 and accused them of using legal routes to stall the investigation.
In final submissions made to a court in southern India's Karnataka state, the Walmart (NYSE:WMT) unit argued that CCI and the court ""confuse the facts"" between the case of Amazon and Flipkart, and overlooked that they were ""fierce competitors"".
To back its arguments, it said that a business agreement examined by the CCI before ordering its probe was only between Amazon and its sellers, and there was no such evidence against the Walmart unit.
""The allegations and the evidence before the CCI against the Appellant were qualitatively different from those relating to Amazon ... The CCI should have independently examined the case against each of the two platforms,"" Flipkart said in its 46-page submission, which was not public.
The Indian court is likely to pass a written order on the appeals in coming days. 
Flipkart and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CCI didn't respond outside regular business hours on Sunday.
For years, Amazon and Flipkart have denied allegations from brick-and-mortar retailers about circumventing Indian law by creating complex business structures.
Trade minister Piyush Goyal last month lashed out on U.S. e-commerce giants for filing legal challenges and failing to comply with the CCI's probe, saying ""if they have nothing to hide ... why don't they respond to the CCI?""
In February, a Reuters investigation https://reut.rs/2OCOT2W based on internal Amazon documents showed the U.S. firm for years had helped a small number of sellers prosper on its platform in India, using them to bypass foreign investment laws. Amazon also has indirect equity stakes in two of its big online sellers, Cloudtail and Appario, which get ""subsidized fees"", Reuters reported.
The Walmart unit argued in its submission that ""unlike in the case of Amazon"", there were no structural links of any kind between Flipkart and its sellers.

Flipkart ""ought to have been treated differently from Amazon,"" it said.
Amazon and Flipkart are leading players in an e-retail market India forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2026.

(Reuters) -Some U.S. tech companies expressed disappointment with a ruling by a federal judge that blocked new applications to a program that protects immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from deportation.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen on Friday sided with a group of states suing to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, arguing that it was illegally created by former President Barack Obama in 2012.
""We have long argued in support of this program, filing an amicus brief in this case, and we are very disappointed by the decision (from the judge)"", Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.
""Dreamers and immigrants make the United States — and Twitter — better"", a spokesperson from social media platform Twitter said in an emailed statement.
Twitter, Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Photoshop maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) urged the U.S. Congress to come together to protect Dreamers, with Google saying they wanted DACA to be ""cemented"" into law.
Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the ""disappointing"" ruling created ""uncertainty yet again for Dreamers.""
The judge ruled on Friday that the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when it was created but said that since there were so many people currently enrolled in the program - nearly 650,000 - his ruling would be temporarily stayed for their cases and their renewal applications.

Biden, who was vice president when Obama created the program, has said he wants to create a permanent pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, known as ""Dreamers.""
On Saturday, Biden vowed to preserve the program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, promising to appeal the judge's ruling invalidating it and urging Congress to provide a path to citizenship.

LISBON (Reuters) - Two hundred flights were cancelled at Lisbon airport on Saturday at the start of a two-day strike by Groundforce handling company workers, with more cancellations likely before the action ends on Sunday evening, the company that manages Portugal's airports (ANA) said.
A spokesman for the Union of Airport Handling Technicians, which called the strike, told local news agency Lusa that around 100% of workers had taken part in the strike in Lisbon on Saturday, the busiest airport in the country.
The strike has had a huge impact on the Portuguese flag company TAP, which uses Groundforce's handling services, but has not affected low cost companies. 
Groundforce workers are demanding that the handling company, which is in serious financial difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, pay wages without any delay and this year's holiday pay. 
The strike mainly affects the operation of Lisbon airport, and has little impact on the remaining 9 Portuguese airports, ANA chief executive Thierry Ligonnière said.
""We still anticipate difficulties tomorrow and a progressive return to normal on Monday,"" Ligonnière told reporters.

Groundforce is 50.1% owned by the Portuguese firm Pasogal and 49.9% by the TAP-Air Portugal group, which in turn is 72.5% controlled by the Portuguese State.
TAP offered to lend the money necessary for Groundforce to pay the holiday pay to its workers, but the proposal was turned down by the handling company.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has previously said its subscription service would generate recurring revenue and expand the customer base for pricy features including lane changing on highways and parking assistance.
But the U.S. electric carmaker reiterated on Saturday that the current features ""do not make the vehicle autonomous,"" adding they ""require a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel.""""FSD capability subscriptions are currently available to eligible vehicles in the United States. Check your Tesla app for updates on availability in other regions,"" Tesla said on its website. 
Tesla's CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said in April that its planned subscription service would generate recurring revenue for the company, although ""there could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term.""
""If ... you look at the number of customers who did not purchase FSD upfront or on a lease and maybe want to experiment with FSD, this is a great option for them,"" he said during an earnings call in April. 
Tesla said the subscription service is available in vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving computer 3.0 or above. It told customers that upgrading to the new hardware will cost $1,500. 

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk forecast in 2019 that robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020. In March, Tesla told a California regulator that it may not achieve full self-driving technology by the end of this year.

China Insurance Security Fund Co Ltd, the state rescue fund for the insurance sector which is controlled by the Ministry of Finance, aims to auction all of its 98.23% stake in Dajia for 33.38 billion yuan. 
China Petrochemical Corp is auctioning its 0.55% stake in Dajia for 186.9 million yuan, according to an auction statement filed to the Beijing Financial Assets Exchange.
The auction will end by Aug. 12.
The move marks the latest development in the restructuring and divestiture of Anbang, which appears to have stalled since February 2020, when the country's top banking and insurance watchdog said Dajia ""was close to a decision on a batch of strategic investors"" and ""would remain privately owned"". (https://reut.rs/3xZNeGN) 
The Chinese government took control of Anbang Insurance Group in February 2018 as part of its sweeping campaign to reduce systemic financial risk after an asset-buying spree by a handful of private-sector conglomerates.

""They're killing people. ... Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people,"" Biden told reporters at the White House when asked about misinformation and what his message was to social media platforms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s.
COVID-19 misinformation has proliferated during the pandemic on social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned YouTube. Researchers and lawmakers have long accused Facebook of failing to police harmful content on its platforms. 
The company has introduced rules against making specific false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines for it, and says it provides people reliable information on these topics.
“We will not be distracted by accusations which aren’t supported by the facts,"" Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister said on Friday. ""The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee has asked the chief executives of six airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) to explain reported worker shortages despite receiving billions in pandemic bailouts.
Congress approved three separate rounds of taxpayer funding totaling $54 billion to pay much of U.S. airlines' payroll costs through Sept. 30 as a result of COVID-19 - as well as $25 billion in low-cost government loans.
Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, sent the airlines letters on Friday asking for answers to detailed questions about ""recent reports of workforce shortages, flight cancellations, and delays, creating havoc and frustrating consumers as more Americans resume travel.""
The Transportation Security Administration said traffic hit almost 2.2 million passengers on Sunday, the highest daily total since February 2020.
In the letters, Cantwell said at best each airline ""poorly managed its marketing of flights and workforce as more people are traveling, and, at worst, it failed to meet the intent of tax payer funding and prepare for the surge in travel that we are now witnessing.""
Airlines were not allowed to issue involuntary layoffs or cut worker pay as part of government assistance.
Cantwell asked the airlines, which also included Republic Airways and Allegiant Airlines, for answers about workforce management, if they have exhausted all U.S. payroll assistance and steps to address anticipated or current labor shortages due to increased consumer flight demand this year.
American Airlines in June said it would cancel around 1% of its flights in July, while Southwest canceled hundreds of flights last month after computer and weather issues.
Southwest said it was the ""only major airline to maintain service at every U.S. airport we served prior to the pandemic"" and did not layoff or furlough any staff.
""We were staffed for what we’re flying and we’re flying for what we staffed,"" a spokeswoman said. 

American and Allegiant declined comment. Republic and JetBlue did not respond to a request for comments.
Delta pointed to Chief Executive Ed Bastian's comments on Wednesday that ""the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing.""

556,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>",U.S. small caps waver as reflation trade wobbles,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations that the U.S. economic rebound will slow in the second half are weighing on small cap stocks, forcing fund managers to look for companies that could continue to profit in a lower growth environment.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, has underperformed the S&P 500 in each of the last four months. Investors pulled nearly $108 million out the iShares Russell 2000 index exchange traded fund during the week that ended July 14, the third straight week of outflows that combined to total nearly $965 million and represent the ETF’s longest losing streak since April.
Small caps stocks have been among the beneficiaries of the so-called reflation trade, which also saw investors bet on shares of banks, energy firms and other economically sensitive companies and lighten up positions in U.S. Treasuries on expectations of a powerful economic rebound. The Russell 2000 is up 11.6% this year, compared to an 16.3% rise for the S&P 500.
Some now believe that bounce has run its course and the economy will slow in coming months, sparking a rotation back into the technology and high-growth stocks that have led markets higher over the last decade. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which move inversely to prices, edged higher Friday but remained near their lowest levels since February. In testimony before Congress earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said rising inflation is likely to be transitory and that the U.S. central bank would continue to support the economy, adding to pressure on yields.
""We have perhaps passed peak inflation fears, and we've also passed peak growth optimism,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.
His firm has been paring its overweight on small caps and is now neutral on the asset class due to expectations that the economic boom from the coronavirus recovery will be short-lived. 
Overall, fund managers have unwound their bullish bets on small caps relative to large caps back to levels last seen in October 2020, before the announcement of effective coronavirus vaccines helped fuel an outsized rally in cyclical and small-cap stocks, according to a global survey of fund managers by BofA Research. 
Low bond yields will likely continue to weigh on small-caps as investors opt for sources of income such as dividend stocks rather than look for capital gains, said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. 
“People are trying to chase any yield that they can and that comes at the expense of small caps. You’ve got this huge demand on the client side for blue chip dividend paying stocks right now because it’s the only place you can get any sort of yield,” he said. 
His firm has not added any new positions in small-caps over the last six months, he said, and has instead added companies such as media giant Viacom Inc to its portfolios. 
Investors will get additional clues as to how broadly the U.S. economy is expanding in the week ahead through data showing new housing starts on Tuesday and an index of leading economic indicators on Thursday.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter, meanwhile, are also expected to release their latest quarterly earnings results in the week ahead, giving investors a deeper read into how the reopening of the economy has affected revenue growth. 
Signs that high inflation will persist longer than the Fed expects could bolster small caps, said Jim Paulsen, Chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. 
Overall, the Russell 2000 should post a 50% growth in earnings over the 2021 fiscal year, compared with a 44% earnings growth in the large-cap S&P 500, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 

That outsized growth rate and high valuations in the S&P 500 could make small caps a contrarian play over the remainder of the year, said Saira Malik, chief investment officer of global equities at Nuveen, who said that she has been adding to financials in expectation that the 10-year Treasury yield will end the year near 2%. 
""We definitely think it will be tougher in the second half, but there will be some permanence to inflation and that would be positive to small caps,"" she said.

""COVID is starting to affect the market, ironically, for the first time since last summer, when the reopening trade began,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Amazon and Apple fell more than 1%. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost 4.2%, and the three companies contributed more than any others to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's declines. The S&P 500 technology sector index lost almost 1%, dipping for a second session after hitting a record on Wednesday.
The utilities index rallied 1%, while the real estate index edged up 0.1% and touched an intraday record high.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 05:46PM ET</span>",FDA investigating how a known carcinogen wound up in J&J sunscreen,"By Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating how a cancer-causing chemical ended up in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) sunscreens, after the company said it had done internal testing and found low levels of benzene in some, the regulator said on Friday.
J&J, which issued a voluntarily recall of the five different Neutrogena and Aveeno brand products, began testing after Valisure - an online pharmacy that tests its products for contaminants - found benzene in dozens of suncare products and asked the FDA to look into it in May.
""The root cause of the benzene found in recalled sunscreen products is the focus of ongoing investigation,"" FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said. ""We will continue to monitor sunscreen manufacturing and marketing to help ensure the availability of safe sunscreens for U.S. consumers.""
On Friday, Valisure Chief Executive David Light said in an interview that he believes the benzene will likely be traced to contaminated raw materials and that he does not believe that the problem is inherent to aerosol sunscreens, or sunscreens in general. ""There's probably the most evidence for raw material contamination,"" Light said. He said that is because the contamination was found in a scattered fashion among brands, and even within brands, suggesting that it was unlikely to be a problem with the chemical or mineral active ingredients.
Valisure also found benzene in products made by other companies than J&J. CVS has halted sales of two of its sunburn healing products, which were in Valisure's petition.

The market for suncare products was around $8 billion globally last year, and J&J sold around $620 million of its brands. In the U.S., the market was around $1.6 billion and J&J's sales were around $290 million, according to EuroMonitor. Shares were flat on Friday at $168.12. Benzene is a chemical frequently used in manufacturing processes to make other chemicals, said Dr. Adam Friedman, a professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University School of Medicine. He said benzene is not a byproduct of sunscreen filters - the various minerals or chemicals used to block the sun's harmful rays. Dr. Joe Schwarcz, a chemistry professor and director of the Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Montreal said in an email that he believed “the risk is minimal because the dose of benzene is too small.” The FDA said that given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen, parents should continue to use broad spectrum sunscreens with SPF 15 or higher. Friedman said several summer camps are collecting all forms of aerosol sun block, not just J&J, including Camp Tawanda in Honsedale, Pennsylvania, his children's sleep away camp, where Friedman is volunteering as camp doctor.
""I have a trunk full of sunscreens for everybody,"" he said.

Ark’s ETFs have been some of the best performing ETFs in 2020, driven by Wood’s bets on “disruptive innovation” in the burgeoning electric vehicles (EV) and biotech industries.
However, investors’ current focus on outdoor stocks that are benefiting from surging reflation trades has caused Wood’s ETFs to decline over the past couple of months.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>","Stocks slide, bond yields dip as inflation worries linger","By Herbert Lash and Simon Jessop
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets ended lower on Friday as investors grappled with fears of rising inflation and a surge in coronavirus cases while the dollar edged higher after upbeat U.S. retail sales data reaffirmed an economy in strong recovery mode.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% in June, contrary to an expected decline, adding weight to those who say inflation will run faster than the Federal Reserve forecasts and force interest rates to rise sooner than it projects.
Yet bond yields pared most initial gains, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note trading at 1.2987%, or a scant 0.2 basis points higher on the day. The Fed's dovish outlook outweighed fears of a prolonged inflation spike.
Equity markets declined as investors turned risk-averse, with defensive stocks gaining both on Wall Street and in Europe. 
MSCI's all-country world index, a gauge of global shares, closed down 0.62% at 719.17. The index scaled a record peak earlier in the week, but lost 0.61% by week's end.
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.38% to 1,754.64. European defensive shares rose, with real estate, utilities and healthcare up between 0.5% and 1% as worries about the coronavirus mounted.
England's coronavirus crisis could return again surprisingly quickly, the British government's chief medical adviser said, before lifting all pandemic-led restrictions on Monday despite rising COVID-19 cases.
In California, Los Angeles county will reimpose a mask mandate this weekend, the latest sign of public health officials struggling with rising cases of the Delta variant.
The slide on Wall Street is surprising given earnings from the companies that have reported second-quarter results so far have surpassed estimates by 22.1%,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
Removing year-ago comparisons show earnings are up decently from levels two years earlier and inflation is likely running about 2.6%, once last year's low baseline is removed, said Jason Pride, chief investment office for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
""That should ultimately be acceptable to the (equity) market and permit an ongoing upward grind,"" Pride said. ""My one hesitation is equity market valuations are high.""
Economically sensitive industrials, energy, financials, consumer discretionary and materials are projected to more than double earnings, while so-called big tech and non-cyclicals are expected to grow 36% and 10%, respectively, Credit Suisse said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.86%, the S&P 500 slid 0.75%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.80%. 
For the week, the Dow lost 0.53%, the S&P 500 fell 0.97% and the Nasdaq shed 1.87%. The S&P 500 real estate index rose to a record high on Friday.
Gold prices dipped as a stronger dollar dulled bullion's appeal, while bond yields were subdued after Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week pledged ""powerful support"" to ensure the U.S. economic recovery does not falter.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, adviser to many of the world's super-rich, said he expected rates to move higher as the recovery fully takes hold.
""We believe the downward trend in yields will reverse as confidence in the economic recovery mounts. However, we see a rebound in 10-year yields to 2% by year-end as consistent with a continued rally in equities.""
In Europe, Germany's 10-year yield fell to a new three-month low in cautious trade ahead of next week's European Central Bank meeting. 
Oil ended the week lower, sapped in volatile trade by expectations of growing supplies just when a rise in coronavirus cases could lead to lockdown restrictions and depress demand.
Brent crude settled down 12 cents at $73.59 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 16 cents to end at $71.81 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% lower at $1,815 an ounce.
In foreign exchange, major currencies were little changed on the day but the dollar headed for its best weekly gain in about a month. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.10% to 92.675.
The euro slid 0.02% at $1.1810, while the yen rose 0.17% at $110.0500.

Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.4%, weighed down by a 1.1% drop in China's blue-chip index and a 0.8% fall for Taiwanese shares.
The Asian weakness was in large part driven by lackluster earnings from TSMC, Asia's biggest firm by market capitalization outside China, which saw its shares fall 4.1%.

561,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 05:00PM ET</span>",4 Under the Radar Energy Stocks to Buy After OPEC Fails to Reach an Agreement,"OPEC's failure to reach an agreement on production levels is driving oil prices higher because demand continues to increase amid the reopening of the global economy, while production remains tight. Given this backdrop, we believe lesser-known energy companies ARC (AETUF), California Resources (NYSE:CRC),  SilverBow  (SBOW), and Goodrich (GDP) should generate substantial returns in the coming months. Let’s discuss.Oil prices are hovering around $75 per barrel with OPEC and its allies failing to reach a deal on their output policy amid a disagreement on the matter between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. While OPEC+ had voted to increase oil production by two million barrels per day beginning in August, the UAE rejected this proposal, leading to an indefinite postponement of talks regarding the cartel’s oil production and output.
Given the rising demand for crude oil on the back of the reopening global economy, oil prices have rallied more than 45% in the first half of 2021 and are likely to hit the $80 per barrel mark soon. Declining inventories amid tight production should allow oil prices to rise further. Current inventory levels are expected to decline by another 100 million barrels by the end of this year to well below pre-pandemic levels. According to Wall Street analysts, oil prices might reach triple digits by next summer.
Thus, we think lesser-known oil exploration companies ARC Resources Ltd. (AETUF), California Resources Corporation (CRC), SilverBow Resources, Inc. (NYSE:SBOW), and Goodrich Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:GDP) should benefit significantly in the coming months.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a three-week winning streak Friday as an unexpected rebound in retail sales pointing to a stronger consumer, and better-than-expected earnings this week were largely cast aside.
The S&P 500 fell 0.75%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.86%, or 299 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.80%.
The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales rose 0.6% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.3% decline. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  climbed 1.1%, well ahead of expectations for a 0.4% rise. 
The data suggest “the consumer is still alive and kicking, and while spending is certainly shifting to services, this is not inducing steep declines in goods demand,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “As for inflation, aside from a few categories (notably autos), surging prices are not deterring consumers just yet.”
Signs that the consumer, which contributes two-thirds of economic growth, continues to spend failed to spark a bid in cyclicals.
Energy led the move lower as oil prices added to losses this week for their biggest weekly loss since May. Oil prices have been on the back foot amid fears major oil producers are set to increase output following a deal by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates earlier this week.
But some suggest that oil demand will continue to outstrip supply. “Even if one factors in the OPEC+ production hike planned in July, this leaves a substantial supply deficit that OPEC+ would need to offset by further expanding production,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Health care stocks, health stocks were in the ascendency, led by a rally in  Moderna .
Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 10% on news that the stock would be included in the S&P 500 as of July 21st.
BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), meanwhile, was up more than 4% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted priority review of the biologics license application of their mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in patients aged 16 years and older.
The bid in big tech seen earlier this week continued to fade, with the Fab 5 closing in the red.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were lower.
Sentiment on stocks this week has also been soured following a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, brought on by the Delta variant. 
“After weeks of declines, seven day average daily deaths have increased by 26% to 211 per day,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during a press briefing Friday.
The gloomy end to the week on Wall Street comes even as the quarterly earnings season got off to an upbeat start.
""Overall, 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q2 2021 to date. Of these companies, 85% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the five-year average of 75%,"" according to FactSet."

Because a $706 billion Pentagon spending bill has been advanced by the House Appropriations Committee on a party-line vote, the aerospace and defense industry is expected to attract investors’ attention in the coming months. Furthermore, the demand for aerospace and defense equipment is increasing as several countries focus more on strengthening their defense capabilities.

This has made the trade quite frustrating for those overweight the sector this year, especially after watching the S&P-500 (SPY) continue to melt higher, unperturbed by the multi-year high inflation figures. The good news is that this continued turbulence in the sector has soured sentiment, forcing many funds to abandon the sector, and many investors to throw in the towel permanently. This exodus has left valuations across the space at very attractive levels for some names, with many miners enjoying 40% plus margins yet trading at 10% plus earnings yields.

While cyclical sectors like the gold miners should never command earnings multiples anywhere near non-cyclical groups in the market given the lack of pricing power they have and the volatility in the commodities they sell. However, even if we assume more reduced earnings multiples of 12-15, most of the sector is now on sale, with many names at dirt-cheap valuations.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has agreed to pay $345 million to resolve claims by consumers who say they overpaid for EpiPens due to anticompetitive practices by the drugmaker and the company that markets the emergency allergy treatment, Mylan (NASDAQ:VTRS).
The proposed class action settlement was disclosed in a filing in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas. The deal, which requires a judge's approval, would not resolve claims against Mylan, which is scheduled to face trial in January.
Paul Geller, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they were ""pleased that Pfizer resolved its part of this class action lawsuit over the pricing of EpiPens.""
Pfizer did not admit wrongdoing. In a statement, the company said that it ""denies any wrongdoing and continues to believe that its actions were appropriate.""
The EpiPen is a handheld device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine.
The litigation followed a public outcry in 2016 after Mylan, which owns the rights to market and distribute the devices, raised the price of a pair of EpiPens to $600, from $100 in 2008, putting it in the center of an ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of medicines.
The lawsuit accused Mylan, which is now part of Viatris Inc, and Pfizer, which manufactured the EpiPen for Mylan, of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that allowed them maintain a monopoly over the market for the devices and their profitable revenues.
U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree last month dismissed much of but not all of the claims against Mylan.

The remaining antitrust claims concern a patent settlement the plaintiffs say delayed the launch of a generic epinephrine auto-injector. Mylan has said it ""firmly believes that Mylan's conduct was lawful and pro-competitive.""
Mylan in 2017 agreed to pay $465 million to resolve U.S. Justice Department claims it overcharged the government for the EpiPen.

VMware (NYSE:VMW), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), and Macy's (M) are examples of names that possess high short interest and are being discussed on social media. Because of this, we think these stocks could witness a solid rally in the near term. Read on.The short squeeze wave, which took the stock market by storm earlier this year, drove sky-rocketing rallies by  GameStop Corp . (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC), among other meme stocks. The retail trading frenzy has been continuing into this summer. According to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), retail traders account for 10% of the United States’ stock trading volume.
With improving advanced technology and access to zero-commission trading platforms, retail traders are expected to take more control of the market.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>","Yellen began Treasury job with flurry of calls and meetings, calendar shows","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen began her new job with a packed schedule of calls and meetings with high-powered American political and business leaders and global finance officials, a calendar of her first two months in office shows.
As is custom for her new role, Yellen had calls with other finance ministers around the world from January through March, according to her calendar, which was made public on Friday. The United States was still near the beginning of its economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic during that time as vaccinations ramped up and widespread restrictions to curb cases began to ease.
But she also made time to have calls with several business executives, including two whose industries have been hard hit by the pandemic: Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX), chief executive officer of United Airlines, and Greg Smith, the chief financial officer of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
The former Federal Reserve chief also had calls with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Ronald O'Hanley, CEO of  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). Both firms were assigned roles in helping to administer emergency programs set up by the U.S. central bank to help financial markets last year.
The incoming Biden administration pushed in the first two months of the year for a $1.9 trillion aid package to boost the economic recovery. The legislation was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in March.
Yellen was a strong supporter of the stimulus package, and her diary showed she had calls with several lawmakers over the reporting period as well as one with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Yellen also had two meetings with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, one in February and the other in March. The Treasury department set up a new ""climate hub"" in April to foster green finance and use tax policy and financial risk assessments to help reduce carbon emissions.
And in keeping with her reputation as a meticulous preparer for events, Yellen carved out several pockets for ""read time"" ahead of various meetings, her calendar showed.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Friday as a surprise rebound in retail sales and better-than-expected earnings weren’t enough to coax the bulls out from hiding.
The S&P 500 fell 0.20%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.43%, or 151 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.32%.
The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales rose 0.6% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.3% decline. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  climbed 1.1%, well ahead of expectations for a 0.4% rise. 
The data suggest “the consumer is still alive and kicking, and while spending is certainly shifting to services, this is not inducing steep declines in goods demand,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “As for inflation, aside from a few categories (notably autos), surging prices are not deterring consumers just yet.”
Signs that the consumer, which contributes two-thirds of economic growth, continues to spend failed to spark a bid in cyclicals.
Energy led the move lower as oil prices added to losses this week and remain on pace for their biggest weekly loss since May. Oil prices have been on the backfoot amid fears of major oil producers are set to increase output following a deal by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates earlier this week.
But some suggest that the oil demand will continue to outstrip supply. “Even if one factors in the OPEC+ production hike planned in July, this leaves a substantial supply deficit that OPEC+ would need to offset by further expanding production,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
But health care stocks were in the ascendency, led by a rally in  Moderna .
Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped nearly 8% on news that the stock would be included in the S&P 500 as of July 21st.
BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), meanwhile, was up more than 3% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted priority review of the biologics license application of their mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in patients aged 16 years and older.
The bid in big tech seen earlier this week continued to fade, with the Fab 5, with exception of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, mostly lower.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were lower.
Sentiment on stocks have also been soured this week following a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, brought on by the Delta variant. Covid deaths are on the rise again following weeks of decline.
“After weeks of declines, seven day average daily deaths have increased by 26% to 211 per day,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during a press briefing Friday.

So, instead, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of the big tech companies Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) because these companies are well-positioned to capitalize on industry tailwinds.One of the top customer relationship management companies, San Francisco-based Salesforce.com, Inc.

And on June 23, the company also announced a significant expansion of its global strategic partnership with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud segment—Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS)—on June 23. However, the stock has lost 2.1% over the past month and 7.8% over the past nine months to close yesterday’s trading session at $237.58.
On June 30, CRM announced the pricing of an offering of $8 billion of senior notes, the proceeds from which it expects to use to partially fund fees, costs, and expenses related to the acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WORK), among other uses. Analysts expect its EPS to decline 36.8% for the current quarter ending July 31, 2021, and 22.6% in 2022. But, given its weak earnings outlook, the stock looks overvalued at the current price level. In terms of forward EV/S and P/S, CRM’s respective 8.31x and 8.47x are higher than the 4.14x and 3.96x industry averages. However, the tech industry has immense growth potential given the increasing use of advanced technologies across most of the sectors. The increasing demand for IoT and AI-based products and services is further expected to drive the industry forward.
While CRM may not be a good bet right now, we think that one could cash in on the tech industry’s solid growth by betting on established players Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ), which have immense upside potential.

(Reuters) -Italy's Stevanato Group S.p.A. made a tepid debut on the New York Stock Exchange as its shares slid, giving the world's second largest glass vial maker a valuation of $5 billion. 
Stevanato's shares fell more than 20% to open at $16.65 on Friday. The company had priced its initial public offering (IPO) of 32 million shares, down from 40 million shares earlier, at the lower end of its target range of $21 to $24 per share. 
The maker of COVID-19 vaccines vials and other healthcare products raised about $672 million in its IPO on Thursday. 
""IPO is the best way to further finance the business...most of the proceeds of the IPO, we are going to invest in the new greenfield plants, one in Indiana, and one in China,"" said Franco Stevanato, executive chairman of the company's board.
The company saw demand for its products and service go up due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides vials to about 90% of currently marketed COVID-19 vaccine programs, according to Stevanato's estimates. 
Majority of the company's total revenue comes from its biopharmaceutical and diagnostic solutions segment that makes vials, cartridges and drug delivery systems, among others, according to a recent filing by the company.

The medical packaging company, originally founded as specialty glass manufacturer by billionaire Sergio Stevanato in 1949, has more than 700 customers, including 41 of the top 50 pharmaceuticals companies, the filing showed.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) were the lead underwriters for the offering.

So, let’s discuss these names.As the major global economies witness a robust recovery following a devastating pandemic-induced recession, luxury retail stores and online platforms are expected to see a substantial growth in sales on the back of a surge in discretionary spending. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged at an annual rate of 11.4% in the first three months of 2021.
Because consumers are diving into retail shopping again and physical stores are returning to operational full capacity, luxury retailers are expected to generate solid sales growth. With more luxury brands embracing e-commerce platforms to boost their sales amid shifting consumer tastes and preferences, they are expected to benefit significantly.
Given the spending tsunami as the economy ramps up, we think luxury retailers Burberry Group plc (OTC:BURBY), Hugo Boss AG (BOSSY), and  Signet Jewelers Limited  (SGI) are well-positioned to benefit. So, these stocks could be solid bets now.

Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back-to-office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank's U.S. staff working from home will begin returning to office from Sept. 7 and the process will continue through October, Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell told employees in a memo seen by Reuters. Returns to office will be organized by job function and location.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase.
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
CEO Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) 
The bank's chief executive officer, James Gorman, said if most employees are not back to work at the bank's Manhattan headquarters in September, he will be ""very disappointed"".
Gorman said his bank's policy will vary by location, noting the firm's 2,000 employees in India will not return to offices this year. 
The bank's staff and clients will not be allowed to enter its New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated, according to a source familiar with the matter. Employees, clients, and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access the bank's offices in New York and Westchester, the source said.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) 
The lender expects all of its vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day in early September, and will then focus on developing plans to bring back unvaccinated workers to its sites, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told https://bloom.bg/3gyALn3 Bloomberg News in an interview. 
UNITED KINGDOM

CEO Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. 
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC)
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40% as it moves to a hybrid working model for most employees. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) 
Britain's biggest domestic bank is hoping to resume office-based trials and experiments with around 5,000 of its staff this summer, once government restrictions allow. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
NatWest 
CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) 
Deutsche Bank in London plans to bring more staff back from June 21, assuming the city's lockdown restrictions are loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Germany's largest lender has also told its investment bankers in the U.S. that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.
SWITZERLAND
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
Credit Suisse in July 2020 launched a global program evaluating various work-from-home options, which are expected to shape its post-pandemic working models. It has been monitoring and adapting work arrangements since launching work-from-home globally in March 2020, taking into account local guidelines.
UBS
UBS Chairman Axel Weber in May said flexibility would remain part of work arrangements at Switzerland's biggest bank going forward, where roles allow. Return to office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines.
CANADA

Investing.com – Xiaomi (OTC:XIACY) stock rose 4% Friday on a report showing the Chinese company overtook Apple in the second quarter to be the world’s second-largest smartphone maker.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock dipped 0.5%.
According to analyst firm Canalys, South Korea’s Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) continued to be the largest smartphone maker, with its second-quarter market share at 19%, ahead of Xiaomi’s 17% and Apple’s 14%.
Oppo and Vivo came next, with 10% market share each.
Xiaomi’s shipments grew 83%, with Oppo’s a distant second at 28%. Samsung’s shipments grew 15% and Apple’s 1%.
Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton noted the Chinese manufacturer’s phones are still largely skewed toward the mass market. Its average selling price is around 75% cheaper than Apple, he said.
Stanton said a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra, “but it will be a tough battle, with Oppo and Vivo sharing the same objective, and both willing to spend big on above-the-line marketing to build their brands in a way that Xiaomi is not”.

LONDON (Reuters) - John Elkann, scion of Italy's Agnelli family, has been exploring a possible tie up with fashion designer Giorgio Armani as part of a plan to build a luxury conglomerate potentially anchored around Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Elkann, who chairs Franco-Italian car group Stellantis, offered to buy a minority stake in the Milanese fashion house led by 87-year old Giorgio Armani, but his latest proposal was rebuffed earlier this month, two of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The deal would have established the Agnellis as major players in the fashion industry alongside the Arnaults and Pinaults in France.
Discussions with Armani - which is valued by analysts at about 6 billion euros ($7.09 billion) - did not progress due to the designer's reluctance to sell, two of the sources said, adding talks were informal and no bank was involved.
A spokesperson for Elkann and the Agnelli family holding company Exor (OTC:EXXRF) said: ""Exor has made no approach and Exor has made no proposal (for Armani).""
Armani declined to comment.
A possible deal with Armani would have been crafted through investment firm Exor or Exor-controlled carmaker Ferrari – but Elkann's latest offer was rejected, the sources said.
""Discussions are dead for now,"" one of the sources said.
The move reflects efforts by the founders of Fiat Chrysler - who own 53% of Exor - to expand beyond the car industry and increase their exposure to the luxury market after a series of recent investments.
Exor took a 24% stake in Christian Louboutin in March in a deal that valued the French brand, most famous for its signature red lacquered sole stilettos, at 2.25 billion euros.
In June, it entered a partnership with Hong Kong's The World-Wide Investment Company to support medium-sized Italian companies focused on high-end consumer goods. Last year, it became the largest shareholder in Chinese luxury group Shang Xia, which was co-founded by France's Hermes.
""If there is someone who could create a serious competitor to the French conglomerates, it's Elkann,"" said one banker familiar with his strategy.
""He has the money, credibility and family prestige to do that.""

Speculation about succession plans at the fashion house founded in 1975 by Armani, known as King Giorgio, has been heating up.
The brand, which is famous for its elegant suits and evening gowns, is expected to draw interest from French luxury companies LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), sources at the groups told Reuters, although they said Armani did not want to sell to a foreign group.
Armani told U.S. magazine Vogue in April that he could consider joining forces with another Italian company, opening the door to a possible business partner for the first time.
He said the COVID-19 crisis had ""made us open our eyes a bit.""
The Milanese fashion house, whose net revenues grew 2.3% to 2.16 billion euros in 2019 after three years of declines, has yet to release its 2020 earnings. 
The company is one of Italy's trophy assets and its valuation - which hovers at about three times its sales - could even hit 8 billion euros, one Milan-based analyst said.
Armani, who has no children, set up a foundation in 2016 that would serve as a succession tool, preventing his business from being bought or broken up after his death.

In June, after showcasing his latest menswear collection, he hinted at succession plans, saying he was preparing his future with his closest aides.

(Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it has barred the company that operates Hawaiian cargo airline Transair from flying or conducting maintenance inspections until it complies with U.S. regulations. 
The agency’s decision is separate from an ongoing investigation into the July 2 accident involving a Transair Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-200 that crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Honolulu. Both of the aircraft's two crew members were rescued. 
The FAA said it began investigating maintenance and safety practices of Rhoades Aviation Inc last fall. The FAA said that as of Thursday, Transair had one operational Boeing 737-200. 
Rhoades Aviation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On June 13, the FAA notified Rhoades Aviation the agency intended to rescind authority for the airline to conduct maintenance inspections due to deficiencies identified during the investigation. The FAA gave the company 30 days under the administrative process to ask the FAA to reconsider, which it did not do.
Last week investigators located Transair Flight 810 approximately two miles offshore from Ewa Beach in Honolulu. The 737-200 was about 45 years old.
The major components of the airplane - the aft fuselage including both wings and tail along with both engines, and forward fuselage - were located on the sea floor at depths between 360 and 420 feet, the National Transportation Safety Board.

Given the bullish market sentiment as physical retail shopping gradually regains its appeal, we think leading apparel retail stocks The Gap (GPS) and Carter’s (CRI) could be solid bets now. Read on.While the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant constraint for apparel retailers last year, the industry has been gradually recovering thanks to a substantial uptick in consumer spending on apparel and a growing trend in customized clothing and athleisure. The U.S. economy’s rapid recovery, and the relaxation of social distancing restrictions, have increased foot traffic in retail stores markedly of late.
As apparel retailers continue to digitize their businesses, redesign their stores and renew their product offerings, they are well-positioned to capitalize on consumers’ increased spending funded by discretionary budget savings last year. Consequently, the global apparel market is expected to hit $842.7 billion in 2025, growing at a 9.8% CAGR.
Thus, with their established retail chains and a digital presence, we believe apparel retail stocks The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) and Carter’s Inc. (CRI) would be wise bets now because they might witness a solid increase in sales going forward.

(Reuters) - Houston Astros fans struck out in their quest for ticket refunds over the Major League Baseball team's sign-stealing scandal, when a Texas state appeals court found they had no legal basis to collect damages.
Reversing a lower court judge, the 14th Court of Appeals in Houston said on Thursday that buying tickets gave fans merely a right to watch games in person, not a right to have games played honestly or for the Astros to live up to their ""Earn History"" slogan.
The plaintiffs accused the Astros of overcharging for full and partial season tickets from 2016 to 2019 by concealing how its players stole pitch signs from opposing catchers, including in 2017, when the team won the World Series.
An MLB probe found in January 2020 that Astros employees watched a feed from a center field camera to decode signs, and banged on a trash can to tell batters what pitches to expect.
The Texas court found the proposed class action similar to a New York Jets fan's case against the New England Patriots over that National Football League team's secret videotaping of signals from Jets coaches, in the ""Spygate"" scandal.
A federal appeals court dismissed that lawsuit in 2010.
""The plaintiffs' claims arise from the way the Astros played the game and the plaintiffs' 'embarrassment, disappointment, shame, and disgrace,'"" the Texas court said. ""Claims based on how a sports team plays the game are not cognizable.""

Bob Hilliard, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients plan to appeal the three-judge panel's decision.
""Cheaters win,"" he said in an email on Friday. ""The Astros' sign-stealing cheating scandal and the damages incurred by the season ticket-holders... were the result of a meticulous pre-game, off-field commitment and goal-oriented determination. A widespread scandal to defraud consumers.""
The Astros fired manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow after MLB suspended them for one year because of the scandal. Hinch now manages the Detroit Tigers. "

Investors should keep them on their radars as they have massive long-term potential.Norms and regulations in society can change in the span of a few generations. We’ve lived through this with the rise of the cannabis industry. A few decades ago, most people were against its use for recreational and medicinal purposes. Today, medical marijuana has nearly unanimous approval, while a majority are in favor of its legalization for recreational use. 
We may be now going through the same process with psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA. There has been promising research and evidence that these substances can help with mental illnesses and anxiety in a much more effective way than traditional treatments with fewer side effects. Further, psychedelics have the power to help at a much more root-cause level than merely treat symptoms.
Research and clinical trials are being conducted using these substances, while state legislatures in more liberal enclaves are considering its legalization for medicinal purposes. Last year, Oregon became the first state to legalize its use for medical use. Investors are also starting to pay attention as there is significant commercial potential. 3 stocks that are working on developing treatments from psychedelics are ATAI Life Sciences N.V (ATAI), Compass Pathways Plc (CMPS), and Mind Medicine Holdings (MNMD).

David Cohne has scanned the list to find his top three stocks which include Apple (AAPL), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Robinhood has been in the news lately for a couple of different reasons. First, the company is looking to go public and recently filed a Form S-1. Companies file this form to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before they go public. From this form, we learned that Robinhood had a great quarter.
Robinhood had 18 million net cumulative funded accounts by the end of the first quarter, a 44% jump from the end of 2020. This means that the company is doing quite well, and it continues to gain traction with a younger investor audience.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's big retailers are working round the clock to replenish shelves with food in hundreds of stores looted this week in some of the country's worst unrest for years, they said on Friday.
Retailers also said they are racing to keep stores unaffected by the violence stocked as some shoppers were stripping shelves with panic buying, though blocked roads and disruptions to supply chains were hampering their efforts.
Retailers were just starting to recover from months of coronavirus restrictions when the violence triggered by the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma erupted and the looting could now set them back several months.
Massmart, which is majority owned by U.S. retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, said protesters had looted 41 of its stores and two of its distribution centres, with four sites suffering significant damage from arson.
TFG, the owner of Foschini clothing and @home chains, said 190 stores had been looted and damaged to varying degrees. All its stores in KwaZulu-Natal province are shut.
""The timeline to reopen will be quick in some locations whilst in others it will be dependent on the nature and extent of the damage and on the availability of the relevant resources and supply chains,"" TFG said.
Pepkor, which is majority owned by Steinhoff International, said 489 stores, representing about 9% of its retail outlets, had been damaged and looted as well as one of the JD (NASDAQ:JD) Group's distribution centres in KwaZulu-Natal. 
Pepkor's supply chain and distribution operations in the affected areas have been severely disrupted, it said.
All three retailers, as well as grocery chains Pick n Pay, Shoprite and SPAR Group, whose 184 stores were looted and vandalised, said the priority was to replenish shelves as concerns about food shortages mount.
SPAR trucks were dispatched on Friday with security escorts and the chain said it would try to restock all its KwaZulu-Natal stores open for business over the weekend.

Woolworths said it was working closely with suppliers to make sure its stores were stocked.
""This is largely dependent on the reopening of key transport routes, the ability of local suppliers to continue production, the ability of our staff to access our stores and the safety of our logistics and distribution operations,"" it said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks started Friday on a strong note, with all three main indices rising after retail sales data for June showed the U.S. consumer still spending freely. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. They're on track for their fourth straight weekly gain. 
Earlier, the Census Bureau said retail sales had risen by 0.6% in June, well ahead of the 0.4% decline expected. May's data were revised to show a drop of 1.7%, slightly larger than the one originally reported. The figures showed spending on food services continuing to rise strongly, while sales of autos weakened amid a shortage of available cars due supply chain problems.
James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, said the numbers point to continued retail sales growth in the coming months, despite the fact that economic reopening will give consumers more freedom to spend on experiences and services that aren't captured by the data. ""After all, consumer finances remain in great shape with incomes picking up and credit card borrowing having been paid down,"" Kinghtley said.
However, the subsequent release of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey also showed that people are starting to fret about inflation, which hit its highest rate in over 12 years in June. Expectations for inflation over the next year rose to 4.8% from 4.2% a month ago. The survey's main sentiment index fell, surprisingly, to its lowest level since January.
In early dealings,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock stood out with a 6.3% leap to a new record high after news that it will be included in the S&P 500 from next week, replacing Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN). 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock also stood out, rising 1.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it is in talks to buy chipmaker GlobalFoundries for some $30 billion. That would be Intel's biggest ever acquisition and a big step towards its aim of becoming a major supplier of chips to other semiconductor companies.
Elsewhere, Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) inched lower after reports of a large-scale visit to its office from various government agencies carrying out the review into its data policies. However, they were comfortably off their premarket lows.  Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) ADRs (NASDAQ:ERIC) fell 9.8% meanwhile, after a disappointing quarterly update that showed it losing ground in the market for 5G networks in China. It's on course for a 7% drop this week, while Nokia (NYSE:NOK), its big Finnish rival, is up over 5% after reporting better numbers.
On the downside, Membership Collective  (NYSE:MCG), the company behind the Soho House chain of private members' clubs, fell another 6.9% after a drop of nearly 10% on its debut on Thursday. The loss-making company had priced its IPO at the bottom of the marketing range earlier in the week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Friday it was recalling about 775,000 Ford Explorer SUVs worldwide for a steering issue linked to reports of six injuries in North America.
The recall covers 2013-2017 model year vehicles that may experience a seized cross-axis ball joint that could cause a fractured rear-suspension toe link, which could significantly diminish steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.
The recall covers 676,152 vehicles in North America, 59,935 in China and 38,600 elsewhere. The U.S. vehicles are in high-rust states.
Owner notifications will begin in late August. Dealers will inspect cross-axis ball joints and replace if needed and replace the toe links with a revised part.
Ford issued two other small recalls on Friday, nearly all of them in North America. One is for about 35,000 2020-2021 Ford F-350 Super Duty vehicles with 6.7-liter engines and single rear wheel axle for a rear-axle housing spring seat interface weld issue.

Ford is also recalling 41,000 2020-2021 Lincoln Aviator vehicles equipped with 3.0-liter gas engines because the battery cable wire harness may not be properly secured.
The issue could result in a short circuit and potential fire. Ford is not aware of any accidents, injuries or fires related to the two smaller recalls.

Investing.com – Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) stock slid 8% in Friday’s premarket trading as the company warned of its market share weakening in China amid the ongoing tensions between the world’s second largest economy and the West.
The company was expecting big orders from Chinese carriers for deploying 5G networks, but with the acrimony showing no signs of abating Ericsson has tempered its hopes. China is the world’s largest market for 5G services.
Sweden, Ericsson’s home country, last year joined other European nations in banning Chinese telecom equipment makers, like Huawei and ZTE (OTC:ZTCOY), from supplying their gear in the country.
Ericsson now stares at a quid-pro-quo, if not formally, at least materially.
Ericsson’s second-quarter sales in China fell by 2.5 billion Swedish crown ($290 million), the first drop in three years, according to Reuters.
China’s share in the company’s second-quarter sales fell to 3% from 9% in the same period last year.
Asked on an analyst call if Ericsson expected to recoup that money, Chief Executive Borje Ekholm replied: ""No, it's not coming back,"" Reuters said.
Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander told the news agency it was ""prudent to forecast materially lower market share"" in the future.
Overall, Ericsson’s earnings per share rose 49% on an 8% jump in net sales.

Revenue rose to $749.5 million in the second quarter, in line with the average analyst estimate of $750.08 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The smallest of the six Class 1 railroads by revenue, Kansas City's carload volumes rose 31% in the three months ended June 30.
The company reported a net loss of $378 million, or $4.17 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $110.3 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. 
The loss was in part due to a $700 million break-up fee it owed to  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd.

Kansas City's $33.6 billion merger with Canadian National is being scrutinized by regulatory authorities. 
Adjusted operating ratio, a key profitability metric for Wall Street, was 61.4%, compared with 65.2% a year earlier.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 08:21AM ET</span>",Small miners aim for European supply chain for electric vehicles independent from China,"By Clara Denina and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Growing demand for electric vehicles has spurred small-scale miners of the lithium, cobalt and rare earths that automakers rely on to develop mines and build refining capacity in Europe to reduce their reliance on China.
Efforts by the United States and Europe to build a secure and independent supply chain for the key minerals used in electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines and aircraft engines have accelerated as the pandemic led to shutdowns and shortages.
With companies under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint, processing metals into goods that are circulated within the continent and do not have to travel far is an environmental goal. 
At least four smaller companies are building facilities to process ore in Europe's special economic zones over the next five years, with more planning to build mines on the continent and process materials on site, company officials said.
Mkango Resources, a rare earth developer with projects in Malawi, is working with chemicals company Grupa Azoty Pulawy to build a separation plant in Poland's Special Economic Zone, benefiting from tax exemptions and state aid.
""The site... aligns with European initiatives to create more robust, diversified supply chains,"" said Mkango Resources CEO William Dawes.
Rare earths, such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, are used to make magnets to fire EV engines and operate windows, offshore wind turbines and other high-tech devices. China currently provides 98% of the world's supply.
Europe is home to automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW Group, Stellantis  Renault  (PA:RENA), as well as suppliers of automotive components, who are under pressure from regulators to source materials within the region.
EU ""rules of origin"", which determine where goods have been manufactured or produced, stipulate that 65% of the value of a product will need to be locally sourced from 2027 to qualify for tariff-free movement of goods within the bloc.
Relocating from low-cost jurisdictions such as Asia carries risks, said Craig Scherba, president of graphite developer NextSource Materials, which has a project in Madagascar and plans a battery anode facility, with Europe one of the possible locations. 
""Those that can maintain low costs will survive,"" he said.
Elsewhere, rare earths developer Pensana Plc, which owns assets in Angola, is building a plant to purify the metals in Britain, using the UK government's Automotive Transformation Fund, which awards grants to accelerate the transition to a net-zero vehicle supply chain.
""There are a number of incentives which have been put in place,"" said Pensana Chairman Paul Atherley.
The Saltend plant had lower capital expenditure and operating costs than at comparable sites in Europe, he said.
Saltend is in the Humber ports region which has freeport status, making arriving goods exempt from tariffs. 
Pensana has so far secured 15 million pounds ($20.96 million) through an equity raise for the $125 million plant which will create about 100 jobs. 
For the local community, new jobs are welcome, but union representatives say that British industry will also have to invest in training workers. 
Australia's Infinity Lithium is seeking to develop the San Jose Industrial Lithium Project in Spain, an open-pit mine that aims to also treat and refine onsite.
NeoMetals, another Australian firm, is planning a lithium recycling plant in Germany. 
For major miners, who deal with much bigger tonnage, building facilities in Europe is generally uneconomical but some are making the move.
Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) is looking at European processing plants, including in Britain, for their recycling operations, while Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) plans to have a processing facility onsite at its Serbian lithium mine Jadar, expected to start a feasibility study at the end of 2021. 
Part of the role so-called junior miners serve in the industry is to de-risk projects and undertake the early development works, which in some cases leads to acquisition by larger miners, said Caspar Rawles at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI).

Investing.com –  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) and Richemont (SIX:CFR) were trading lower in Friday’s premarket as worries about top level reshuffle outweighed positive first-quarter performances by the two retailers.
Burberry stock was down 4% in London and  Richemont  stock 2% in Switzerland.
The U.K.-based fashion group, known for its trenchcoats and distinctive check trademark pattern, will see its Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti return home to Italy at the end of 2021 to steer Salvatore Ferragamo (OTC:SFRGY).
Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown told Reuters Gobbetti's announcement had come as a surprise, but it was ""very much a personal decision"". Gobbetti had sought to elevate Burberry in the luxury sector.
Investors fear Riccardo Tisci, whom Gobbetti brought in to revitalize the brand, could also follow his boss but Brown said the designer remains committed.
A broader reshuffle is taking place at the maker of Cartier and Baume & Mercier watches.
Richemont said the chief executives of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and fashion and accessories would leave the senior executive committee to solely focus on their businesses. They will no longer be on the board of the company but continue to report to Chairman Johann Rupert.
Attributing the changes to the ongoing pandemic and the continued acceleration of ‘new retail’, the company said the committee would focus on strategic matters and the executives on customers. The changes come into effect September 8.
Burberry said retail revenue for the 13 weeks to June 26 rose 86% year-on-year to 479 million pounds ($662 million). Comparable store sales rose 90% from the same period last year. The retailer retained its outlook.
Richemont's sales rose 129% to 4.40 billion euro ($5.19 billion) in the June quarter."

Autoliv reported an operating profit of $164 million compared with a $234 million loss in the year-ago quarter, lagging a mean forecast for a $186 million profit based on a poll of analysts published by the company.
While the demand recovery from the market plunge in the early months of the pandemic has been strong, a global shortage of semiconductors has hit the automotive sector hard, forcing many car makers to curtail production plans.
Autoliv's Sweden-listed shares fell 5.2% by 1219 GMT. Chief Executive Mikael Bratt said in a statement that the lower than expected light vehicle production (LVP) had impacted the company's sales and profitability in the quarter.
""Although the situation improved towards the end of the quarter, we still expect supply disruptions to impact LVP negatively in the third quarter with some improvement in the fourth quarter,"" he said. 
Bratt told Reuters there had been few clear signs the semiconductor shortage, which has also seen Autoliv step in to aid its own suppliers in their efforts to source chips, was set to be significantly redressed in the near term. 
""Our best estimate right now is that quarter two was the worst point of this challenge,"" Bratt said. ""It's difficult to know the exact lead times for this problem, but I wouldn't rule out that it will have some impact also heading into 2022.""
The rival of ZF and Joyson Safety Systems lowered its 2021 guidance for like-for-like sales growth to 16-18% from around 20% and also scaled back its forecast for profitability while flagging steepening raw material costs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU competition regulators will investigate whether a 3.2-billion-euro ($3.8 billion) restructuring plan for ailing Portuguese airline TAP is proportionate and complies with EU state aid rules, the European Commission said on Friday.
The overhaul plan involves around 2,000 job cuts by 2022, pay cuts of up to 25%, a reduced fleet and the sale of non-core assets.
The EU watchdog said it would investigate whether TAP or market operators would provide a sufficient contribution to the restructuring cost and also whether measures would be adopted to offset any negative impact on competition.
The Commission also re-adopted an earlier decision clearing a 1.2-billion-euro rescue loan for TAP after Europe's second-highest court in May annulled its approval because regulators had not provided adequate reasons. 
Rival Ryanair had challenged the TAP rescue loan, which forms part of the 3.2 billion euro restructuring aid and will be converted into equity.
Portugal's infrastructure ministry said the EU probe would focus on assessing the compatibility of the aid with the rules for supporting companies in difficulty.

""This is an important step for the European Commission to make more solid, namely from a legal point of view, the solutions that may be found to ensure the future viability of TAP without dependence on public resources,"" the ministry said in a statement.

It said this strategy was starting to bear fruit amid a recovery in demand, although its latest figures reflect sales by volume only. 
""In an environment still disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Renault Group sold 1,422,600 vehicles in the first half of 2021, up 18.7% on 2020, but down 24.2% on the first half of 2019,"" the group said in a statement.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",The Warthog and the senator: The politics of retiring a warplane,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force is desperate to get rid of some of its fleet of expensive, slow and outdated A-10 Warthog airplanes, but politicians have blocked the move, aiming to keep the local dollars flowing.
President Joe Biden wants to retire dozens of the 40-year-old warplanes to free up funding to modernize the military. But within weeks of the release of his proposed defense budget, Democrats drafted a law to keep the planes, many of which are based in Arizona, where Senator Mark Kelly is up for re-election in 2022.
The negotiations over the A-10, which the Air Force has wanted to retire for more than two decades, show the extensive measures Democrats will take to protect their slim majority in the Senate.
Having military aircraft based in a constituency brings enormous economic benefit. The A-10 fleet at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson has been viewed as vital to the base, which contributes about $3 billion to the local economy and is among the region's top employers, former Tucson Mayor Thomas Volgy said.
Kelly wrote to the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 9 to request $272 million ""to restore all funding to the A-10 program"" in fiscal 2022 and $615 million to buy new wings to rewing the portion of the A-10 fleet that had been earmarked for retirement.
He also spoke to Democratic Senator Jack Reed, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who in turn prohibited any A-10 retirements in his draft of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, annual legislation that sets defense policy, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The NDAA is a long way from becoming law, but items added by the chairman in the draft are difficult to strike, or weaken with an amendment. 
Democrats hold a tenuous majority in the 50-50 Senate thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote, meaning they cannot afford to lose even one seat in the chamber. 
Kelly faces up to seven potential Republican competitors in the race to keep his seat. Mothballing about a fifth of the A-10 fleet would be a significant symbolic blow that local officials fear would foreshadow a longer-term plan to eliminate the planes completely - and could weaken Kelly's candidacy.
""We all know that the A-10 had been on the chopping block for some time. It has taken a Herculean effort by elected officials to keep the A-10 in the Air Force's inventory,"" Volgy said.
Kelly opposes ""retiring A-10s without a suitable replacement to carry out the close air support mission that is critical to our national security and protecting American troops,"" a spokesperson told Reuters.
The A-10 has been on the chopping block for many years because it is old - it was first deployed in 1976 - and because it competes with attack helicopters for the best way to provide air support to frontline troops. 
While the Air Force plans to install a larger contingent of military personnel at the base once the A-10s are retired - eclipsing the economic fallout from mothballing the planes - Kelly could be blamed for letting some planes go under his watch.
Kelly is seen as among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2022, along with Georgia's Raphael Warnock. 
The former astronaut and husband of gun-control activist Gabrielle Giffords defeated Republican Senator Martha McSally in a special election last November. But he is up for re-election next year because he is finishing the term of the late Republican Senator John McCain, who also supported retaining the A-10 fleet before he died in 2018.
The funds saved by retiring the planes would go to Air Force

modernization projects like the development of hypersonic weapons. At the same time, Air Force Lieutenant General David Nahom said at a House of Representatives hearing this week that if the number of A-10s is not reduced this year, the Air Force will face a shortage of mechanics for newer planes.
Volgy, currently a University of Arizona professor, said the question is not just about the A-10, ""but making sure Davis-Monthan will remain stable.""

BOSTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Hiromichi Mizuno's connections, spanning from the Japanese government to Harvard University, made him a guiding voice among climate-focused investors worldwide.
Now those ties have placed his own conduct under scrutiny after an independent report focused on Mizuno's role in alleged collusion between the management of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and Japan's trade ministry to block foreign investors from gaining board influence at the conglomerate. 
The revelations helped lead to the ouster of Toshiba’s chairman last month.
Mizuno said in a recent interview that he put no pressure on Harvard and only volunteered to help the endowment understand how things worked in Japan. He and government officials have challenged the report's conclusions and said it does not reflect Mizuno's account. [nL2N2O503S]
The dispute highlights the tension between the two strands of Mizuno's career - the champion of sustainable investment and the government insider - at a time when foreign shareholders are trying to judge Japan's receptivity to overseas investment.
Abby Adlerman, an adviser to corporate boards and CEO of Boardspan, a provider of corporate governance software, said it would have been better if Mizuno had recused himself from the talks at Harvard. ""All of this recognition and access to information means he is pulled in different directions as to his loyalties and has responsibilities to many parties,"" she said. 
The current situation, she said, is ""shuttle diplomacy gone bad.""
Mizuno said he only volunteered to help university officials as a part of the Harvard community, where he was about to start an academic fellowship.
“I did what I could to help both Harvard and the Japanese government"" make informed decisions, he said.
PUSHING MANAGERS
The report's description of a powerful government insider throwing his weight around contrasts with the civic-minded persona that Mizuno cultivated as chief investment officer of Japan's $1.6 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and burnished as a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc director.
Mizuno earned an MBA from Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University and joined the GPIF in 2015 from London-based private equity firm Coller Capital.
The post gave him a platform to become a prominent voice pushing for considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in investment decisions.
But his approach caused friction with people concerned GPIF would become actively involved with the Japanese stock market or push beyond its enabling legislation, according to a Harvard Business School case study about his efforts.
Mizuno left the GPIF last year but retained his government connection as a special adviser at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), holding the position until being named a United Nations special envoy on sustainable investment in December.
""He's got a style which is not traditional, and that sometimes makes people uncomfortable. But he's perceived by the international crowd as an important champion of ESG practices, and that makes him a hero outside of Japan,"" said Alicia Ogawa, who leads a center focused on Japanese corporate governance at Columbia University. 
'SOMEONE WITH CONNECTIONS'
Mizuno's academic fellowship was at Harvard Business School, distinct from Harvard Management Co., or HMC, which runs the university's $41 billion endowment. HMC held a 4% Toshiba stake, one of the single largest chunks of shares, which drew Toshiba's attention when it sought to lobby investors against outside director candidates last summer.
The company also sought intervention from METI, which could use new foreign investment rules to block the nominees. [L4N2CP1E5]
When that didn't work and HMC declined to meet with Toshiba, METI gave the company Mizuno's name as ""someone with connections to HMC,"" according to the shareholder-commissioned investigation, conducted by three lawyers.
Yet Mizuno would be an unlikely messenger to tell a shareholder to back off, having spent years stressing governance issues. 
He once cautioned on Twitter against Japan's foreign investment rules, worried they gave overseas investors ""impressions of a setback in corporate governance or anti-shareholder activism.""
He told Reuters nobody asked him to deliver messages to HMC, and that he told METI Harvard was not an activist but rather ""a very sophisticated long-term investor. I volunteered to talk to Harvard to prove my point. METI didn't stop me.""
Mizuno said HMC leaders welcomed his input. HMC officials declined to comment.
Masayoshi Arai, Director-General of METI's Commerce and Information Policy Bureau, said that although a METI official gave Mizuno's name to Toshiba, ""He simply told Toshiba that Mizuno was being asked by HMC to give advice; he never said Toshiba should ask Mizuno or METI would ask Mizuno"".
The report found that after talks with Mizuno, HMC did not vote, an outcome helpful to Toshiba.
Some analysts say it remains unclear how METI will apply the new law to foreign investors, and the head of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has called for more detail from Toshiba.
Arai said Japan is open to foreign investment although national security concerns must take a top priority.
METI may have been happy to leave it to Mizuno to talk to Harvard, said Ulrike Schaede, a University of California professor following Japanese business, but it still remains unclear how open officials want Japan’s economy to become.

“The Toshiba case is bringing to the fore the burning issue on where on this spectrum Japan wants to fall,” Schaede said.
Mizuno declined to comment on his views about the new trade rules. But, he said, he is known as someone who takes “instruction from nobody.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Friday, potentially ending the first big week of the new quarterly corporate earnings season on a positive note.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 45 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 30 points, or 0.2%.
The first week of the second quarter’s corporate results season has centered around the U.S. banking sector. Most of the major lenders beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines as the release of reserves, as well as strength in equities trading and investment banking fees, masked weaker underlying profitability in lending. Sluggish loan activity coupled with stretched valuations have tended to see these banks struggle to post stock price gains.
Financial services company  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) is scheduled to report its results later Friday, and is expected to reap the benefit of its acquisition of online rival TD Ameritrade last year.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will also be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the chip maker is in talks to buy semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries for about $30 billion. 
Also of interest will be the release of retail sales data, which will serve as a gauge for the health of the consumer. Earlier this week Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that there had not been sufficient economic recovery to warrant the central bank reining in its ultra-easy monetary policy.
The June numbers are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and are seen illustrating Powell’s point, by dropping 0.4% on a month-on-month basis, a small improvement from May’s 1.3% fall.
 The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Sentiment is also due for release, at 10 AM ET, and is seen improving to 86.5 in July from 85.5 in June. 
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Friday, but are heading towards their worst week since mid-March on worries that the surge in new Covid-19 cases globally will hit demand, while the likelihood of a new OPEC+ production deal may lift supply at the same time.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $71.75 a barrel, on course to fall almost 4% this week, while the Brent contract was largely flat at $73.78, set to drop almost 3% this week.
Also of note will be the release later Friday of the Baker Hughes total of working U.S. oil rigs as well as the CFTC crude oil net speculative positions. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,818.70/oz, heading for its fourth consecutive weekly gain, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1801.

Regulators seized control of the institutions last July, after their owner Tomorrow Holdings Co Ltd was targeted in a government crackdown on risks posed by financial conglomerates.
The takeover period of the nine mid-sized firms will be extended for another year till July 16, 2022, according to statements from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. (CSRC)
The six firms taken over by the CBIRC are Tianan Property Insurance Co of China, Huaxia Life Insurance Co, Tianan Life Insurance Co and Yi'an P&C Insurance Co., as well as New Times Trust Co and New China Trust Co.
The other three firms are New Times Securities, Guosheng Securities and Guosheng Futures.
""The takeover team has actively pushed forward the asset liquidation and confirmation of those firms, figured out the basic situation of the risk they contained, and maintained normal operation of their daily businesses,"" CBIRC said in a statement.
The extension of the takeover period is to resolve the financial risks as soon as possible and to maintain financial stability, the CBIRC said.
Tomorrow's Chairman Xiao Jianhua was investigated more than four years ago amid the state-led conglomerate crackdown, and has not been seen since 2017.
In a previous takeover case involving Tomorrow, the central bank said the systemic risk posed by the group involved excessive borrowing and misuse of funds from the financial firms it owned.

Regulators took over Baoshang Bank in 2019, a lender once controlled by Tomorrow, citing severe credit risks.
The lender, which had operated nationwide, has been revamped into a much smaller lender back in its home region Inner Mongolia.

Investing.com – Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) stock plunged 6.3% to $11.58 in Friday’s premarket trading as officials from as many as seven government departments in China visited the ride-hailing company’s offices to carry out a cybersecurity review.
It has been a rough ride for China’s largest ride-hailing firm ever since it listed on the NYSE on June 30. Its shares have mostly traded below the issue price of $14.
The company has already warned of a hit to the revenue in view of the investigations in China that started at least two weeks ago.
Early July, the company was told to stop onboarding new users until a review was over. Playstores like Alipay and WeChat were asked to take Didi's app and dozens more other apps designed by the company off their platforms.
A July 5 report in The Wall Street Journal had said that the Chinese regulators wanted the company to delay its listing on the New York Stock Exchange but the company ignored it in absence of a formal order.
Didi is among the several companies the Chinese are probing given that many of them are now listed in the U.S. The authorities there are concerned over the stash of data they hold and which they may be required to share with the U.S. regulators to comply with the listing norms.
Didi operates in more than 4,000 locations in 15 countries, though China mobility represents the bulk of the revenue.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Paris Club calls for Ethiopia creditor committee to be formed,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Paris Club of sovereign creditors called on Friday for a creditor committee to be formed quickly to restructure Ethiopia's debt, increasing pressure on China to engage under a new joint G20 framework to grant debt relief to poor countries.
Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia are the only countries so far to have sought debt relief under the G20 framework which lays out how to agree debt restructurings under the same terms for all creditors, whether public or private.
Before debt negotiations can take place, a country seeking debt relief first has to agree an economic programme with the International Monetary Fund aiming at restoring sound public finances.
A committee involving the debtor country's main public creditors must then be formed and they have to come up with a debt relief outline consistent with guidance from the International Monetary Fund.
Paris Club chairman Emmanuel Moulin told journalists that forming a creditor committee for Ethiopia was proving complex because one creditor needed formal internal approval to proceed.
Moulin did not name China, but it is Ethiopia's biggest creditor and a source familiar with the situation said Beijing was still on the sidelines.
""We have expressed urgent concerns, which are shared with the International Monetary Fund. We are doing everything possible to form a creditor committee as soon as possible to handle Ethiopia's request,"" Moulin said.
He added that Ethiopia's current IMF programme was expiring in September, which made it all the more important to get a debt relief outline in the coming weeks.
While the process is dragging on for Ethiopia, Chad's case is more advanced, with a creditor committee formed and the IMF-backed debt relief guidance in place.
Moulin said that the Paris Club was prepared to reschedule Chad's debt over a long period, but expected a big private creditor that is currently holding out to do the same.
He did not name the private creditor, but around 40% of Chad's $2.8 billion external debt at the end of 2019 was owed to commercial creditors, comprised mainly of an oil-backed loan from Swiss commodities trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
Zambia, which has been in default since November last year after the coronavirus pandemic added to its long-running debt problem, has made little progress under the G20 framework ahead of elections in August.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>",CDC defends U.S. transit mask mandate as some call for scrapping,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. health official who signed a sweeping order for masks to be worn on nearly all forms of public transport said they were a key tool in preventing COVID-19 transmission even as some lawmakers call for ending the rules.
Marty Cetron, director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told Reuters Thursday the agency's ""current position"" is the mandate should not be lifted.
""Masks are really powerful and we should make sure they're part of our arsenal,"" Cetron said in an interview. ""We mask not just to protect ourselves - we mask because it's the way we take care and express our concern for each other.""
The rules in place since January require masks to be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis, and ride-shares and at transport hubs like airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations and ports.
""The truth is that the unvaccinated portion that's out there is extremely vulnerable,"" Cetron said, especially in an indoor transportation hub ""where the ventilation may not be optimized.""
A group of Republican lawmakers this week introduced legislation to prohibit mask mandates for public transport, arguing they no longer make sense with a growing number of Americans getting vaccinated. Republican Representative Andy Biggs said transit mask rules ""are only being kept in place by those who relish controlling our day-to-day lives.""
In mid-May, CDC said fully vaccinated people could avoid wearing masks indoors in most places - with some exceptions like transit.
The mask mandate has been a huge source of friction on U.S. airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that since Jan. 1 it has received 3,420 unruly passenger reports, including 2,559 for refusing to wear masks.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said Sunday was the single-busiest day since February 2020, with nearly 2.2 million passengers. 
""I get we're all just over this emotionally but I do think we will succeed together if we realize the virus is the enemy and it's not your fellow citizen or the person sitting next to you on a plane or a piece of cloth that you have to wear over your face,"" Cetron said.
The CDC transit mask order has no expiration date. In April, the TSA extended its mask requirement until Sept. 13.
""As long as the CDC order is in place, the expectation is the implementing modes ... would continue with their own directives,"" Cetron said.
""We won't wait until September to reevaluate,"" Cetron said, adding CDC is regularly reviewing the mandate. ""If the pandemic were to suddenly disappear before then we have the ability to take down the order.""

Under Donald Trump, a CDC push to mandate masks in transit was blocked.
Asked if he still believes there is a scientific or public health basis for U.S. travel restrictions that bar entry from some countries in the United States, Cetron said: ""I'm not going to get into the details"" but said U.S. government discussions are going on.

Investing.com –  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was up more than 8% in Friday’s premarket trading on news of its inclusion in S&P 500 Index from next week.
Being part of the S&P 500 means passive investors who manage trillions of dollars will have to include it in their portfolios, as it will now be part of more funds and derivatives benchmarked against the index.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was the last noteworthy addition to the index, joining it in late 2020.  
The inclusion in the index is another triumph for the biotech company whose pioneering work on so-called messenger RNA has allowed it to bring to market one of the most effective vaccines against COVID-19 vaccine. The company says the mRNA technology may have many other applications including vaccines against other diseases, as well as drugs for heart disease, cancer and rare genetic conditions.
Moderna will replace Alexion Pharmaceuticals in the index before the opening of trade on July 21. Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) is set to be acquired by U.K.'s AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Shares of Moderna have more than trebled over the past 12 months, sending the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company’s market value above $100 billion for the first time this week, according to Bloomberg.

LONDON (Reuters) -Burberry, the British brand seeking to replace departing boss Marco Gobbetti, said its like-for-like sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven by new, younger customers and demand for handbags and trench coats.
The 165-year-old group said on Friday retail revenue for the 13 weeks to June 26 rose 86% to 479 million pounds ($662 million), with comparable store sales rising 90% on the same period last year and 1% ahead of the period two years ago.
Gobbetti, who has sought to elevate Burberry in the luxury sector, is returning home to Italy to lead Ferragamo, the two companies said last month. The news sent Burberry's shares tumbling 10%.
Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Gobbetti's announcement had come as a surprise, but it was ""very much a personal decision"".
Riccardo Tisci, the designer who Gobbetti brought in to revitalise the brand, remained committed, she told reporters. Investors had feared he could follow the CEO out of the door.
""(Tisci) remains very excited by the opportunity to continue to inspire our customers with his imprint on Burberry's identity, reinforced by the response to his latest collection,"" she said. ""We're very, very confident of Riccardo's position.""
Brown said Gobbetti would remain until the end of 2021. She declined to say if she would apply to be his replacement.
Shares in Burberry reversed initial gains to trade down 4% in early deals on Friday.
Citi said the update would normally be sufficient to reinforce investor sentiment on the turnaround, but uncertainty around senior management was likely to persist.
CHINA STRENGTH
Burberry adds to evidence that luxury has rebounded from the pandemic. Cartier maker Richemont said on Friday its sales had more than doubled in the latest quarter.
Gobbetti said full-price sales accelerated as Burberry's collections attracted new, younger luxury customers. 
Burberry said it had strong growth in mainland China and Korea, helping comparable store sales in Asia Pacific rise 27%.
In March, the brand faced calls for a consumer boycott in China related to Xinjiang cotton. 
Brown said the issue had ""relatively limited impact"", although she declined to confirm if Burberry was still a member of the Better Cotton Initiative, a group that promotes sustainable cotton production.
The Americas were a stand out in other markets, with comparable sales up 341% on a year ago and 34% up on two years ago, driven by a new and younger clientele.

Stores in Europe, however, continued to be hit by lockdowns and weaker tourist footfall, it said.

Investing.com – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was up almost 1% in Friday’s premarket trading on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the company is in talks to buy GlobalFoundries for about $30 billion.
Mubadala, an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, owns GlobalFoundries. The deal is far from certain, according to the report.
Intel’s interest represents one of the biggest strategic moves yet under CEO Pat Gelsinger, who rejoined the company earlier this year. It comes at what may turn out to be peak of boom for chipmakers, who have been swamped with demand since the start of the pandemic and unable to increase supply quickly.
As companies adopt work from home, demand for digital devices from mobile to laptops to printers has surged, so has demand for smart electric vehicles and other renewables. All these machines have chips in them made by companies like Intel and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Supply has lagged, making such deals attractive.
In Intel's case, it has also ceded ground to players like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) in the last few years and is now trying to recover that. 
Intel has already announced plans to invest $20 billion in setting up two new manufacturing units in Arizona. GlobalFoundries too plans a new unit in Singapore, according to the WSJ.

Automakers around the world have had to adjust assembly lines due to the shortages, caused by manufacturing delays that some semiconductor makers blame on a faster-than expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
""We hope the chip supply crisis will bottom out this summer and expect to see an improvement in this situation within the second half of the year,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s China chief, Stephan Woellenstein, told reporters.
Starting in August, Volkswagen will source some chips from a new supplier, Woellenstein said, adding that the move would start to ease the shortage in September.
Because of the chip shortage, Volkswagen, which has partnerships with FAW Group and SAIC Motor, saw its sales drop 12.3% between April and June compared with a year earlier. Volkswagen's rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said its China sales in the second quarter grew 5%.

Premium brands including Audi and Porsche are growing, Woellenstein said. Audi sales in the first half this year in China grew 39% compared with the same period last year while Porsche increased 23%.
Woellenstein also said sales of VW's electric ID.4 cars hit 2,900 units in June, up from around 1,500 cars in May. Reuters reported last month that the ID series - the backbone of its electric vehicle ambitions - is off to what even company sources call a worryingly slow start in China.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Honda Motor Co's new chief executive said on Friday the Japanese automaker was willing to form new alliances to make electrification profitable.
""If through an alliance Honda can accomplish early what it should aim to be, then we'd be willing to form an alliance,"" Toshihiro Mibe, who took the top job in April, told a press briefing, when asked how he envisions global alliances on electrification.
Mibe's comments reflect the pressure on the global auto industry to share technology and costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles. He has assumed the top role at Japan's second-largest automaker at a time of a growing shift in automobile technology to electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving. 
Honda and its alliance partner General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have said they would introduce two jointly developed large-sized EV models in North America, using GM's Ultium batteries, in 2024 and will launch a series of new models which feature a new EV platform dubbed 'e:Architecture'.
The two companies already collaborate on autonomous vehicles as well as on fuel-cell vehicle (FCV) technology, and are exploring more ways to expand their alliance.
Honda has said it aims to increase the ratio of EVs and FCVs to 100% of all sales by 2040.
The price of electric vehicles, like home appliances, drops rapidly once the products are out in the market, Mibe said.
""Building an alliance will become a huge direction in terms of increasing the number of electric vehicles, considering how electrification is not commercially feasible right now,"" he added.
Traditionally known for its fuel-efficient internal-combustion engines, Honda launched its first mass-produced all-battery vehicle in August.
Honda could differentiate itself in the electrification race with next generation batteries for EVs, Mibe said.
The Honda chief also said that the automaker expects to see profitability of its car business improve in the next fiscal year as a result of shutting down several unviable manufacturing facilities, including its factories in the United Kingdom, Turkey and Japan.

Last year, Honda saw operating income margin at 13% for motorcycles and 1% for cars.
The company will take electrification as an opportunity to review its product lineup and to improve profitability, Mibe said, adding that Honda is considering a new digital service or business by utilising customer data.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Cartier maker Richemont said on Friday a strong performance from its jewellery brands, particularly in the Americas, helped its sales more than double in the three months to June 30 as the pandemic's impact waned.
Sales of luxury goods have recovered this year from the pandemic-related downturn with Richemont benefiting more than others thanks to its leading position in jewellery, its biggest product category.
Earlier this week, Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) said it returned to profit in the first six months of 2021 as constant currency sales jumped more than 50%. Also on Friday, Britain's Burberry posted like-for-like quarterly sales above pre-pandemic levels.
Richemont's sales at constant currency rose by 129% to 4.397 billion euros ($5.19 billion) in the June quarter versus the year-ago quarter, the world's second-biggest luxury goods group said in a statement. They were also 22% higher than in the same quarter in 2019.
Jewellery brands and regions Americas, Asia Pacific and Middle East all saw constant currency sales increase by more than 40% versus the 2019 quarter. 
Watch brand sales were also up 6%, but Europe was still down 15% versus two years ago hit by the absence tourist shoppers, Richemont said.
""Jewelry will be one of the main growth drivers of the luxury goods sector in the next five years,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said, adding dominant brands would continue to gain market share. 
""Richemont is best positioned in jewellery, and seems to regain its shine in watches, outperforming the Swatch Group,"" he said. 
Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said the strong performance in Asia outside of Japan and in the United States was a positive read-across for LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP). 
Richemont, which recently acquired Belgian leather goods maker Delvaux, also said the chief executives of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and fashion and accessories would leave the senior executive committee to solely focus on their businesses.

635,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 02:18AM ET</span>",Europe Auto Sales Fall 2 Million Cars Short of 2019’s First Half,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers sold almost 2 million fewer cars in Europe during the first half compared with two years ago, as the industry’s recovery in the region falls short of the rebound seen in the U.S. and China.
Registrations rose 13% in June compared with a year ago, bringing the total in the first six months to 6.49 million cars, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. While that’s a 27% increase from the first half of last year, it’s well below levels the industry was accustomed to prior to the pandemic.
Europe’s slower pace of vaccinations and longer-lasting measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 kept a lid on sales early in the year, while the global shortage of semiconductors also constrained automakers’ ability to maintain inventory. The dearth of chips will continue to pinch production for years to come, according to the chief executives of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), BMW AG (DE:BMWG_p) and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY).
“With the further easing of lockdown measures and subsequent support from an improving economic backdrop, selling rates should pick up over the second half of this year,” analysts at LMC Automotive said in a report. “Risks lie on the downside, as the semiconductor supply shortage threatens to disrupt the post‐lockdown rebound in demand.”
The slower sales recovery in Europe is having little effect on the bottom lines of VW and Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), the region’s two largest auto manufacturers. The former is benefiting from strong deliveries in China, while the latter is cashing in on buyers snapping up lucrative Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups in the U.S.
VW last week reported that earnings surged to 11 billion euros ($13 billion) in the first half, while Stellantis said its profit margin for the period should exceed its 5.5% to 7.5% forecast for the year.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is getting a boost from a “breathtaking” rise in pricing, CEO Jim Farley said last month, after issuing a much better financial outlook. Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) similarly said Thursday that its sales skewed to more lucrative models last quarter.
Stellantis posted the biggest sales gain among major automakers in Europe during the first half with a 32% increase, ahead of VW group’s 29% advance. Renault’s registrations slumped 19% last month, limiting the French carmaker to a 7% gain through June.
In the luxury segment, BMW got the better of rival Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) both last month and in the first half. The Bavarian brand was up 21% in June and 31% year-to-date, while Mercedes registrations slumped 13% last month and increased 18% so far this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Friday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp losses ahead of the release of Eurozone inflation data for June.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
European markets struggled on Thursday, with the main indices all dropping around 1%, weighed down by concerns that rising Covid cases will stunt global growth just as central banks start to fret about soaring inflation. 
Earlier Friday, the Bank of Japan downgraded its real GDP forecast for 2021 while keeping its monetary policy unchanged, now expecting growth of 3.8% compared with the 4.0% forecast it made in April. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has also cut its 2021 growth forecasts Friday for most of the countries in Southeast Asia, where Covid-19 infections are surging.
This hit to growth may have a read across to European markets with Covid cases also starting to rise again here despite the population being more vaccinated on average.
With this in mind, investors will keep a close eye on the release of the latest consumer price inflation data from the Eurozone, ahead of next week’s policy-setting meeting by the European Central Bank.
The June CPI release, due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), is expected to see the annual figure fall back to +1.9%, dropping below the bank’s 2% target. 
In corporate news, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Swedish telecommunications company announced a $8.3 billion multi-year 5G deal from U.S. giant  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ). Sportswear maker Puma  (DE:PUMG) may also get some attention after raising its guidance for the year.
The auto sector is also likely to be in focus after data showed European car registrations surged in June, rising for the fourth month in row. The growth rate was chiefly a function of the collapse in sales last year when coronavirus restrictions shut car dealerships across Europe.
Elsewhere, oil prices marginally lower Friday, heading towards their worst week since mid-March on worries that the surge in new Covid-19 cases globally will hit demand, while the likelihood of a new OPEC+ production deal may lift supply at the same time.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $71.43 a barrel, on course to fall almost 4% this week, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $73.21, set to drop almost 3% this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,825.20/oz, heading for its fourth consecutive weekly gain, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1804.

Samsung (KS:005930) is considering a location in Williamson County in Texas for the chip contract manufacturing facility that would consist of an investment ""in excess of $17 billion dollars"" and result in 1,800 new jobs, the document made public on Thursday showed. 
Williamson County is home to the Taylor Independent School District, which is considering the tax breaks Samsung has applied for, the documents showed. The school district is considering capping the taxable value of Samsung's proposed facility at $80 million for 10 years instead of the market value of $4.35 billion estimated as of 2029, according to the document.
Earlier this year, Samsung had sought incentives from Travis County, Austin, where it has its existing chip plant, to possibly build the $17 billion facility there. 
However, there has been no new public documentation filed for the Travis County site since March, the website for the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts showed on Friday.
Samsung reiterated in the document that it is also looking at alternative sites in the United States including Arizona and New York, as well as in South Korea. 

Should an investment be made, Samsung plans to break ground by the first quarter of next year with production due to start by end-2024, it showed. 
Countries such as the United States have redoubled efforts to secure chip production as a continued global shortage of semiconductor chips hobbles various industries including automobiles.

Shang Yanchun, a director who led one of the two teams for technology, media and telecommunications at CIC Capital, recently left to seek other opportunities, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lu Man, who was in charge of manufacturing deals at the direct investment arm, left earlier this year, they said, asking not to be identified as the departures were private.
More than 20 team leaders and managing directors have left in recent years, deepening an exodus even after the fund set up a leadership group for high-level recruitment. The departures highlight CIC’s challenges in bolstering its appeal as an employer, which has been eroded by shrinking opportunities, sliding compensation competitiveness and rising restrictions.
“Personnel change is a normal phenomenon for enterprises,” Beijing-based CIC said in an emailed statement, reiterating its commitment to “garner high-caliber, dedicated professionals.” Shang and Lu couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
The duo add to at least five departures last year at the direct investment arm alone, where deal-making has become more difficult as protectionism in major markets like the U.S. rises and the pandemic curbs travel. Executive Vice President Zhang Qing left in early 2019, and Winston Ma, a managing director and former head of the Toronto office, quit in 2018.
As a result of the company’s bid last year to replenish its talent pool, Yu Bin, who left in 2014 for Neuberger Berman, rejoined CIC’s public equities department as a managing director, people familiar with the matter said earlier.
More recently, CIC hired Wang Cuishan, an 18-year property investment veteran from Pacific Eagle Holdings Corp. as a director in the real estate department, the people said.
Little progress has been disclosed on plans announced in 2017 to increase the unit’s capital to as much as $100 billion, including a potential overseas bond sale. The fund has received little fresh capital to deploy after 2012 as the nation’s foreign exchange reserves reversed their years-long surge in 2014.
The share of alternative assets -- which include the direct investments for which CIC Capital was created in 2015 -- in its overseas portfolio fell almost 2 percentage points in 2019, according to that year’s annual report. The measure climbed again last year, and the company committed a record amount of capital in private deals, heralding further increases, Executive Vice President Zhao Haiying said in an interview in March.
In 2019, CIC Capital committed a combined $5.8 billion of new investments in 30 deals, spanning infrastructure, energy, TMT and manufacturing.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, as ongoing concerns about the economic recovery from COVID-19 ended the week on a sour note.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.13% by 10:21 PM ET (2:21 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan handing down its policy decision later in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.53% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.22%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.83%. The U.S. is due to issue an advisory cautioning its companies about the risks of doing business in the city, a move that could escalate tensions between the U.S. and China.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.19% and the SZSE Component was down 0.29%.
U.S. counterparts also fell, with declines in growth favorite stocks in the energy and technology sector such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). dragging Wall Street lower. However, vaccine producer  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) saw its shares rally in extended trading after the company said that it was set to join the S&P 500.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is set for a third weekly retreat and on the data front, the 360,000 initial jobless claims were filed for the week.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell wrapped up his second day of testimony before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Thursday. There, he continued to hold his view that uncomfortably high inflation would be temporary, although he has said the U.S. economic recovery is far from over, with the Fed closing watching inflation before it begins asset tapering.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated Powell’s views, saying she expects “several more months of rapid inflation,” adding that expectations for price gains still look well contained.
However, others raised concerns that higher inflation will hurt the economic outlook, with some of Powell’s colleagues even arguing that the time has come to scale back emergency policy settings. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard urged a move forward in reducing stimulus, arguing the goal of achieving “substantial further progress” on both inflation and employment has been met.
Global stocks continued to remain near record levels, but the Fed’s eventual asset tapering, ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks involving the Delta variant, indications of a peaking economic recovery and slowing corporate earnings momentum all remain as risks.
However, some investors remained optimistic that the growth cycle is not over yet.
“It’s possible that we’ve reached peak growth, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the cycle is rolling over,” J O Hambro Capital Management senior fund manager Giorgio Caputo told Bloomberg.
“When you factor in those peak growth concerns, as well as what’s been going on with the Delta variant of COVID-19 and the way interest rates have been declining, it does seem like we’re having a little bit of a growth scare,” he added."
641,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 10:15PM ET</span>",China to order developers to disclose commercial paper debt every month - sources,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese regulators want property developers to disclose details of rapidly growing commercial paper issuance in their monthly reports, said three sources, as part of Beijing's move to rein in ballooning debt in the property sector as the economy slows.
Real estate developers in the world's second largest economy are major issuers in the commercial paper market, which saw new issues worth 3.6 trillion yuan ($556.00 billion) in 2020, up 20% from 2019.
Commercial paper, which is not counted as interest-bearing debt, is commonly used in the property sector as a payable that promises construction suppliers a payment on a future fixed date, usually within one year, though the suppliers sometimes sell the paper before maturity at a small discount in the secondary market.
Property developers, however, have increasingly used commercial paper to raise funds. 
The regulators push for greater oversight comes amid rising late payments for these papers by firms including like China Evergrande Group, the most indebted developer with $88 billion in borrowings, China Fortune Land and Sichuan Languang Development.
It also comes as Beijing looks to tackle unbridled borrowing by developers outside the usual financing channels like bank loans and bond issuance to curb financial risk.
Regulators want more transparency, what developers are using the paper for and whether they are fully disclosing how much of these bills they hold, said a developer, who is aware of the discussion on impending requirement to disclose monthly all commercial paper that had still to mature.
Because he was not authorised to speak to media, the developer declined to be named, as did another developer and financial services source who were also aware of the new requirement.
People's Bank of China did not respond to request for comment. 
China's property market has rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 shock, raising concerns about financial risks and overheating. Late last year, authorities began stepping up curbs on the sector, including restricting debt accumulation.
Twelve major developers, including Evergrande, have to disclose their debt position from channels including banks, debt markets and off-balance sheet projects every month to the regulators in a pilot scheme put in place by PBOC and housing authorities late last year, but that had not covered commercial paper.
LEGAL LOOPHOLE
Some developers, brokers said, issue the paper to associates and even shell firms, or issue multiple papers to a supplier against the same invoice, who then sell them directly in the secondary market and hand the cash back to the issuer.
Many local financial institutions are also holders of these commercial papers, and some of them package the instrument into trust and wealth management products to sell to retail investors, industry officials said.
""It's a legal loophole,"" said Xinpeng Zhu, a lawyer at Shanghai Rongying Law Firm who is representing commercial paper holders including fund and wealth management companies, banks, brokerages and retail investors in late payment cases.
Some plaintiffs had packaged commercial paper in wealth management products to sell to retail investors, he said.
Evergrande is the biggest issuer of commercial papers. Its flagship unit, Evergrande Real Estate Group, had 205.7 billion yuan ($32 billion) worth of commercial paper at the end of 2020, 24% higher than 2019 and 390% higher than 2015, filings showed.
The actual figure of outstanding paper for Hong Kong-listed parent could be much higher, analysts said, as not all the instruments are consolidated into the holding company's financials, and its other units also issue commercial paper.
Evergrande told Reuters only an ""extremely small"" amount of its paper was not repaid on time. It said it did not issue any commercial paper to associates for financing purposes and that it was unaware of its papers being packaged into wealth management products.
Despite Evergrande saying last month that it was arranging payments for some of its project companies' commercial paper that had not been repaid on time, the news triggered a selloff in its equities and bonds.
Evergrande's onshore and offshore bonds maturing in the next two years were trading at a yield of 35% and 23% respectively.

According to commercial paper marketplace Weipiaobao website, the commercial paper of Evergrande Yuanlin, a unit that designs and builds gardens for the parent firm's projects, was selling on Tuesday at 36% below its issue value. The commercial paper for other developers was on averaged selling at 20% below the issue value.

Rio said it now expects to ship near the lower end of its range of 325 million tonnes (mt) and 340 mt in calendar 2021, meaning it may hand back its crown as the world's biggest producer to Brazilian rival Vale S.A..
Vale, which reports output later this month, is on track to meet the upper end of its 2021 guidance of 315-335 mt, according to UBS. 
Rio shipped 76.3 million tonnes (mt) of the steel-making commodity for the three months ended June 30, down from 86.7 mt a year ago, just ahead of a UBS estimate of 76 mt.
""We would have liked to have seen higher production to capitalise on these iron ore prices. Still, they are going to be swimming in cash at results time,"" said analyst David Lennox at Fat Prophets in Sydney.
""Hopefully we will get a good dividend and we are looking for a share buyback as well.""
Iron ore prices surged to records above $230 a tonne in May thanks to a post-COVID infrastructure drive by China. 
Rio is expected to post half-year underlying earnings of $10.9 billion on July 28 according to a Vuma consensus of 14 analysts, more than double the $4.75 billion it reported for the same period last year.
Rio on Friday also raised its full-year iron ore production cost guidance due to increased labour and input costs.
The miner expects unit costs of $18.00-$18.50 per tonne for the year, up from its previous estimate of $16.70-$17.70 per tonne, even as prices it received for iron ore doubled to $168.40 a dry metric tonne free on board for the first half. 
Miners have been facing labour shortages as Australia has shut international borders and snap closed state borders.

Rio also said it delayed commissioning at its new Gudai-Darri iron ore hub to later this year and first production from its Winu copper find in Australia to 2025 from original estimates of 2023, partly due to COVID restrictions.
It lowered 2021 production by 2 Mt due to new strategies to protect Aboriginal areas of high cultural significance as it seeks to repair relations with Aboriginal groups following its destruction of rock shelters at Juukan Gorge last year.

SD Biosensor Inc. surged as much as 28% to 66,700 won in early trading in Seoul on Friday, before paring its gain to 20% as of 9:45 a.m. The company raised 776.4 billion won at a 5.4 trillion won ($4.7 billion) valuation in an offering that was more than 1,000 times oversubscribed.
The double-digit gain still leaves the stock far short of its daily limit of 135,200 won. The debut comes amid what’s shaping up to be a record year for Korean IPOs and at a time when healthcare stocks in the nation are bouncing back from their 2021 lows amid a resurgence in infections. SD Biosensor’s blockbuster sales for January-March equaled about 80% of its revenue for all of 2020.
“Our goal is to join the world’s top three in point-of-care testing in three years,” Lee Hyo-Keun, the firm’s vice chairman and co-chief executive, said in an interview. “We want to be like Samsung (KS:005930) is in smartphones.”
As the global rollout of coronavirus vaccines clouds the outlook for makers of diagnostic products, SD Biosensor seeks to keep its momentum going post-pandemic through M&A. The firm, which sells a pair of its testing kits for $14 locally, plans to spend up to 2 trillion won on acquisitions, Lee said, with more details to emerge early next year. It is looking to add distribution channels in the U.S., South America and Europe.
U.S. giant  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) last month forecast disappointing profits on a rapid decline in testing demand. SD Biosensor’s quarterly sales may come down from the $1 billion level as prices of test kits decline due to competition, Lee said, adding however that demand has remained surprisingly strong amid the spread of coronavirus variants.
“We thought sales of diagnostic products would decline once vaccination starts, but testing demand from vaccinated people is growing,” he said. “They want to discover whether the vaccination works against the variants.”
Making a Billionaire
SD Biosensor, which has partnered with Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) on global distribution, was dealt an unexpected blow before the IPO, as a Korean financial regulator asked it to lower the offering price on concerns of overvaluation. The firm initially planned to raise as much as 1 trillion won at a valuation of nearly 9 trillion won.
“There were worries about high IPO prices due to concerns that vaccinations would lower testing demand and sales would drop sharply,” Lee said. “We had to admit that there were concerns in the market, and lower the price.”
READ: Krafton Cuts Offer  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Ending Bid for Record Korea IPO
But even at the reduced figure, SD Biosensor’s IPO is set to make Cho Young-Shik, its founder and chairman, a billionaire. Cho, who started the company’s predecessor Standard Diagnostics in 1999, owns a 32% stake in SD Biosensor, valued at $1.5 billion at the IPO price.
The surge in his fortune comes at a time when the massive wealth created at some pandemic beneficiaries is dwindling as vaccines raise hopes for an end to the coronavirus. The founder of Seegene Inc., another Korean testing firm, joined the ranks of billionaires last year only to slip off this year as the stock fell.
SD Biosensor saw a 418-fold jump in net income to 585.7 billion won in 2020, driven by sales of Covid tests in India and Europe. It plans to enter the U.S. market through the partnership with Roche during the second half of this year, once the Food and Drug Administration approves its kit.
The IPO proceeds will be used to mass produce and promote its diagnostic machines for various diseases beyond Covid-19.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday reached a preliminary agreement with a California regulator for sharing data on sexual assault and harassment claims on its platform while protecting victims' privacy and avoiding a $59 million fine.
Under the proposal outlined in a regulatory filing with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the penalty would be reduced to $150,000, but Uber would pay $9 million to support a state victims' fund and help create industry-wide safety and reporting standards.
""We've been able to find a path forward that preserves the privacy and agency of sexual assault survivors,"" Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said in a statement.
The CPUC fined Uber in December after the company refused to share victims' detailed information, including full names and contact information, arguing that doing so would violate their right to privacy.
The dispute stems from a safety report Uber released in December 2019, disclosing 6,000 reports of sexual assault related to 2.3 billion trips in the United States in 2017 and 2018. 
That report, aimed at ensuring drivers and the public that Uber was serious about safety, has put the company in the spotlight. Rival ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) has promised a similar report, but said it would await the conclusion of the CPUC procedures before releasing its data.
The agreement proposed by Uber, a division of the CPUC and an anti-sexual abuse group, would see Uber provide anonymized data on past instances of assault to the agency.

Going forward, Uber will also provide anonymized data, but offer individuals the ability to opt in to being contacted by the CPUC when they report a claim. All ride-hail companies operating in California, including Lyft, would have to comply with those future data requests.
The agreement is subject to approval by an administrative judge and the full commission.

The automaker posted record vehicle deliveries for the April-to-June quarter earlier this month, as it dealt with a semiconductor shortage and relied on sales of its cheaper models.
California registrations for the Model Y, Tesla's electric crossover utility vehicle, jumped more than sevenfold to 13,581, Cross-Sell data showed on Thursday.
The focus is now on the company's second-quarter earnings report due on July 26, with investors waiting to gauge if bitcoin's recent fall would hit Tesla's bottom line, due to its exposure to the cryptocurrency's volatility.
Total second-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected stood at 46,926, with Model Y accounting for more than half of the registrations.
California, a bellwether for the electric-car maker, accounted for about half of the vehicle registrations in these states with a total of 23,556 registrations, Cross-Sell data showed.

Tesla has been increasing prices for its vehicles in recent months, with billionaire boss Elon Musk in May blaming the rise on ""major supply chain price pressure"", especially raw materials.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stevanato Group S.p.A., an Italian maker of glass vials for COVID-19 vaccines and other healthcare products, raised $672 million in a downsized initial public offering on Thursday.
Stevanato said in a statement it priced 32 million shares at $21 per share, compared to its previous plan of 40 million shares at indicated price range of $21 to $24.
The IPO values Stevanato at $6.3 billion. 
Founded by billionaire Sergio Stevanato, the Padua-based company started in 1949 as Soffieria Stella, a specialty glass manufacturer that was the precursor to the medical packaging company.
Stevanato provides glass vials and syringes to approximately 90% of currently marketed vaccine programs, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The company started its international expansion in 2015 after the purchase of a primary packaging company in Slovakia.

Stevanato will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""STVN"" on Friday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) are the lead underwriters for the offering.

Any deal talks don't appear to include GlobalFoundries directly, as a spokesperson for the company told the Journal it was not in discussions with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/3yXFQLU)
Talks come as a semiconductor shortage is hobbling industries around the globe. A deal could help Intel ramp up production of chips at a time demand is at its peak and the company is looking to start producing chips for car makers that have struggled to keep operations running due to severe shortages.
Intel, one of the last companies in the semiconductor industry that both designs and manufactures its own chips, said earlier this year it would expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity by spending as much as $20 billion to invest in factories in the U.S.
Intel said it intended to open its factories to outside chip designers, as it competes with Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, has a manufacturing footprint across the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Mubadala is looking at a potential listing of GlobalFoundries later in the year, Reuters reported in June, citing sources familiar with the matter. (https://reut.rs/2UQD0cK)

GlobalFoundries' customers includes Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, its parent company before it was spun off more than a decade earlier, a relationship that could spark antitrust questions about an Intel deal.
Intel declined to comment, while Mubadala and GlobalFoundries did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

(Reuters) -American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday it has asked about 3,300 flight attendants on voluntary leave to return by the holiday travel season to meet rising customer demand, according to a letter to staff reviewed by Reuters.
The U.S. airline said it would also begin recruiting and hiring about 800 new flight attendants by March 2022.
""Increasing customer demand and new routes starting later this year mean we need more flight attendants to operate the airline,"" the company said.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) furloughed around 8,000 flight attendants when federal aid for airline workers temporarily expired last year and thousands of others have taken voluntary leave programs meant to save costs during the pandemic.
But as travel demand has surged thanks to speedy COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions, airlines have scrambled to bring back employees whose jobs may have otherwise been at risk when a third round of government aid expires in October.
U.S. airlines have received a total $54 billion to cover workers' salaries during the coronavirus crisis. Coupled with the rebound, that money helped Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) on Wednesday post its first quarterly profit since the pandemic. 
American, which is due to report second-quarter results next Thursday, has said it could also report a small profit.

Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker has said demand remains strong in July and for the remainder of the summer, with business customers increasingly returning.
Other airlines have also announced plans to recall staff and begin hiring again, a drastic turnaround from furlough threats when the industry remained in the doldrums a year ago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday issued a directive to operators of all Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 series airplanes to conduct inspections to address possible failures of cabin altitude pressure switches.
The directive requires operators to conduct repetitive tests of the switches and replace them if needed. The directive covers 2,502 U.S.-registered airplanes and 9,315 airplanes worldwide.
It was prompted after an operator reported in September that both pressure switches failed the on-wing functional test on three different 737 models.
The FAA said failure of the switches could result in the cabin altitude warning system not activating if the cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 feet (3,050 m), at which point oxygen levels could become dangerously low.
Airplane cabins are pressurized to the equivalent of not more than 8,000 feet (2438 m).
Boeing said it supports ""the FAA’s direction, which makes mandatory the inspection interval that we issued to the fleet in June."" The FAA directive did not report any in-flight failures of the switches.
The FAA said on Thursday that tests must be conducted within 2,000 flight hours since the last test of the cabin altitude pressure switches, before airplanes have flown 2,000 hours, or within 90 days of the directive's effective date.
Boeing initially reviewed the issue, including the expected failure rate of the switches, and found it did not pose a safety issue.
Subsequent investigation and analysis led the FAA and Boeing to determine in May that ""the failure rate of both switches is much higher than initially estimated, and therefore does pose a safety issue."" Boeing declined to say what the failure rate was.
The FAA added it ""does not yet have sufficient information to determine what has caused this unexpectedly high failure rate.""

Due to the importance of functions provided by the switch, the FAA in 2012 mandated all Boeing 737 airplanes utilize two switches to provide redundancy in case of one switch’s failure.
The directive covers all versions of the 737 jetliners, including the MAX, but is unrelated to any issues related to the MAX's return to service last November.

MILAN (Reuters) -U.S. and international unions have accused Ray-Ban maker Luxottica, the Italian arm of eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, of violating workers' right to unionise at a U.S. plant in Georgia and asked the Italian, French and U.S. governments to mediate.
In a statement sent to Reuters, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), together with the AFL-CIO and two other workers' groups, alleged that managers of the Luxottica plant in McDonough, near Atlanta, Georgia, unleashed an ""aggressive and fear-inducing"" campaign to discourage its 2,000 employees from seeking union membership.
The unions filed a complaint on Thursday under guidelines for multinational firms set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which say multinational firms should not interfere with workers' organising rights.
The filing is an example of non-unionized U.S. factory and warehouse workers seeking the intervention of international labour authorities in their attempt to gain union representation, instead of turning to the domestic National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Last year, a group of international labour unions complained about McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) to the OECD, saying the fast-food chain did not adequately address sexual harassment issues.
""The NLRB is really broken,"" Tim Dubnau, deputy director of organising at CWA, told Reuters. ""We know exactly what's gonna happen. We go the NLRB, the company stalls and then spends 80 days intimidating people, acting like thugs at work, forcing people to listen to union-busting nonsense.""
The NLRB said its regional staff throughout the country are committed to ensuring each case is thoroughly investigated. Reuters could not find any record that a case was filed by Luxottica with the NLRB.
The CWA said Luxottica - which was founded 60 years ago by Leonardo Del Vecchio and made him one of Italy's richest men - like other European companies, has good relationships with unions at home but operated differently in the United States, taking advantage of weaker labour laws there.
""I don't think it's going to fly when the Italians understand that this company that prides itself on having a good reputation of being pro-worker is treating people in America very, very differently,"" Dubnau said.
A U.S. spokesperson for Luxottica told Reuters the company maintains ""strong and productive relationships with unions globally, wherever our employees choose to be represented by them.
""In Atlanta, our employees overwhelmingly voted in favour of a direct relationship with us instead of union representation less than three years ago,"" the spokesperson added.
The plant in McDonough produces lenses for Luxottica's subsidiaries Lenscrafters, Pearle Vision, Oakley, and other company-owned brands. 
""The climate in the United States is changing. Support for unions is growing and President (Joe) Biden has been very clear that his administration believes that union membership is the best way for workers to improve their wages and working conditions,"" said CWA spokeswoman Beth Allen.
Just over 6 percent of U.S. private-sector workers belong to unions.
'A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT'
The unions say the Georgia plant managers used a company app called ""LiveSafe"" to warn employees about the alleged risks of union organising, including that they might lose pay and benefits if they succeed in forming a union. 
The unions said the app was originally meant to inform workers on COVID-19 issues. The Luxottica spokesperson said the app was introduced in 2018 and is a valuable platform for reaching employees without access to email. 
Organizers also accuse the Georgia plant managers of creating an anti-union website, hiring Labor Relations Institute, a U.S. consulting firm that specialises in helping companies fight union organising, and requiring employees to attend mandatory union-bashing meetings.
""We do not believe that having a union is in your best interest or ours,"" the website https://luxfacts.com says.
""With a U.S. union, the open culture at Luxottica would change. Your ability to be an individual contributor and succeed based on your own merit and hard work might be compromised.""
The OECD requires each member state to have so-called ""national points of contact"" - or government offices - to review complaints about alleged breaches of its guidelines for multinationals and offer to mediate. But it cannot impose sanctions or force firms to resolve disputes. 
The unions also accuse Luxottica's global management in Milan and Paris of failing to address the situation in Georgia.
The U.S. spokesperson for Luxottica said all employee communications by the company that have referred to unions ""are in compliance with U.S. labour laws and common practice for U.S. companies.""
Georgia is a so-called ""right-to-work state"", meaning private sector workers cannot be required to join a union or pay dues as a condition of employment.
“These European companies, many of which deal with unions in Europe, exist in a very different environment there,” former NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman said. ""Call it Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, because these companies sort of have two different operating philosophies.""

Sonia Paoloni, a senior official at Italy's biggest union CGIL, told Reuters the company had excellent relations with unions in Italy and offered extensive benefits to its 14,000 local workers, including, for example, reimbursing expenses for school books for the children of employees.
""I certainly struggle to recognise the behaviour of Luxottica in Georgia as coming from the same company I know in Italy. If Luxottica did the same things in Italy we would sue them for anti-union activity under our labour laws,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended lower on Thursday, pulled down by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other Big Tech companies as a fall in weekly jobless claims data fed investor concerns about a recent inflation spike.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 4.4% and Amazon fell over 1%, both companies contributing more than any others to the Nasdaq's decline. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lost 0.9%. 
The S&P 500 technology sector index fell 0.8% and ended a four-day winning streak. Earlier this week, investors' favor for heavyweight growth stocks pushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs.
The S&P 500 energy sector index fell 1.4% and tracked a drop in crude prices on expectations of more supply after a compromise agreement between leading OPEC producers.
Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to a 16-month low, while worker shortages and bottlenecks in the supply chain have frustrated efforts by businesses to ramp up production to meet strong demand for goods and services.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers he anticipated the shortages and high inflation would abate. Yet many investors still worry that more sustained inflation could lead to a sooner-than-expected tightening of monetary policy.
""People are very nervous and concerned about inflation, tax rates and the (2022 midterm) election. Those three things are very much on people's minds,"" said 6 Meridian Chief Investment Officer Andrew Mies, describing recent phone calls with his firm's clients.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% to 14,543.13.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) ended up 0.2% after it beat expectations for quarterly profit, getting a boost from record investment banking activity even as the trading bonanza that supported results in recent quarters slowed down.
Second-quarter reporting season kicked off this week, with the four largest U.S. lenders -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) - posting a combined $33 billion in profits, but also highlighting the industry's sensitivity to low interest rates.
Analysts on average expect 66% growth in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES estimate data from Refinitiv.
With the S&P 500 up about 16% so far this year, investors will be looking for companies to provide strong forecasts to justify sky-high valuations.
""Investors are definitely starting to look at 2022 estimates,"" Mies said. ""I think you could see six months from now the stock market basically where it is currently."" 
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) said late on Wednesday it would pay $2.2 billion for 9.9% stake in American International Group (NYSE:AIG)'s life and retirement business. AIG and Blackstone both rallied more than 3%.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) dipped 1.2% after it voluntarily recalled five aerosol sunscreen products in the United States after detecting a cancer-causing chemical in some samples.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 178 new lows.

According to excerpts obtained by CNN from the upcoming book ""I Alone Can Fix It,"" written by two Washington Post journalists, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and other senior U.S. military leaders discussed resigning in the event they received orders they considered illegal or dangerous.
""I never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our Government ... If I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley,"" Trump said in a statement. 
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, had privately acknowledged concerns that Trump might attempt to draw in the military to quash dissent, as fears about Trump's potential misuse of the Insurrection Act mounted. 
A planned, orderly resignation by the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not been previously reported.
Reuters could not independently confirm the account by the Post reporters and Milley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The publisher of the book declined to provide excerpts and did not confirm or deny the veracity of the CNN account. 
Trump selected Milley for the top military position in 2018, despite then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis favoring the chief of the Air Force for the position. 
Mattis resigned as defense secretary in 2018 over policy differences and since then Trump has branded him ""the world's most overrated general.""

""(Milley) got his job only because the world's most overrated general, James Mattis, could not stand him, had no respect for him, and would not recommend him,"" Trump said in the statement.
Milley and Trump's relationship deteriorated last year after the U.S. military officer publicly apologized for joining the president as he walked from the White House to a nearby church for a photo opportunity after authorities cleared the way of protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets.

In-part because of this trend, the current price levels of healthcare stocks NovoCure (NASDAQ:NVCR), 10x Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG), GoodRx (GDRX), and Doximity (DOCS) look unsustainable given their bleak growth potential. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Over the past year, the healthcare industry has made significant progress in providing analytics-based digital solutions and has played a major role in the battle against an historic public health crisis. The use of big data in healthcare services should drive the industry’s growth in the long run. A significant shift to value-based healthcare is occurring, with an emphasis on smart decision making, mitigating risk and preventative care.
However, given the current focus on production and manufacturing industries to help drive the economy back to pre-pandemic levels, capital investments in the field of healthcare are likely to remain low in the near term.
With that in mind, we think the current price levels of healthcare stocks NovoCure Limited (NVCR), 10x Genomics, Inc. (TXG), GoodRx Holdings, Inc. (GDRX), and Doximity, Inc. (DOCS) look unsustainable, given the companies’ weak growth prospects. Therefore, these stocks are best avoided now.

AMC shares were recently up 1.7% at $33.99 after four straight days of losses. The hugely volatile stock has lost more than half its value since hitting a record high of $76.62 on June 2. On Thursday, the stock swung between a low of $32.14 and a high of $37.40.
Shares of videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), meanwhile, continued their recent tumble and were off 3.1% at $162.34, compared with its June peak of $344.66. 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) said late Wednesday that it had hired of a former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive to lead its video games unit as it ramps up efforts beyond its traditional streaming business, potentially adding competition for GameStop.
Cinema operator AMC and GameStop have been at the center of massive rallies in meme stocks that hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors coordinating their buying on websites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. 
While both are sitting on big year-to-date-gains - AMC is up about 1500% in 2021 and GameStop is up around 760% - their more recent slides have led some analysts to question whether the retail fervor that buoyed their shares is dying down.
Retail investor purchases of meme stocks tracked by Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research have declined steeply since early June, roughly mirroring the fall in the basket of meme stocks followed by the firm.
“Retail investors are slowly capitulating on meme stocks, and prices are tumbling as a result,” Vanda’s analysts said in a recent note.
Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for “invest” and “buy stocks” have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, in what DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said is an ominous sign for the meme stock rally.
""Bubbles need fresh money, or they deflate. Quickly,"" wrote Colas in a Thursday research note.

JPMorgan’s Peng Cheng, however, noted that AMC and some other meme stocks saw “significant” retail buying last week, even as they declined.
Other stocks popular on social media include Marin Software which was down 26.5% on Thursday at $10.05, well below its 2021 peak of $27.26 reached on July 6, although still above the June 23 close of $1.71.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Thursday, as upbeat quarterly results from corporates weren't enough to shake the broader market out of its malaise ahead of data due Friday expected to show a rebound in retail sales .
The S&P 500 fell 0.33%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.15%, or 54 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.70%.
Banks continued to report quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations, helping financials snap out of their recent malaise even as U.S. bond yields continued to make losses.  The 10-year yield hit its lowest since mid-February.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) ended modestly higher after reporting second-quarter results that beat expectations on the both the top and bottom lines as strength in equities trading and investment banking fees bolstered performance.
The regional banks, however, fared better with U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) topping Wall Street estimates, sending both shares more than 2% higher.
But the backdrop of positive quarterly results did little to spark a bid in the broader market as energy and tech stocks led the downside.
Energy stocks declined more than 1% paced by a fall in oil prices on expectations for further supply after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly reached a compromise that should lead to an easing of production curbs.
The major cap tech stocks struggled to keep up their recent momentum.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT were in the red.
On the economic front, the recovery in the labor market continues to gather pace as jobless claims fell to a pandemic low.
Initial jobless claims fell 26,000 to 360,000 from an upwardly-revised 386,000 in the week ending July 10.
“There was a noticeable reversal of progress in the claims data in mid-June, but the data of the last three weeks suggests that the recovery is back on track,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The malaise in the broader market comes just a day before the release of the retail sales data that will serve as a gauge for the health of the consumer. Retail sales are expected to have declined 0.4% in June following a 1.3% decline in May.
The consumer, which makes up two thirds of the economic growth, is expected to keep the economy humming along, and take up the supportive void expected to be left by the Fed when the central bank eventually begins to tighten monetary policy.
“In a K-shape recovery [...] you need to consumers to come in and be healthy and provide support, because there has to be a handoff from, from a Fed-supported economy to a consumer-supported economy,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETF told Investing.com earlier this week.
Looking ahead, some are forecasting a big move in equities ahead including a possible correction. 
""Based on technical setups and the current macro environment, we could see some explosive moves in U.S. equities in the coming weeks, in our opinion. This could include a bigger correction on the S&P 500 than experienced thus far this year- where we continue to watch for the possibility of a 10% decline (potentially more) in the second half of the year,"" according to Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategy of Janney Montgomery Scott."

By Matt Scuffham and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pandemic-era trading boom has started to slow down for Wall Street banks, reviving pressure on icons like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to reinvent those businesses.
The COVID-19 pandemic transformed banks' trading desks, which had struggled with lethargic revenue growth in the years since the 2007-09 financial crisis as tougher regulations and technological advancements crimped margins.
From being the laggard in most investment banks, traders took center stage last year, generating bumper revenue and profits as clients scrambled to reposition their portfolios in highly volatile markets.
A massive injection of cash into capital markets by the Federal Reserve led to unprecedented liquidity and trading activity as investors sought opportunities to cash in.
But with activity returning to more-normal levels, discussion is returning to how trading businesses will evolve and the strategies adopted by banks most reliant upon them.
""At some point the Fed is going to stop and when it does you're going to go back to the core issue of how to make money in this business,"" said Dick Bove, a longtime bank analyst with Odeon Capital Group. ""There has to be a restructuring of trading businesses because I don't think in their current form they offer attractive growth going forward.""
The biggest U.S. banks reported a slump in revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading in the second quarter, facing tough comparisons in the same period last year, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, sending markets into a frenzy.
Equities trading held up better, with three of the five U.S. investment banks seeing higher revenue.
Despite that, executives remain unsure about what the ""new normal"" will be for trading activity and when the market will settle at that level.
""We are all trying to figure that out,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview.
Although overall trading revenue dropped by around a third from this time last year, it remains well above pre-pandemic levels for the largest Wall Street banks.
""We're not going back to 2019 levels anytime soon,"" said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon in an interview with CNBC.
Executives at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley point to a larger overall market and an increase in their market share as European rivals retreat and they to more trading on behalf of corporate clients.
""The (FICC) wallet feels bigger than it was pre-pandemic,"" said Morgan Stanley's Yeshaya. ""We are capturing a bigger share than we had before.""
However, some analysts are skeptical.
""I would be cautious to say the size of that market has increased,"" said Mark Doctoroff, MUFG's global co-head of financial institutions group.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - the banks that are most reliant on capital markets - will face challenges as market activity returns to more normal levels, analysts say.

Those banks have benefited more than others as the trading and investment banking boom of the past year drove their earnings growth and gave a sharp boost to their share prices.
Morgan Stanley shares now trade at more than three times their value at the start of the pandemic. Goldman Sachs' shares are worth nearly three times what they were when COVID-19 hit.

So, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound financial stocks  Capital One  Financial (COF), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), and OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF). They are currently trading below their 52-week highs. Read on for more details.The financial sector was one of the hardest-hit sectors last year as the near-zero interest rate environment and fewer financial transactions amid the recession diminished the revenues of financial companies significantly, particularly banks and insurers. While the interest-rate environment remains unchanged, the sector is now witnessing a solid recovery on the back of increasing financial transactions and capital market activities. Investors’ interest in the financial sector is evident in the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLF) 23.8% gains year-to-date versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 16.7% returns.
Adding to the positives, the Federal Reserve has hinted at raising interest rates as soon as late 2023, a year earlier than originally anticipated, which should help financial companies expand their profit margins. Furthermore, the sector is expected to grow with the ongoing digital transformation. According to The Business Research Company, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to $22.5 trillion in 2021.
With these factors in mind, we believe established financial companies Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), and OneMain Holdings, Inc.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 12:47PM ET</span>",From Soho to Wall Street: Membership Collective shares fall in debut,"(Reuters) -Shares of Soho House private members club fell 6% in their New York Stock Exchange debut on Thursday, giving the company formally known as Membership Collective Group a market valuation of about $2.6 billion.
The company, which has never turned a profit, sold 30 million shares in its initial public offering (IPO) at the bottom of its $14 to $16 target price range. Its stock opened at $13.5. 
Founder Nick Jones opened the maiden Soho House on the first floor of a building in London's Greek Street in 1995 as a space for the local artists and actors that frequented his downstairs restaurant.
The club in 2003 started its first U.S. house in New York's Meatpacking District and entered Europe seven years later with a space in Berlin. The house in Germany was originally a department store whose Jewish owners were forced out by the Nazis in 1933, and the Soviet Communist Party later took over the building. 
It now has more than 119,000 members across 27 houses in 10 countries, with more openings in Europe, Asia, and North America on the horizon. It also operates London's The Ned, a club for professionals, and the Scorpios Beach Club in Mykonos.
Soho House's listing comes at a time when unprecedented government stimulus has created a record appetite for IPOs, prompting scores of start-ups to go public.
The company plans to launch a digital-only membership in late 2021, which will allow members to search for and be recommended to other members, besides being able to communicate through direct messaging, audio and video.

Its majority owner Yucaipa Companies, the private equity firm founded by American billionaire Ron Burkle, has 58.1% of the combined voting power in the company post the offering.
J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

ROME (Reuters) -Carrier Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) will replace state-owned Alitalia and start flying in mid-October after Italy reached a long-awaited deal with the European Commission following months of haggling over the fate of the old, loss-making airline.
The negotiations focused on making ITA independent of Alitalia to ensure it was not liable for paying back billions of euros the old carrier had received in state aid.
ITA, which will be fully operational from Oct. 15, said in a statement it will aim to raise initial capital of 700 million euros ($826.70 million) to buy assets from the old company and begin operating.
Following the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry, demand is beginning to recover but companies are still grounding many aircraft or flying nearly empty 
The new airline, which was initially supposed to start operating in April, said it expected revenue of just above 3.3 billion euros in 2025. It added it would reach earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 209 million euros and a break-even by the third quarter of 2023.
ITA will buy assets for its aviation business directly from Alitalia and it will bid in a public tender to acquire the carrier's brand, which it sees as ""an essential element in carrying out its industrial plan"" and was one of the European Union requirements for the deal.
The outcome of the negotiations also means ITA will inherit only part of Alitalia's flight slots, which are a major asset and proved a major sticking point in the talks. 
ITA will get 85% of the Alitalia slots at Milan's Linate airport and 43% at Rome's Fiumicino hub.
The European Commission said it would remain in close contact with Rome to ensure that the launch of ITA would be in line with EU state aid rules.
It added that its investigations into the 1.3 billion euros granted to Alitalia were ongoing.
JOB CONCERNS
Transport Minister Enrico Giovannini said the new company would be competitive in the national and international market and would have ""significant development perspectives"", but some members of the coalition government complained the new plan was not strong enough.
National unions for the airline sector strongly rejected ITA's plan, describing it as weak and saying the employment commitments were unacceptable. 
ITA will initially operate a fleet of 52 planes, seven of which are wide-body, used for longer-haul routes. The number is expected to increase progressively to 105 aircraft in 2025. 
Of the 11,000-strong Alitalia staff, between 2,750 and 2,950 will be employed in the ITA's aviation unit this year, rising to 5,550-5,700 in 2025.
Up to 4,000 workers will likely be hired in handling and maintenance units.

An industry ministry statement said it would ""take charge of the social repercussions ... activating safeguards to support the workers who will not find a place in the new company"".

However, easing restrictions with progress on the vaccination front, and pent-up demand for travel, should bolster the industry’s rebound. Given that travel spending is expected to surge this year, we believe the price dips in the shares of Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD),  Vera Bradley  (NASDAQ:VRA), and Full House Resorts (NASDAQ:FLL) make them solid picks now. Read on.The global travel and tourism industry was among the worst hit industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to the travel restrictions that most countries imposed to contain the virus’ spread. But the industry has been seeing a decent recovery lately thanks to a fast-paced economic recovery and easing travel restrictions facilitated by significant progress on the COVID-19 vaccination front worldwide.
According to the U.S. Travel Association, domestic travel spending is expected to surge 22.5% year-over-year to $787 billion in 2021. The pent-up demand for leisure travel is expected to be the major contributor to this growth. 
So, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound travel and tourism stocks Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD), Vera Bradley Inc. (VRA), and  Full House Resorts Inc . (FLL). They are each trading below their recent highs.

And we think investors’ expectation of higher rates could drive the performance of SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT) in the near term. Read on to learn more.The Federal Reserve expects at least two hikes in its benchmark interest rates by late 2023, according to its recent dot plot charts. In fact, seven of the 18 members of the Federal Open Markets Operations Committee (FOMC) anticipate a hike in the benchmark rate sometime next year.
While the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expects the prevailing inflation rate to be transitory, he stated in recent testimony to the U.S. Congress that the FOMC will use its tools to guide inflation back down in the event that the Fed’s narrative does not play out as it anticipates. Thus, because consumer prices increased 5.4% last month, representing the biggest monthly gain since August 2008, the economy might witness a sooner-than-expected hike in interest rates.
Because higher interest rates typically help banks generate higher interest income, investors expecting a rate hike will likely bet on bank stocks in the near- to midterm. As such, we think that SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT) could witness a solid rally.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 12:28PM ET</span>",Microsoft says Israeli group sold tools to hack Windows,"By Christopher Bing
(Reuters) - An Israeli group sold a tool to hack into Microsoft Windows, Microsoft and technology human rights group Citizen Lab said on Thursday, shedding light on the growing business of finding and selling tools to hack widely used software.
The hacking tool vendor, named Candiru, created and sold a software exploit that can penetrate Windows, one of many intelligence products sold by a secretive industry that finds flaws in common software platforms for their clients, said a report by Citizen Lab. 
Technical analysis by security researchers details how Candiru's hacking tool spread around the globe to numerous unnamed customers, where it was then used to target various civil society organizations, including a Saudi dissident group and a left-leaning Indonesian news outlet, the reports by Citizen Lab and Microsoft show.
Attempts to reach Candiru for comment were unsuccesful. 
Evidence of the exploit recovered by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) suggested it was deployed against users in several countries, including Iran, Lebanon, Spain and the United Kingdom, according to the Citizen Lab report. 
""Candiru's growing presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,"" Citizen Lab said in its report. 
Microsoft fixed the discovered flaws on Tuesday through a software update. Microsoft did not directly attribute the exploits to Candiru, instead referring to it as an ""Israel-based private sector offensive actor"" under the codename Sourgum.
""Sourgum generally sells cyberweapons that enable its customers, often government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and internet-connected devices,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post. ""These agencies then choose who to target and run the actual operations themselves."" 
Candiru's tools also exploited weaknesses in other common software products, like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Chrome browser. 
On Wednesday, Google released a blog post where it disclosed two Chrome software flaws that Citizen Lab found connected to Candiru. Google also did not refer to Candiru by name, but described it as a ""commercial surveillance company."" Google patched the two vulnerabilities earlier this year. 
Cyber arms dealers like Candiru often chain multiple software vulnerabilities together to create effective exploits that can reliably break into computers remotely without a target's knowledge, computer security experts say. 

Those types of covert systems cost millions of dollars and are often sold on a subscription basis, making it necessary for customers to repeatedly pay a provider for continued access, people familiar with the cyber arms industry told Reuters. 
""No longer do groups need to have the technical expertise, now they just need resources,"" Google wrote in its blog post.

(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) said it needed more time to determine its coverage policy for Biogen's recently approved $56,000 Alzheimer's disease drug Aduhelm that is expected to raise costs for the U.S. government Medicare program.
The government's Medicare program and private health insurers such as UnitedHealth, which sell Medicare Advantage plans for those aged above 65 and are known to be susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, will be affected as they will have to bear most of the drug cost.
UnitedHealth said it was awaiting guidance on coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which earlier this week began its review process to cover the drug's cost under the Medicare program.
Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s shares dropped about 5% after the comments on Aduhelm, which won the U.S. health regulator's nod last month despite strong objection from its expert advisory panel over lack of sufficient clinical evidence on the drug's effectiveness.
Wall Street analysts estimated peak annual sales of $10 billion to $50 billion for Aduhelm.
UnitedHealth on Thursday also raised its full-year earnings target for the second time this year, after a strong performance mainly in its Optum unit helped it beat second-quarter profit expectations. 
The 2021 profit forecast of $18.30 to $18.80 per share includes a potential negative impact of $1.80 per share related to COVID-19 costs, which the company expects to record mostly in the back-half of the year.  

The guidance was conservative and leaves room for potential deferred care or COVID-19 costs in the back half of the year given uncertainty around the pandemic, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said.
The company said use of healthcare services, which trended below normal levels as patients put off non-urgent care during the height of pandemic, rebounded close to usual levels in the second quarter, especially in its employer-sponsored health plan business.

The nascent psychedelic treatment market has seen investor demand surge over the last year as multiple studies have shown psilocybin, an active compound in magic mushrooms, is effective in treating depression and other mental afflictions.
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel-backed psychedelics startup, atai Life Sciences, a company that Palo Santo has also invested in, debuted on the Nasdaq with a market value of $3.2 billion last month.
""Palo Santo is seeing far more unique, high quality investment opportunities than we would have anticipated at this stage of the cycle and is therefore evaluating upsizing this current fund,"" said Tim Schlidt, the co-founder of Palo Santo.
The company had initially planned to raise $30 million.
The psychedelic fund will be an active participant and work with the managements of the companies it invests in, said Schlidt, a former healthcare banker, in an interview with Reuters.
The fund will mainly invest in companies that are in the early stages of their fundraising, but could eventually begin investing in the late-stage rounds as well, co-founder Daniel Goldberg said.
He added the fund would also look to invest in companies whose operations go beyond just the production of psilocybin and focus on the development of new compounds based on it or its delivery methods.

Investing.com – U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock rose nearly 4% Thursday as the bank’s second-quarter earnings and revenue both beat estimates.
The lender posted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 on revenue of $5.78 billion. This beat the $1.12 EPS that was supposed to come on an estimated revenue of $5.62 billion.
Profits got a boost from the release of $350 million from loss reserves due to improving economic outlook and credit trends.
The company’s payments business boomed as customers, coming out of a pandemic and loaded on government stimulus, took to spending in a big way.
Revenue in the credit and debit card business rose almost 40% from a year ago to $396 million.
Non-interest income, which the payments business is part of, also benefited in revenue from prepaid card processing activities related to government stimulus programs as well as stronger transaction and cash advance fees and higher merchant processing services revenue.
Non-interest revenue was offset by commercial products business due to lower capital markets activity and trading revenue."

So, let’s pore over these names.With infrastructure nationwide—such as power grids, public transportation and high-speed internet access—in need of maintenance, repair and reconstruction, the industry has enjoyed heightened investor attention over the past few months with the reopening of the economy. This is evident in the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF’s (PAVE) and the iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF’s (IFRA) 20.7% and 16.6% returns, respectively, so far this year.
Further, the industry received a boost last month when President Biden reached an agreement with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators on a $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending proposal. So, the industry should remain in focus as the Senate works to pass the bill.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound infrastructure stocks Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) (OC), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX), Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Beyond Meat said on Thursday it has launched an online store in China on JD (NASDAQ:JD).com's ecommerce platform, as the plant-based meatmaker aims to boost sales in the world's biggest meat market where consumer interest in meat alternatives is low.
U.S.-based Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) said in a statement the JD.com store will initially help expand availability of its products in four major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, and eventually in 300 cities across China.
JD.com's 18 cold chain warehouses will provide delivery of Beyond Meat products to consumers within 48 hours of orders being placed, it said. 
Its products are mainly available in China through its partnerships with  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's Freshippo markets. 
But expanding into the retail segment by selling on JD.com will help it reach a wider audience in the country, which is increasingly purchasing fresh food online. Online sales in China of fresh food, into which category Beyond Meat's products fall, are expected to top 300 billion yuan ($46.40 billion) this year, an increase of 18% from 2020, according to consultancy iiMedia Research. Beyond Meat's direct retail foray follows a similar move by Nestle in December, which launched a range of plant-based burgers, sausages, nuggets and dishes suited to Chinese cooking. The push by global firms comes even as consumers in China are not exactly devouring plant-based meat. ""Currently, it is a solo dance by the manufacturers, the consumers are not joining the tango,"" said Zhu Danpeng, an independent food industry analyst. Chinese consumers are deterred by concerns over food safety as well as taste, said Zhu.
A recent poll on the Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform found only 14% of 400 participants were willing to try plant-based meat.
Nevertheless, the promise of a market with 1.4 billion people is enticing for the companies.
Beyond Meat, which has set up its first manufacturing plant outside of the United States in the eastern Chinese city of Jiaxing, near Shanghai, declined to comment on its sales in the market. A 0.454 kg twin pack of plant-based beef will be sold at 210 yuan on the company's JD store. By comparison, 1 kg of good quality domestic beef costs about 140 yuan on JD's fresh food platform.
""We see that Chinese consumers pay more and more attention to healthy diet and lifestyle,"" James Ye, general manager of JD Fresh said. ""Via our long-established advantages in supply chain, cold chain logistics, retail and omni-channels, we hope to bring Beyond Meat's healthy and high-quality products to Chinese consumers.""
Liu Yiping, a 45-year-old businessman in Beijing, said he likes the sandwich with Beyond Meat at Starbucks.

""I tried it for fun as I wonder how the taste will be,"" he said. ""It is not bad but still won't make me try the second time as it is not cheap."" Beyond Meat is also adding Beyond Pork, created for the pork-loving Chinese market, to its offering on JD.com. It will also sell ingredients that are used in the cooking of local dishes such as stir-fry, dumplings, mapo tofu, zhajiang noodles and lion's head meatballs to appeal to Chinese consumers.

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit announced further senior management changes on Thursday as new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel presses ahead with plans to streamline the bank ahead of any eventual merger.
In May, less than a month after taking the job, Orcel reshaped top management, overhauling a structure designed by his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier. 
""Today's announcement is a further step in delivering on our objective to simplify and reduce the complexity that has shaped this business for too long,"" Orcel said in a statement.
Orcel arrived in mid-April after UniCredit's board fell out with his predecessor over strategy. 
The bank is struggling with profitability after Mustier, a French investment banker, focused on repairing its balance sheet and shoring up capital reserves while failing to land a mooted cross-border merger.
Orcel, who is due to present a new business plan this year, has not ruled out possible mergers and acquisitions to help boost profit but is looking first to shake out bureaucracy. 
""My focus for UniCredit at the moment is on the internal ... Not on the external, that is ... merely an accelerator,"" he said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Thursday.
UniCredit has been linked with a possible takeover of Italy's state-owned Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which Rome is looking to offload.
The latest move redesigns front-line management for each of the bank's business areas and regions to ""reduce layering and complexities"", UniCredit said in a statement. 
In Italy, Barbara Tamburini will head the so-called Individuals operation, which includes the Mass Market, Affluent and Private Clients businesses, while Andrea Casini takes charge of the Enterprises operation. 
Alfredo De Falco will lead Corporate Investment Banking (CIB) for Italy.
In Germany, Markus Beumer and Jan Kupfer will head the Enterprises and CIB units, respectively, while the new head of the Individuals unit will be announced in the near future, UniCredit said. 

In Eastern and Central Europe, Pierre Yves Guegan will manage the retail business while Fabio Fornaroli will lead CIB. 
The new structure also increases the diversity of the management team, mirroring the larger female presence on the group's executive committee, now up to 40% from the previous 15%.

By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook wants his employees back in the office sooner than many of his peers.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) CEO Jane Fraser is bucking a trend on Wall Street by giving her employees more flexibility in returning than her major rivals.
The questions of if, when and how often white-collar employees should again work in the office have been vexing corporate America ever since COVID-19 vaccinations became available. Once safety hurdles were cleared, CEOs began to craft policies based on culture and business needs.
Now even companies in the same sector often take different approaches, underscoring how the personal preferences of their bosses are informing these key decisions.
""It's hard to unravel the character and personality of a CEO from the culture they grew up in,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University professor who runs leadership and networking programs for executives. 
The vast majority of U.S. office workers will be called back to physical locations this year, with about two-thirds of companies planning a full or hybrid return to work, according to an April survey by accounting and consulting firm Deloitte. About 25% of U.S. companies have already reopened their offices, according to the survey.

(Graphic: Percent of industries planning a hybrid workforce after pandemic: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/COMPANIES-OFFICE/dgkplrodepb/chart.png)
While the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have asked their workers to return to the office by the end of the summer, if not sooner, Fraser has told most employees they can work in the office three days a week come September.
Advocates of this approach say the Scottish 54-year-old executive's message of flexibility will appeal more to workers than the line taken by her counterparts on Wall Street, where up to 80-hour work weeks took their toll during the pandemic.
Fraser issued a March memo acknowledging the burden the pandemic put on employees and calling for Zoom-free Fridays, a reset day and for limits on after-hours calls. She has talked about how working part-time as a consultant to juggle parenting two children and her career did not stop her from becoming the first female CEO of a major U.S. bank.
""Citigroup is taking a very deliberate view on what their culture needs to be in the future,"" said Steve Hatfield, who works for Deloitte and advises companies on workplace practices.
Citi's global head of human resources Sara Wechter posted on professional networking site LinkedIn that workers who are not vaccinated will have to use an at-home rapid COVID-19 test three times a week and wear masks.
Citi declined to comment beyond its public statements.
Apple's Cook, 60, known for working long hours, has gone against the trend in the technology industry, which had the fewest employees on site among all major sectors, according to the Deloitte survey. 
Cook asked Apple employees to return to the office a minimum of three days a week in the autumn, in a departure from the stance of other big technology firms that are permitting full remote work. 
His decision triggered a backlash among some Apple employees, who penned a letter asking him to reconsider. He has held firm. He had originally planned a summer return but bumped the deadline out until the fall. 
Cook also comes from the Apple culture that has emphasized in-person collaboration. When late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs helped design the company's circle-shaped $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, California, he intended in part to have employees walk around the ring and bump into each other, spurring impromptu collaboration across teams. 
Apple declined to comment.
CANVASSING WORKERS
Other technology CEOs have embraced the virtual office. Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff spent a portion of the COVID-19 lockdown at his home in Hawaii, and also worked around the globe before the pandemic, rather than exclusively in the company's San Francisco headquarters, people familiar with the matter said. 
Salesforce has been hosting calls every week with all employees, a spokeswoman said.
Leaders at the company aim to make Salesforce employees feel part of the corporate ""ohana"" -- Hawaiian for family -- and have been canvassing workers on their thoughts, said board director Alan Hassenfeld. 

In its return-to-office plans, the software provider is deeming most employees flex workers, who will be in the office one to three days per week, according to a company spokeswoman. 
""The return to the office has everything to do with the personality of the CEO, because it has to do with the company culture, and the culture comes from the very top,"" said Glenn Gow, a business coach who helps CEOs.

With corporations and financial institutions under growing pressure from investors to up their environment, social and governance (ESG) game, the issuance of bonds to raise money for climate-related or social projects, or linked to sustainability targets, is an increasingly popular option.
Sustainable debt sales more than doubled year-on-year in the first half of 2021 to over $680 billion, closing in on the $700 billion issued during the whole of last year.
""With Net Zero commitments in the spotlight, an acceleration in low-carbon energy investment and technological innovation has been supporting ESG securities issuance, along with strong investor appetite,"" said IIF economist Khadija Mahmood. 
The latest issuance bonanza will see the total market size grow to well above $3 trillion during this year, the IIF found. 
Green bonds, which are used to finance climate-related or environmental projects, made up the lion's share of all new issuance, at 35%, led by Germany, China and France. 
While sovereigns, financial institutions and utilities dominate issuance, firms from elsewhere in the energy sphere as well as materials and consumer discretionary sector increasingly joined the fray. 
Other types of debt falling into the sustainable category also recorded stellar issuance in the first half of the year.
Issuance of social bonds, which raise funds for projects with positive social outcomes, more than tripled year on year to $140 billion, boosted in part by the European Union's introduction of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) which imposes mandatory ESG disclosure obligations.
Sales of sustainability-linked bonds, where an issuer pledges to reach specific ESG targets or face, for example, higher coupon payments - rose nearly four times to $160 billion. 
Sustainability bond issuance, which can raise funds for a mix of projects, surged to $90 billion in the first six months of 2021, with the dollar replacing the euro as the main funding currency.
Meanwhile issuers from developing countries had some catching up to do.
""Emerging markets still represent less than 15% of the sustainable debt universe,"" said Mahmood. 

China, Chile, Turkey and Mexico are the biggest issuers currently.

Investment banking hauled in $2.38 billion in revenue, according to a statement Thursday, vaulting past analysts’ estimates of $2.08 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue tumbled 45% from last year’s pandemic-driven surge.Morgan Stanley’s results echo an investment-banking bonanza reported by rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). earlier this week. The firms capitalized as corporations looking for merger-and-acquisition opportunities sought out advice from Wall Street. Investment banking has been a wild card for Morgan Stanley’s earnings, a contrast to the steady growth engine of the firm’s wealth-management operation.
“We had another strong quarter and we are firing on all cylinders,” Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview. “The fixed-income decline was in line with peers, investment-banking pipelines are strong. We had record revenue in wealth management” and a profit margin of almost 28%.
Morgan Stanley was little changed at $92.38 at 9:51 a.m. in New York trading. The stock has surged 35% this year as the bank doubled its quarterly dividend and announced as much as $12 billion in stock buybacks after comfortably clearing the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests.
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman unveiled his biggest leadership shakeup in more than a decade during the second quarter, positioning four men as his most likely successors. Prominent among them were Ted Pick, the architect of Morgan Stanley’s trading revival in recent years, and Andy Saperstein, who built the company into a wealth-management powerhouse. Pick and Saperstein were tapped as co-presidents.Yeshaya on Thursday will make her debut presentation to Wall Street analysts on the firm’s performance and outlook.
The company said net income in the second quarter reached $3.48 billion, the second-best on record, after the $4 billion notched in the first quarter.
Within the investment-banking division, advisory-fee revenue jumped 44% and equity underwriting climbed 22% to $1.07 billion.
Several banks have raced to announce pay hikes for junior bankers to prevent defections and attract talent. But Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have so far steered clear of extending such perks to their youngest hires.
Trading revenue industrywide has fallen from the elevated levels seen last year, and Morgan Stanley didn’t escape that fate. Its trading desk posted $1.68 billion in fixed-income revenue, down from $3.04 billion a year earlier and below the $1.91 billion analysts were expecting.
But the New York-based firm regained its top position in equity trading after ceding the crown to Goldman Sachs in the first quarter, when Morgan Stanley got burned by its ties to Archegos Capital Management. Wealth management churned out $6.09 billion in revenue. Gorman has been vocal about his goal of managing about $10 trillion across the wealth and asset-management business, compared with $6 trillion the firm managed at the end of June. Results were bolstered by a $10 billion increase in lending to wealthy clients and $34 billion in fee-based inflows for the three-month period.
Morgan Stanley is turning to the business of managing money for wealthy individuals and clients for an increasing share of its total revenue, a trend highlighted by last year’s deals to purchase  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) and E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Uniqlo owner trims profit forecast on new COVID-19 curbs,"By Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Fast Retailing, owner of clothing brand Uniqlo, trimmed its profit outlook for the year, saying additional government restrictions in Japan and other markets to contain fresh COVID-19 infections has slowed customer traffic in stores.
Last week, Japan, where the company operates some 800 Uniqlo stores, declared a fourth coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo, just two weeks before the Olympic Games are due to begin. 
""With the declaration of a state of emergency again, it is expected that customers' willingness to go out and shop will be more restrained,"" Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki told reporters in Tokyo. ""We expect that trend will continue for the time being, so we have revised our business forecast to reflect this.""
Fast Retailing said on Thursday it now expects operating profit for the fiscal year ending August to rise 64% year-over-year to 245 billion yen ($2.23 billion), versus a previous estimate of 255 billion yen.
Profit rose to 227.9 billion yen in the nine months ended May from 134.4 billion yen in the year-earlier period that was hit hard by the coronavirus crisis.
The interim results were bolstered by strong sales of masks, lounge wear and other goods that befitted the stay-at-home lifestyle of the pandemic. 
The company has been among the more resilient retailers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Uniqlo's focus on China and Japan helped it escape the worst of the downturn in the United States and Europe.
But the company had to deal with crises in Myanmar and China that upset supply lines and created reputational challenges.
Earlier this year, it was forced to halt operations at some partner facilities in Myanmar, where a military coup has led to social unrest.
In China, the company and other foreign brands are facing customer backlash over criticisms of alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province. Fast Retailing operates about 800 Uniqlo stores on the mainland.
Chief executive Tadashi Yanai has declined to comment on Xinjiang issues, saying his company remains politically neutral.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Sydney Airport rejects $17 billion buyout proposal amid deal frenzy,"By Jamie Freed and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Sydney Airport Holdings Pty Ltd said on Thursday it would reject a A$22.26 billion ($16.6 billion) takeover proposal from a group of infrastructure funds, the biggest of a frenzy of Australian deals fuelled by record-low interest rates.
The operator of Australia's largest airport said directors had unanimously concluded the proposal undervalued the airport and was not in the best interest of shareholders. If successful, it would have been one of Australia's biggest buyouts.
Record-low interest rates have prompted pension funds and their investment managers to chase higher yields, leading to recent asset purchases from Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) Corp and Qube Holdings.
Electricity poles-and-wires company Spark Infrastructure Group rejected a A$4.91 billion buyout proposal from private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board but left open the chance of some engagement.
Last week, the Sydney Aviation Alliance, a consortium of IFM Investors, QSuper and Global Infrastructure Partners offered A$8.25 a share, for a premium of 42% to pandemic-ravaged Sydney Airport's last trading price before the offer.
Shares of Sydney Airport were flat at about A$7.80, a sign the market expects further negotiations.
The proposal is contingent on a board recommendation and access to due diligence. Sydney Airport said its board would only accept a buyout deal that would ""deliver and recognise appropriate long-term value"".
""The board is obviously trying to play hardball, but we do think it's a pretty unique long-dated asset so we are supportive of their decision so far,"" Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, a top-20 investor in the airport, told Reuters.
In a statement, the Sydney Aviation Alliance said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the rejection, but did not say if it had ruled out a higher offer.
The Australian government has a foreign ownership cap of 49% on airport operators. IFM, QSuper and UniSuper are Australian, while Global Infrastructure Partners is from the United States.
Sydney Airport is Australia's only listed airport operator and a purchase would be a long-term bet on the travel sector. The city's lockdown will run at least two more weeks after a rise in COVID-19 infections.
A successful deal would bring its ownership in line with the country's other major airports, which are owned by consortia of infrastructure investors, primarily pension funds.
Australia's mandatory retirement savings system, known as superannuation, has assets of A$3.1 trillion, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.
A Sydney Airport purchase, with an enterprise value of A$30 billion including debt, would position it to reap financial benefits when borders reopen.
If successful, the purchase would be one of Australia's largest by enterprise value in U.S. dollar terms, on par with the $22-billion purchase of mall operator Westfield Group by Unibail-Rodamco (AS:URW) in 2017, Refinitiv data showed.
It would require the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board and Australia's competition regulator. 
Cross-ownership rules may compel IFM to sell down a portion of its holdings in other major Australian airports,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rob Koh said.
""It may be there is a series of further airport transactions as a result of this,"" Koh said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Wednesday, adding that co-owners who probably have pre-emptive rights would be logical buyers.
Last week, Bloomberg News said a consortium led by Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) was considering a rival offer, citing unidentified sources. With talks at an early stage, Macquarie could also consider joining the Sydney Aviation Alliance, it added.

In a note,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said there was potential for other bidders, such as Macquarie, Australia Super and the Future Fund, to get involved. Macquarie once owned Sydney Airport and the rest have stakes in other Australian airports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, with semiconductor names underperforming after one of the world's biggest chipmakers said an end to the current supply squeeze was on the horizon. 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) CEO CC Wei told analysts on a call that he expected chip deliveries to carmakers in particular to pick up sharply in the current quarter and over the rest of the year. The news was seen as spelling an end to the windfall that chipmakers have enjoyed in the first six months of 2021. Auto production fell 6.6% in June due to chip shortages, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report on industrial production. That ensured that overall production growth fell short of expectations at only 0.4%.
TSM shares were among the biggest losers in early trading, falling 5.5%, but other chipmakers suffered too:  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) stock fell 4.5%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock fell 1.9% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 1.3%.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102 points, or 0.3%, at 34,830 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock gained a modest 0.8%, after making a hire that suggests it wants to add videogame streaming to its platform. Analysts expressed skepticism that the owners of the most popular video game franchises would be willing to allow it onto their turf. The stock nonetheless also got an upgrade from analysts at UBS, on the view that new subscriptions will start accelerating again.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 0.3% despite not being able to escape the trend of a quarter that saw weak bond trading conditions hamper overall profitability on Wall Street. The 45% drop in income from trading fixed-income, currencies and commodities was at the weaker end of the peer group's range. 
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock also fell 3.8% after the New York Times reported that two major clinics - Mount Sinai and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - have refused to administer its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, adding to the controversy over its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), the country's largest hospital operator, said on a call that it still hadn't decided on a policy toward the drug. UnitedHealth stock fell 0.6% after its profit fell 36% in the second quarter, a consequence of its operating costs returning to normal levels after the widespread cancellation of elective procedures a year ago, in the first phase of the pandemic.
Earlier, the latest weekly jobless claims numbers indicated that the labor market recovery is grinding on, rather than roaring ahead. Initial jobless claims fell to 360,000 as expected, while the total number of people claiming some sort of dole fell under 14 million. "

Calvey, the founder of Russia-focused private equity group Baring Vostok was detained along with other executives in early 2019 on charges of embezzlement linked to mid-sized lender Vostochny. He and the executives deny the charges. 
The detention of the Wisconsin-born investor rattled Russia's business community and prompted several prominent officials and businessmen to voice concerns about the way the state deals with commercial disputes and executives caught up in them.

Calvey was subsequently freed from jail and put under house arrest, which was lifted last November. 
The prosecutor also asked the court to hand French national Philippe Delpal, a partner at the fund, a five-year suspended sentence.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>","Big banks seek to curb ""speculative"" planned UK forex class action","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A proposed multi-billion pound claim against powerful banks over alleged foreign exchange (forex) rigging is too weak and speculative to be allowed to proceed as a U.S.-style class action, the banks' lawyer told a London court on Wednesday.
Brian Kennelly said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), UBS, NatWest and MUFG Bank were not trying to stifle or delay any lawsuit that might be brought by thousands of claimants.
But he told a five-day hearing at London's specialist Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), to determine whether a class action can proceed: ""We say the weaker the claims or more complex or difficult the claims, the more appropriate it is to try them in 'opt in' proceedings.""
Critics of U.S.-style ""opt out"" class actions, which automatically bind a defined group into a lawsuit unless individuals opt out, say they can lead to vast claims, claims without merit and lush profits for litigators and their funders.
Proponents say they allow easier access to justice, as some individual claims are too small to pursue individually, provide a deterrent against misconduct and that ""opt in"" lawsuits, where every claimant signs up, are costly and time-consuming.
Bank forex customers are also worried they risk damaging banking relationships if they actively participate in an opt-in lawsuit, according to court filings. But Kennelly questioned why banks would risk losing customers.
Investment banks across the globe have paid more than a combined $11 billion in fines to settle U.S. and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged forex markets.
But it was the European Commission that paved the way for this proposed lawsuit by fining banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2019 over two forex cartels, dubbed ""Essex Express"" and ""Three Way Banana Split"", between 2007 and 2013.
Michael O'Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog The Pensions Regulator, and Phillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at the Competition Markets Authority, are now vying to lead a class action on behalf of claimants such as asset managers, pension funds and financial institutions.
Foreign exchange is the crown jewel of London's financial sector. Around 43% percent of the $8.3 trillion-per-day forex market is traded in the city.

O'Higgins has instructed U.S. law firm Scott & Scott while Evans is being advised by Hausfeld - the two litigators that co-led a similar U.S. case against 15 banks and helped secure $2.3 billion in settlements for American claimants.
The CAT will decide whether to allow a planned lawsuit to proceed as a so-called collective action and which, if any, class representative should lead it.

By a 3-1 vote, the CPSC voted to file an administrative complaint saying the Seattle-based e-commerce giant was legally responsible to recall the products as they posed a serious risk of injury or death to consumers.
The products included 24,000 carbon monoxide detectors that failed to go off, nearly 400,000 hair dryers that lacked required protection against shock and electrocution, and ""numerous"" children's sleepwear garments that could catch fire, according to the CPSC.
""We must grapple with how to deal with these massive third-party platforms more efficiently, and how best to protect the American consumers who rely on them,"" CPSC Acting Chairman Robert Adler said.
The regulator added that Amazon had taken unspecified actions for some of the products, but it was not enough. (https://refini.tv/2UOb7SV)

Amazon said in a statement it was ""unclear"" why the CPSC rejected its offer to expand its recall program, including for products sold by third parties, or sued to force actions ""almost entirely duplicative"" of what it had taken.
The company said it had removed ""the vast majority"" of the products in question from its store and provided full customer refunds.

Investing.com –  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock fell more than 1% in Thursday’s premarket after the bank followed its peers in reporting a quarter marked by a sharp drop in bond trading revenues.
Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 45% in the second quarter to $1.68 billion from $3.04 billion a year earlier. That was at the weak end of the range reported by its peer group. All its other segments hummed, however.
The bank attributed the fall in fixed-income trading revenue to narrower bid-offer spreads and tighter credit spreads, as volatility in the bond markets eased after a nervous start to the year. The quarter also had a tough comparison base, given the hectic activity last year at the start of the pandemic.
The bank reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $14.75 in the second quarter against EPS of $1.96 on revenue of $13.66 billion in the same period last year.
Both earnings and revenue topped analysts’ expectation who saw them at $1.66 per share and $13.98 billion, respectively.
As previously flagged, the bank said it will double its quarterly dividend to 70 cents a share and expand its buyback program to up to $12 billion, to be carried out over 12 months.
Revenue from investment banking, equity trading, wealth and asset management all recorded growth.

Mercedes-Benz Car and Van results were helped by pricing and cost discipline, helping to offset any impact from a global shortage of semiconductors. Adjusted EBIT for Mercedes-Benz cars and vans was 3.60 billion euros, versus consensus of 3.1 billion euros, it said.
Adjusted EBIT for Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) trucks and buses was 831 million euros, versus consensus of 680 million euros, the company said in a statement.
""Daimler Trucks & Buses sales increased in almost all regions due to improved market conditions, which translated into higher profitability in the second quarter. In addition, the Daimler Trucks & Buses EBIT benefited from strong pricing, higher after sales business and positive, non-recurring valuation effects of around 100 million euros,"" it said.
The overall adjusted EBIT of 5.4 billion euros topped expectations of 4.3 billion, it said.
Daimler's truck unit aims to cut costs and capital expenditure by 15% by 2025 and boost profit margins across all regions regardless of market conditions, it said in May.
The group's preliminary EBIT for the second quarter was 5.19 billion euros. In the second quarter of last year, the company reported an EBIT loss of 1.68 billion euros.
The company's chief financial officer, Harald Wilhelm, last month said Daimler was on track to spin off Daimler Truck, the world's largest truck and bus maker, by the end of the year.
Under the planned spin-off, a significant majority stake in Daimler Truck would be distributed to Daimler shareholders.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Lehman Brothers trader to fintech billionaire: Revolut's Nikolay Storonsky,"LONDON (Reuters) - British-based banking app Revolut's latest $33 billion valuation, achieved after a fresh funding round, has likely made its cofounder and Chief Executive Nik Storonsky a billionaire several times over. 
Russia-born Storonsky, who began his career as a derivatives trader at Lehman Brothers before moving to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) two years later in 2008, was already one of Europe's wealthiest executives on paper thanks to Revolut's rapid growth.
The 36 year-old lost around half a million pounds ($694,450) when his then-employer Lehman collapsed during the financial crisis, he told the Financial Times in an interview in 2018, an incident which he said taught him to ""back up decision making with data and logic"". 
Storonsky left the banking industry in 2013 to found Revolut, one of the first in a wave of digital-only banking apps seeking to undercut mainstream lenders with products such as fee-free foreign exchange for holidaymakers.
It broke from the pack with an early foray into offering cryptocurrencies, scooping up millions of customers in the process.
""The fact that Revolut's valuation has risen 6x in a year where they also reported increased losses will add fuel to the fire that fintech valuations have become overblown,"" said Adam Davis, director of client services at fintech consultancy 11:FS.  
Revolut's growth was fuelled by a hard-charging culture seemingly instilled by Storonsky himself. He has dismissed the value of work-life balance in media interviews and said he typically works from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.
Storonsky has mounted a robust defence of Revolut in the past when it has faced questions over its risk controls, tough workplace culture, and freezing of some customer accounts.
""We are a different company than we were two to three years ago, we’ve learned lessons,” he told Reuters when asked about the problems in a 2019 interview. 
He has also moved to bolster the company's credentials by hiring big names from mainstream finance, bringing in former  Standard Life  (LON:ABDN) Aberdeen co-Chief Executive Martin Gilbert as chairman in November 2019 and former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Michael Sherwood in March last year. 
Married with two children, he studied physics at Moscow's Institute of Physics and Technology, and is a keen kite surfer, mountaineer and championship swimmer, according to the company's website.

Storonsky runs Revolut with co-founder Vladyslav Yatsenko, a software developer who worked at UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Thursday said it will return the option for passengers to book shared rides in select U.S. markets for the first time since the pandemic, when shared trips were scrapped to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Lyft said shared rides, which allow multiple passengers to split a car traveling in the same direction, would become available in Chicago, Philadelphia and Denver as of Monday. The company, which prior to the pandemic operated shared rides in 18 markets, said it plans to return the option to all those cities in the next few months.
Lyft said its mask mandate for drivers and riders remained in effect and that drivers could opt out of offering shared rides. Shared rides would also be limited to two passengers, with the middle and front seats remaining empty.
""As the country reopens, we want our most affordable ride option to be available to our riders,"" Lyft President John Zimmer said in a statement. 
Lyft said it would pursue a phased approach to reintroducing shared rides, taking into account the mix of driver supply and rider demand and local policy on pandemic-related restrictions.
The company's decision comes as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is raising concerns in the United States over a new wave of infections, with only around 59% of all American adults fully vaccinated as of Wednesday https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations. 
Lyft and its larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc suspended shared rides in March 2020.

Shared or pooled rides made up only a small share of pre-pandemic rides, according to U.S. city data, and have traditionally shown higher losses than private rides.
Lyft said its new shared rides product would offer more efficient booking and routing options to avoid delays and keep costs low for riders.

The factories in Dong Nai province, which employ nearly 42,000 workers, will remain shut until July 20, the Vietnamese government said in a statement, adding many of the 177 infection cases detected in the province were from the factories. 
Nike did not respond to Reuters request for comment outside U.S. business hours, while calls to Changshin went unanswered.
On Wednesday, Taiwan's Pou Chen Corp, which makes footwear for Nike Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City. The plant will be closed until July 23 for ""health and safety considerations"", the company said, adding it did not expect a major financial impact.
Vietnam had until recently successfully contained coronavirus outbreaks, with limited disruption to its crucial manufacturing sector. However since late April, it has seen record cases on many days this month, most of those in the commercial hub Ho Chi Minh City and its neighbouring industrial provinces of Dong Nai and Binh Duong. 
The country has recorded 38,200 infections and 138 deaths overall, a vast majority of those since May. 
Almost all of Nike's footwear is manufactured outside the United States. The company has said contract factories in Vietnam produced about 50% of total Nike brand footwear in fiscal 2020, but did not specify the volumes that came from Changshin or Pou Chen.
The latest resurgence in virus cases could signal another hiccup for the world's largest sportswear chain in 2021, after container shortages and U.S. port congestion held up Nike's inventory earlier in the year. 
""Having the factories shut for one or two weeks for Nike is going to cause a massive problem for its supply chain,"" China Market Research Group analyst Shaun Rein said, adding the shutdown would lead to price hikes.

Nike also saw its China sales take a hit after calls to boycott global brands for their comments around forced labor in Xinjiang.

Total preliminary gold production fell to 1.04 million ounces in the three months ended June 30, from 1.10 million ounces in the first quarter, the company said.
Analysts on average had expected production of 1.15 million ounces, according to Refinitiv IBES.
The Canadian miner projected second quarter all-in sustaining costs per ounce, a key industry metric, to be 6% to 8% higher than in the prior quarter.
The world's second largest gold miner by reserves, which hopes the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea could restart this year after reaching an agreement with the government in April, said it remains on track to achieve its 2021 forecast.
Copper production rose 3.2% to 96 million pounds from the prior quarter, the company said.
Barrick said all-in sustaining costs per pound are expected to be 20% to 22% higher than prior quarter, largely due to lower sales at Lumwana mine in Zambia and maintenance at Zaldivar mine in Chile.

The company reiterated that its gold and copper production in the second half of 2021 is expected to be higher than the first half.

Magnit agreed in May to pay 92.4 billion roubles ($1.25 billion) to add Dixy's 2,651 stores and five distribution centres in Moscow, St Petersburg and other regions to its portfolio and has said it still has room to make other acquisitions.
But on Thursday Magnit said the total number of outlets included in the deal would be around 2,500, in order for the company to comply with a 25% market share limit in certain locations.
None of the 142 stores excluded from the deal are in the key markets of Moscow or St Petersburg, keeping the strategic rationale of the acquisition unchanged, Magnit said. 
The Federal Antimonopoly Service also stipulated that Magnit would have to reduce market share in 22 municipalities to 35% until July 1, 2021, which Magnit said could mean a limited number of store closures in those areas. 

""The company doesn't expect any significant changes to its market positions and financial performance in 2021 or going forward as well as its store opening guidance,"" Magnit said.

Investing.com – UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock was down 0.3% in premarket Thursday, giving up earlier gains of more than 1%, after the U.S.'s largest hospital operator confirmed a slump in profit in the second quarter.
Earnings per share fell to $4.70 from $7.12 a year earlier, when the cancellation of non-emergency surgeries due to Covid-19 kept its medical expenses exceptionally low. 
The number was still ahead of expectations and the company raised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $18.30-$18.80 per share. Revenue grew nearly 15% to $71.3 billion, some 4% ahead of forecasts. UnitedHealth expects revenue to stay buoyant as it works through the backlog of postponed procedures.
The company said COVID-19 effects where its services are needed include testing and treatment costs; the residual impact of people having deferred care in 2020; and unemployment and other economy-driven factors. 
The U.S. has vaccinated more than half its population with at least one dose of the vaccine but hesitancy among those not vaccinated and the rapid spread of Delta variant of the virus are now slowing the progress made earlier.

MAG, which is the parent of national carrier Malaysia Airlines and underwent a restructuring earlier this year, invited interested buyers to send in proposals by noon of Aug. 12.
Group Chief Executive Officer Captain Izham Ismail said in May MAG was looking to dispose of its A380 fleet, following completion of its debt restructuring.

He said at the time the group was convinced that the fleet did not fit its future plans, as it ""restrategised to position its business as a global travel group"".
Thai Airways, which is undergoing a court approved restructuring, has also been looking to sell the same aircraft in its fleet.

727,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Mixed; Jobless Claims, Morgan Stanley Earnings Due","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday, ahead of more testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, key unemployment data as well as more earnings, including from banking giant  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 170 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 24 points, or 0.2%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell returns to Capitol Hill later Thursday for the second day of his semi-annual testimony, this time to the Senate Banking Committee.
It’s unlikely that he'll stray too far from the substance of his comments the previous day, when he stated that the scaling back of the central bank’s aggressive monetary support was still “a ways off.”
His dovish stance could well be influenced by the apparent slowdown in the Chinese economy, which emerged from the pandemic-induced lockdown sooner than the American equivalent.
Also of interest will be the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, the most current gauge of the state of the U.S. labor market. This is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and is expected to show a slowly recovering market, with claims expected to fall to 360,000 last week, a drop from 373,000 the previous week.
Also due for release, 45 minutes later, will be the June industrial production number, which is expected to increase 0.6% from May, while June manufacturing production is expected to edge up 0.2% for the previous month.
In the corporate sector, Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report its second-quarter earnings before the open Thursday. The lenders have generally reported a jump in profits, but not enough to seriously impress investors. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has already reported, showing aa 36% drop in profit as medical costs normalized. The company nonetheless raised its guidance for the full year.
Also in the spotlight will be Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) after it poached Mike Verdu from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to act as vice president of game development, leading to speculation the tech giant may add video games to its streaming platform.
Crude oil prices weakened Thursday, weighed by an unexpected rise in U.S. gasoline stocks, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $71.81 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.6% at $73.59 a barrel.
Adding to the pressure were reports that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were close to resolving the standoff that has prevented a group of top producers, known as OPEC+, from increasing much needed supply to the global market. 
Additionally, gold futures were flat at $1,825/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1820.

Investing.com – Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) stock plunged 14% Thursday in Madrid as the company lowered its guidance for the ongoing fiscal year.
The world's biggest maker of offshore wind turbines blamed a sharp increase in raw material prices and higher estimates of ramp-up costs for the more efficient turbines under its 5.X platform, especially in Brazil.
“The impact of these elements has been exacerbated by the pandemic, especially in countries like Brazil where we face supply chain shortfalls and execution-related bottlenecks,” the company said in a note.
The company now expects group revenue for fiscal 2021 at the lower end of the 10.2 billion euro-10.5 billion euro ($12.0 billion-$12.4 billion) range it had given on April 30 when it declared its second-quarter earnings.
The company also said it expects its operating margin before interest and taxes to be between 0% and -1% this fiscal year, from an earlier estimate of 3%-5%.
The company pegged the preliminary numbers for its third quarter revenue at 2.7 billion euro. The final numbers will be released on July 30, the note said."

LONDON (Reuters) -Investing in ""blank cheque"" or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) may not be appropriate for everyone, and additional action may be needed to preserve investor protection, the European Union's markets watchdog said on Thursday.
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds via a listing to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public.
More than 400 SPACs have been listed globally so far this year, with Wall Street dominating as Europe plays catch up.
But the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said SPACs ""may not be appropriate for all investors"" due to risks from dilution, conflicts of interests and uncertainty as to the identification and evaluation of the target company.
It set out how SPACs should tell investors about risks, business strategy and criteria for selecting a target company, with the extent of dilution, such as from payment of fees in shares, illustrated by using tables or diagrams.
""This description shall take into account the issuer’s future challenges and prospects,"" ESMA said.
Amsterdam has been attracting SPAC listings, prompting Britain to ease its own listing rules to avoid being left behind.

""There has been a significant rise in SPAC activity in EU capital markets this year, and with this comes growing interest from investors,"" ESMA's interim chair Anneli Tuominen said in a statement.
""Therefore, it is essential that investors are provided with the information necessary to understand the structure of SPAC transactions before making any investment decisions.""

The group, which listed in May with a 5 billion euro ($5.92 billion) valuation, owns British discount retailer Poundland as well as the PEPCO and Dealz brands in Europe. 
It trades from almost 3,400 stores across 16 countries and is led by CEO Andy Bond, former boss of British supermarket group Asda.
""I think in the medium term one of our key management concerns that we will need to manage well is supply chain inflation and disruption. That will impact more next financial year,"" Bond told Reuters. 
""...Increasing prices would be the last resort and there are lots of things we can do to mitigate: our cost base, working with suppliers,"" he added.
Bond said the company is well placed to manage inflationary pressure and that it could help Pepco, as customers seek out shops offering lower prices. 
Pepco posted third-quarter revenue of 1.04 billion euros and like-for-like sales growth of 29.3%, reflecting the heavy impact of the pandemic a year earlier including shops closures.
""We will deliver top and bottom line, as we promised, but one should not expect that level of like-for-like in the last quarter, because that level of like-for-like is clearly against last year when our stores were closed,"" Bond said. 
""By contrast last year in the summer all our stores were open and there was some pent-up demand so like-for-like in the fourth quarter will be more muted,"" he added.

He said he did not expect a slowdown in the summer or store closures again.

LONDON (Reuters) -Online fashion retailer ASOS (LON:ASOS) warned on Thursday that recent sales growth had slowed as uncertainty over the direction of COVID-19 and poor weather, particularly in Britain, dented market demand, sending its shares sharply lower.
Shares in ASOS, which sells fashion aimed at 20-somethings, were down 14.1% at 0926 GMT, after the group said sales rose 21% in the four months to June 30 but were ""more muted"" in the latter three weeks of the period.
""Uncertainty, particularly around changes to travel rules and hence the ability of people to book holidays, means that customers are finding it difficult to plan their lives and wardrobe choices,"" CEO Nick Beighton told reporters.
He said an unseasonal summer so far, especially in the UK, had also led to unexpected swings in demand.
""One week we saw searches for coats up 77% and the following week searches for evening dresses more than doubled,"" he said.
ASOS anticipated trading volatility would continue in the near term, given the rapidly evolving COVID situation worldwide.
As a result, it forecast its underlying growth rate for the balance of its 2020-21 year to be broadly in line with the prior year period. It still forecast overall full year adjusted pretax profit in line with its expectations.
ASOS has traded through multiple coronavirus lockdowns while store-based rivals have had to close shops.
HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS
Total revenue was 1.29 billion pounds ($1.79 billion) in the four months to June 30, up from 1.1 billion pounds in the same period last year, as its active customer base increased by 1.2 million to 26.1 million.
But gross margin fell 150 basis points reflecting unfavourable foreign exchange movements, higher freight costs due to global supply chain disruption and a category product mix still weighted to lockdown leisurewear.
It noted that product mix, and higher returns rates, had started to reflect a shift back into occasion wear in recent weeks as COVID restrictions eased.
It said the global supply chain pressures were being driven by global freight capacity shortages and delivery delays coming out of key areas of supply.
Prior to Thursday's update analysts' average forecast for full year 2020-21 adjusted pretax profit was 198 million pounds, up from 142.1 million pounds in 2019-20.
ASOS bought the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands in February from the administrators of Philip Green's collapsed Arcadia group for 265 million pounds.

SEOUL (Reuters) -SoftBank's Vision Fund has invested $1.7 billion in Yanolja, the South Korean travel and leisure firm said on Thursday, as it seeks to build on rapid pandemic-induced growth in Southeast Asia, India and Africa.
Yanolja, which provides cloud-based booking and other systems for hotels and travel companies, says demand for its systems has jumped as the spread of COVID-19 put companies under intense pressure to introduce contactless services and cut costs. 
That in turn has made Yanolja a rare beast in the travel industry over the past year - a company which has seen earnings spike.
""Powered by AI, we believe Yanolja is a leader in transforming the travel and leisure industry in South Korea,"" said Greg Moon, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. 
Yanolja declined to comment on the stake Vision Fund is receiving or its valuation based on the investment. But the deal is expected to represent a large increase over its previous valuation of more than $1 billion in 2019 when Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and U.S. firm Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) invested $180 million.
Founded as an online booking agency in 2005, Yanolja only launched its cloud business in 2019. 
The business, which competes with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) in a highly fragmented sector, now has some 30,000 licensees and that client base should reach 500,000 by 2025, Chief Executive Kim Jong-yoon told Reuters in an interview.
""Our sales and profits are bound to improve when COVID-19 travel constraints end,"" he said.
Last year Yanolja swung to a 16.1 billion won ($14 million) operating profit from a loss of 6.2 billion won, while revenue soared 44% to 192 billion won.
Yanolja has previously said it was pursuing an IPO but Kim declined to comment on those plans.
The company's systems allow hotels to manage bookings, accept contactless check-ins, and track when guests are not in their rooms so that electricity is not wasted and rooms can be cleaned more efficiently. 
It also offers systems that allow hotels and travel agencies to connect their data more easily.
In addition to some 9,000 hotels as clients in South Korea, Yanolja has signed up some 6,000 hotels in Southeast Asia where it has a presence in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
It also plans to enter Vietnam shortly having partnered with VNTravel, the online travel unit of VNLIFE.

In India, Yanolja has some 6,000 hotel customers, while in Africa at least 3,000 hotels are using its services after it entered the market in September last year.

The agreement on a 7.41 billion ringgit ($1.77 billion)acquisition for 60% equity in the Bandar Malaysia mixed commercial project by IWH and its partner China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) lapsed on May 6 after a failure to meet conditions, the statement issued on Wednesday said.
Bandar Malaysia was due to house the terminal for the now-scrapped high-speed rail link between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. The project, owned by TRX City, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance, was initially announced in 2011, cancelled in 2017 and reinstated in April, 2019.
The statement said parties had been working to find solutions to preserve the partnership.
""Despite such efforts, to-date, the parties have not been able to mutually agree to the terms of the extension,"" it said.
IWH-CREC, the developer in the joint venture, had paid a 1.24 billion ringgit deposit and advance to the government last year to allow them to start work on Bandar Malaysia.
That go-ahead prompted IWH to plan for a listing in the first half of 2021 to raise at least 5 billion ringgit.
TRX City said it remained committed to the project, and that ""any future business and commercialization plans will take into account market conditions and the national socio-economic agenda"".
China Railway Group will continue to work closely with TRX City in any future co-operation in the country, the statement said.

The Bandar Malaysia project was originally a deal struck by former Prime Minister Najib Razak to ease the debt burden of scandal-plagued state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), but collapsed in May 2017 over payment disputes.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning with investors digesting mixed Chinese economic data alongside U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony that economic recovery from COVID-19 is “still a ways off” from the levels needed to begin asset tapering.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.10% by 10:10 PM ET (2:10 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.03%. Data released earlier in the day said China’s second-quarter GDP grew 7.9% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter. It also said industrial production grew 8.3% year-on-year in June and that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5%.
The data comes as the debate on whether COVID-19 recovery in the world’s second-largest economy is peaking. The upcoming maturity of policy loans could indicate the extent to which the People’s Bank of China will further loosen monetary policy.
Meanwhile, Sino-U.S. tensions continue to simmer as the U.S. said it does not plan to revive a regular economic dialogue with China that was suspended under the previous Donald Trump administration. The U.S. Senate also passed a bill to ban all products from China’s Xinjiang province.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.66%. The city will now allow vaccinated residents and workers to return from nations it has deemed extremely high-risk, including the U.K., Brazil, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa and Nepal. Unvaccinated students can also return home from the U.K. under the relaxation.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.26% with the Bank of Korea keeping its interest rate unchanged at 0.5% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. June trade data that was also released earlier in the day said exports grew 39.8% year-on-year, imports grew 40.7% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at KRW4.45 billion ($3.87 million).
On the COVID-19 front, the country broke yet another record as 1,600 daily cases were reported as of Jul. 15.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.85%, ahead of the Bank of Japan policy decision to be handed down on Friday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.03% over lower-than-expected labor data for June released earlier in the day. The employment change was a lower-than-expected 29,100 and the full employment change was 51,600 while the unemployment rate was a better-than-expected 4.9%.
Powell gave reassurances in his testimony before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday that monetary policy would remain accommodative and that inflationary pressures will likely moderate. However, he reiterated that the central bank was prepared to act if inflation was persistently and materially above its 2% target.
Investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of Powell’s second round of testimony later in the day.
“Powell provided a more dovish than anticipated testimony to Congress... we continue to expect the Fed will announce its intention to begin tapering its asset purchases in the September meeting and start tapering in October,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kim Mundy said in a note."

Exxon said it took the decision to hire the new workers after four meetings with the United Steelworkers (USW) union local 13-243 failed to yield the results the company expected.
""It is also worth clarifying that our USW represented employees remain employed by the company while locked-out and we look forward to welcoming them back when there is a ratified contract,"" Exxon said in a statement posted to its website.
Hoot Landry, USW International staff representative, said Exxon's hiring another group of temporary workers was meant to frighten the locked-out employees.
""That's what they do to intimidate our members,"" Landry said. 
Exxon said in its statement the refinery is being run by superviors while the temporary workers, called contractor operators, ""will help us to maintain headcount.""

Exxon locked out the union-represented workers at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant on May 1 to avoid a strike as a 75-day labor peace period came to an end following the expiration of the contract. 
The USW has said the company's last proposal, made in April, requires its members to give up long-standing seniority and would create a separate contract for workers in the lube oil plant from that for workers in the refinery. Exxon has said the proposal would give it flexibility to be profitable in low-margin environments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as investors poured more money into the company's funds, driving robust fee growth and boosting its assets under management to a record high.
BlackRock's assets under management jumped to a record $9.49 trillion in the second quarter from $7.32 trillion a year earlier.
""More than ever, our voice is resonating deeper and more broadly with our clients worldwide,"" BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, said in an interview.
The company continued to gather assets at a robust pace as investors deployed money across BlackRock's product types and asset classes.
Global equity markets' strength during the second quarter helped boost both assets under management as well as fee growth.
The U.S. economy displayed signs of a recovery over the past quarter, helped by large government stimulus and steady vaccination programs. Global financial markets continue to display strength a year after the coronavirus pandemic crashed asset prices and hurt risk sentiment.
""It seems like everything is going their way right now. It's just strength across the entire platform,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
(Graphic: GRAPHIC: BlackRock's vs peers in Q2: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnyredpl/Pasted%20image%201626279409075.png)
Despite the better-than-expected results, BlackRock shares fell 3.3% to $877.98, a near 1-week low.
Investors may have been disappointed in net inflows coming in at $81 billion, down from $172 billion in the prior quarter, a drop associated with the loss of a $58 billion equity index mandate from a U.S. pension fund client, analysts said.
""People are also focused on where the growth is coming, and the growth is coming in the ETF business, which tends to generate a lower revenue base than the traditional long only asset management business,"" said CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert.
A combination of these factors may have spooked investors, Seifert, who still likes the stock and would treat Wednesday's weakness as a buying opportunity, said.
BlackRock remains well placed to be a leader in the asset management industry, analysts said.
""Despite them having $9.5 trillion and being so big, they are still best positioned to deliver the best growth over the next couple of years, relative to their peers,"" Sanders said.
The company's adjusted net income rose to $1.55 billion, or $10.03 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $1.21 billion, or $7.85 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $9.46 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Revenue rose 32% to $4.82 billion, helped by higher performance fees and 14% growth in revenue from technology services. 
BlackRock's shares rose 16% during the quarter ended June 30, compared with a 15% gain for a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","Toyota buys U.S. mapping, road data firm to bulk up driverless tech","By Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's research arm said on Thursday it acquired U.S.-based Carmera, a provider of maps and data for driverless vehicles, marking the Japanese car maker's latest investment in autonomous technology.
The purchase, through newly created subsidiary Woven Planet for an undisclosed sum, underscores Toyota's push to bulk up its self-driving arsenal as traditional automakers compete with the autonomous ambitions of tech giants including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Buying Carmera will give Toyota access to real-time, high-definition maps and crowdsourced inputs that are essential for autonomous vehicles to locate and navigate themselves, the companies said in a statement.
The two companies have collaborated since 2018 on projects including technology that updates repainted lane markings on high-definition maps with accuracy.
""It's very well aligned with our expansion globally as a company,"" Woven Planet chief executive James Kuffner told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. 
Woven Planet was established in January to invest in and develop mobility with artificial intelligence. It is building a prototype ""city of the future"" called Woven City at the base of Mount Fuji, powered by hydrogen fuel cells that would be a laboratory for autonomous cars. 
With the acquisition, Kuffner said Woven Planet would look to develop and sell an open map platform to original equipment manufacturers and automakers who wanted accurate and fresh data.
""With Carmera, we're just accelerating. We'll continue to accelerate ... and look for strategic partnerships or acquisitions,"" Kuffner said, adding he wanted to ""double or quadruple"" the size of Woven Planet in the next couple of years via organic growth and acquisitions.
Earlier this year, Toyota bought ride-hailing service  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s self-driving technology unit for $550 million, and invested in Ridecell that provides automation for fleet businesses.
The Japanese firm has other self-driving partnerships, including a joint venture with SoftBank Corp, stakes in China's Didi Global Inc and Singapore's Grab, and is forming a consortium with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), suppliers and chipmakers. 
Moving into new and non-traditional car making such as driverless and electric technology, Toyota has increasingly married its storied manufacturing process with more recent acquisitions of startups and Silicon Valley know-how to develop the next generation of cars.
""There's so much uncertainty in the automotive space right now,"" said Kuffner.
""But the only thing that I am sure of is that it will look very different in 10 or 30 years. The only thing we can do is to try to create the future by investment ... take the profits from Toyota's existing business and invest it in the future, to create the future of the Toyota Group.""

Most automakers including Toyota offer Level 2 automation where the car steers and accelerates but the driver must be ready to take the wheel, and experts say fully self-driven cars are years away. 
Still, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk promised earlier this month that a beta version of its technology that supports fully autonomous driving with no driver intervention will be available in ""a month or so"". Toyota rival GM showed off a fully autonomous all-electric flying Cadillac concept vehicle earlier this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Wednesday urged about 50,000 owners of General Motors (NYSE:GM) electric Chevrolet Bolt vehicles that were recalled last year to park outside and away from homes and other structures after charging because of fire risks.
Earlier on Wednesday, GM made the same recommendation and added owners should not leave vehicles charging overnight. The recommendation was prompted after the largest U.S. automaker said it was investigating reports of two recent fires in vehicles that were recalled in November for fire risks.
The 50,000 U.S. Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles (EVs) are from the 2017-2019 model years and were recalled for the potential of an unattended fire in the high-voltage battery pack underneath the backseat’s bottom cushion. 
NHTSA opened an investigation in October into the Bolt fires, the agency noted Wednesday and ""continues to evaluate the information received, and is looking into these latest fires.""
The November recall of nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt EVs -- including about 50,000 in the United States -- with high voltage batteries produced at LG Chem Ltd's Ochang, South Korea facility, was made after five reported fires and two minor injuries.
In April, GM also announced a software update and said dealers would use ""diagnostic tools to identify potential battery anomalies and replace battery module assemblies as necessary.""
NHTSA said owners should park outside indefinitely regardless of whether they have had the software update completed.

GM said in April it would make the diagnostic software standard in the 2022 Bolt EV and electric utility vehicles, as well as future GM electric vehicles, and would offer the update for all other Bolt EVs on the road at a future date.

The country's top independent gas producer also said it has begun the sell-down process of up to 49% of Train 2 in the Pluto LNG plant, and was looking to cut its stake in Scarborough, Woodside's only big growth project in the near term.
Woodside said it continues to review the escalating costs of the Scarborough and Pluto expansion project, which were previously pegged at $11.4 billion. A final investment decision for those projects is slated for later this year.
The average realised price that Woodside got for its products was $46 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in the June quarter, up $2 from the first three months of the year, and higher than $28 last year.
Realised oil prices shot up to $75 per boe, more than double the $31 last year.

The recovery helped sales revenue hit $1.29 billion in the three months to June 30, up from $768 million a year ago.
However, output was hit by bad weather and maintenance activity. The company produced 22.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) in the quarter, slightly lower than the 25.9 mmboe a year ago.

U.S. monetary policy will offer ""powerful support"" to the economy ""until the recovery is complete,"" Powell told a congressional hearing in remarks that portrayed a recent jump in inflation as temporary and focused on the need for continued job growth.
Powell's comments followed data this week showing U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in June and U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years.
Investors in recent weeks have focused on inflation, with many fearing a possible hawkish shift by the Federal Reserve, as well as a spike in coronavirus infections that could knock U.S. equities off record highs.
With banks kicking off second-quarter earnings season this week, analysts expect 66% growth in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES estimate data from Refinitiv.
The S&P 500 is up about 16% so far this year, leading many investors to worry that the stock market rally may run out of steam, and they are looking to earnings to potentially provide more fuel.
""Everyone knows earnings are going to be very strong. The question is how the market reacts to those earnings, and what are the outlooks given by management. That is more critical than anything,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

AIG (NYSE:AIG) and Blackstone said on Wednesday the private equity firm would pay $2.2 billion in cash for 9.9% of the unit, sending the insurer's shares more than 6% higher in after-market trading.
AIG had been fielding inquiries from potential investors about taking a 19.9% stake in the life and retirement unit, which sells insurance and annuities, but Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino in May said the company would use an IPO to sell the stake instead, dashing the hopes of bidders.
""This does not derail the IPO plan,"" the source said.
The moves are part of AIG's effort to split its life insurance and retirement businesses off from its property and casualty operations, which was announced in 2020, years after activist investors targeted AIG for a break-up.
""(The deal) provides AIG with flexibility as we continue to work to separate Life & Retirement from AIG, and results in significant new capital for AIG to deploy to support our capital management priorities,"" Zaffino said in a statement on Wednesday.
Blackstone will also enter a long-term asset management relationship with AIG to manage $50 billion, or about 25%, of life and retirement's investment portfolio. That amount is due to increase to $92.5 billion over the next six years.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>",Factbox-Five facts on why electric buses are key to Biden's green agenda,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - President Joe Biden has vowed to significantly reduce emissions by 2030, while at the same time creating new, well-paid green energy jobs. His administration has identified bus electrification as one of the main ways to achieve that goal.
While more than half of transport emissions are produced by conventional passenger cars, diesel-powered transit buses are considered among the worst polluters, particularly in America's cities.
MASS TRANSIT POLLUTION
Converting transit buses to battery or fuel-cell power is considered one of the fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which at 29% accounts for the largest share of U.S. emissions. 
LOSING THE ELECTRIC BUS RACE
Of the United State's roughly 70,000 largely diesel transit buses, only around 2% are currently zero emission, according to the Center for Transportation and Environment, which advises transit agencies on clean energy buses. 
That puts the United States far behind China, which has converted nearly 60% of its bus fleet, according to Chinese government data for 2020. In Europe, electric buses made up 6% of total new bus registrations in 2020, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
WHO FUNDS U.S. ELECTRIC BUSES?
U.S. transit agencies receive a large part of funding from the Federal Transit Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that has provided nearly $670 million in e-bus grants over the last eight years.
Thanks in part to that funding, the U.S. e-bus market is expected to balloon five-fold to $2.7 billion by 2024, according to analysts at P&S Intelligence.
WHO ARE THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS?
The U.S. electric bus market is currently led by two players selling purpose-built battery-powered buses: California-based Proterra Inc and BYD North America, a unit of China-based BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd. Each company has sold around 1,000 e-buses in the U.S. over the past ten years.
But electric models of incumbent diesel bus makers, including U.S.-based GILLIG, Canadian NFI Group Inc's New Flyer unit, and Canada-based Novabus, a Volvo subsidiary, are gaining in popularity among transit officials.
New Flyer, GILLIG, Novabus, BYD and Proterra jointly have capacity to produce around 6,000 electric and conventional buses per year, with BYD making up around a fourth of overall production capacity. 
WHAT IS BIDEN'S GOAL?
Biden aims to electrify 50,000 diesel buses, or roughly 70% of the U.S. fleet over the next eight years. 

Under a bipartisan agreement struck last month, $7.5 billion would flow to bus electrification programs, although that funding also includes electric school buses.
Biden wants to see that pot of money spur creation of well-paying union jobs.

Siemens Energy, which owns 67% of Siemens Gamesa, said it would not reach the low end of its forecast for a margin on adjusted earnings before, interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) before special items of 3%-5% in the year ending September.
The company, which was spun off from former parent Siemens last year, kept its sales outlook and still expects revenues to grow 3%-8%. However, it warned that third quarter results, scheduled for Aug. 4, were unlikely to meet market expectations.
Earlier, Siemens Gamesa, the world's largest maker of offshore wind turbines, toned down sales expectations and warned of a possible loss in the current fiscal year, blaming a sharp increase in raw material prices.

In its second profit warning in less than three months, Siemens Gamesa also cited higher than expected ramp-up costs for its 5.X onshore wind turbine platform, especially in Brazil.
Siemens Energy confirmed the outlook for its Gas and Power division, saying it still expected sales to rise by 2%-6% and an adjusted EBITA margin before special items of 3.5%-5.5%.

Given rising consumer spending, several retail stocks have gained momentum of late. This is evident in the S&P Retail Select Index’s 120.2% and 50% gains over the past year and year-to-date, respectively, versus the broader S&P 500 index’s 36.6% and 16.3% returns.
 Signet Jewelers Limited  (SIG) and  Zumiez Inc . (ZUMZ) are currently trading above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Given the favorable backdrop, we expect these two stocks to maintain their momentum in the near term.

Jamieson will join the governance and risk committees as part of her duties, effective Aug. 1, RBC said.
Indspire is a national indigenous registered charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people across Canada.
Jamieson is also on the board of Deloitte Canada and is co-chair of the Indigenous Advisory Council of the Canadian National Railway Co.

The move comes at a time when diversity, particularly in the executive and board ranks, has come under increased scrutiny.
Last month, TD Bank Group named Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed chief executive of its securities unit and head of wholesale banking, making it one of Canada's six biggest lenders to have a non-Caucasian at its helm.

(Reuters) -Shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) fell sharply on Wednesday and were both trading below half their recent peak prices, testing the fortitude of the stocks' retail shareholders.
AMC, in its fourth straight day of losses, closed down 15% at $33.43, close to 54% below its all-time high of $72.62 reached in early June. The stock earlier fell as low as $33.25 to its lowest point since June 1. 
GameStop finished down 6.9% at $167.62 after hitting a session low of $165.07, compared with its June 8 high of $344.66. GameStop, which hit a record high of $483 in late January, also registered a fourth straight day of declines. 
The companies have been at the center of epic rallies in so-called meme stocks that have captivated Wall Street, hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors. Both are still sitting on big year-to-date gains. AMC was still up 1,476% so far in 2021 while GameStop was up 789% for the year to date.
Their recent declines may test the individual investors that have purchased their shares in recent months, often touting their buys on sites such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets.
""When things are going up it's easy to get on board,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. ""It could go significantly lower because there's less interest in the trade. People hate to lose money much more than they love to make money.""
The decline in AMC shares came even after a strong weekend at the box office, when Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Marvel's superhero adventure movie ""Black Widow"" captured $80 million in the biggest opening weekend for a movie since the pandemic. 
Dollarhide noted that Disney also generated $60 million globally from selling the movie on its direct-to-consumer streaming service, which competes with movie theaters.
The COVID-19 pandemic kept theaters and other businesses shuttered for months. Concerns about the surge in cases of the latest COVID-19 variant may be exacerbating declines in so-called reopening stocks such as AMC, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler.
""It's a stock that was trading up very high because it was a momentum trade and when the momentum dries up a little bit it comes down,"" Handler said. 

For the full year 2021, AMC is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $3.16 on revenue of $2.41 billion. For its fiscal year ending in January 2022, GameStop is expected to report a loss per share of $0.56 on revenue of $5.57 billion. Estimates for both companies were collected by Refinitiv. As of Tuesday's close, about 78 million shares of AMC, or almost 16% of its float, were sold short, according to the latest estimate from S3 Partners. That compares with 75 million shares sold short as of June 30. 
About 8.68 million shares in GameStop, or 14.9% of its float, was sold short as of Tuesday's close, compared with 8.22 million on June 30, according to S3.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Wednesday pressed a New York judge to dismiss a lawsuit by state Attorney General Letitia James claiming the online retailer failed to ensure worker safety at two New York City warehouses as COVID-19 infections surged.
James sued Amazon in February over its safety protocols for thousands of workers at a Staten Island fulfillment center and a Queens distribution center, and for allegedly retaliating against two employees who protested against the conditions.
But at a hearing, a lawyer for Seattle-based Amazon said the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration had the expertise and authority to oversee workplace safety at private employers, preempting James' state law claims.
""The court should defer to that agency, rather than wade into that quagmire,"" the lawyer Jason Schwartz told Justice Nancy Bannon of the Manhattan Supreme Court.
Schwartz added that Amazon had cause to discipline the protesters Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer, saying they ignored social distancing rules, while Smalls violated a paid quarantine to lead a March 2020 protest.
Smalls was fired, and Palmer received a written warning.
In response, Karen Cacace, the labor bureau chief in James' office, said Amazon ""put profits as their primary goal,"" and needed a court-appointed safety monitor.
She also noted that COVID-19 cases are rising as the more contagious Delta variant spreads, including a ""serious uptick"" in Staten Island.
""This is not a problem that has disappeared,"" Cacace said.
Schwartz countered that a monitor was no longer necessary after Governor Andrew Cuomo ended the state's COVID-19 emergency.
Bannon admonished both sides she will not let the daily headlines govern her ruling.
""I don't hear anyone saying the whole pandemic is over,"" Bannon said. ""The news is not great this week about that. Tune in next week and it might be something different.""

Amazon has separately asked a federal judge in Brooklyn for an injunction to stop James from suing.
In a July 9 filing there, James said Amazon had not shown irreparable harm.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eked out a small gain Wednesday as an Apple-led rally in tech was kept in check by losses in energy and financial stocks as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell backed the Fed's accommodative monetary policy stance.   
S&P 500 added 0.12%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.13%, or 44 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.22%.
Powell didn't deviate from his recent remarks before Congress on Wednesday, as the Fed chair continued to view the factors pushing up inflation as temporary, and reiterated the central bank's commitment to keep the easy monetary policy measures in place to support job gains.  There is still long a way to achieve ""substantial further progress"" on maximum unemployment, Powell said in prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee.
The remarks arrive against further signs that price pressures are building as producer inflation surprised to the upside.
Producer Price Index rose 1.0% on the month, above economists expectations of 0.5%.  
The inflation numbers “have been higher than expected and hoped for, but they're actually still consistent with what we've been talking about,” Powell said in his semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. “[I]t's just the perfect storm of high demand and low supply, and it should pass.”
The somewhat dovish remarks kept U.S. bond yields low, exacerbating concerns that banks will struggle to generate meaningful returns on their loan products in a low-rate environment.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) reported quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) missed on the bottom line, sending its share price down 3%.
Energy, however, led the decliners  as oil prices fell sharply amid ongoing struggles between OPEC and its allies to reach a consensus on production levels.
UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said Wednesday that an agreement had not been reached yet with OPEC+ on an extension of an oil supply deal. The news cooled earlier reports that the major oil producing nations were inching closer to a deal, and overshadowed positive data showing weekly U.S. crude supplies fell by 7.9 barrels last week.
Tech, however, supported the broader market, led by rally in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on a Bloomberg reports that the tech giant is ramping its iPhone production by 20% amid expectations for a jump in demand.
Other large cap tech stocks including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT were also in the green. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended lower.
In political news, General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 1% after warning owners of the 2017-2019 Bolt electric vehicle not to park their autos inside or charge them unattended overnight after two of the vehicles caught fire.    "

The euro was up 0.5% at $1.1836, while the yen traded down 0.6% at $109.9600.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos may have been beaten to space by rival Richard Branson, but the billionaire American businessman is poised to make history next week aboard what would be the world's first unpiloted suborbital flight with an all-civilian crew.
Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is due to be part of a four-person crew for a planned 11-minute ride to the edge of space on Tuesday inside his company Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, another milestone in the nascent and potentially lucrative space tourism sector.
He is set to be joined by his brother and private equity executive Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian woman aviator Wally Funk and an as-yet-unidentified person who paid $28 million for a spot aboard the spacecraft, scheduled to launch from a West Texas site. 
New Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. The crew is set to include only civilians and none of Blue Origin's employees or staff astronauts, three people familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. 
Blue Origin's astronauts include NASA space shuttle veteran Nicholas Patrick.
""To see the Earth from space, it changes you, it changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity,"" Bezos said in a video last month discussing the flight.
There has never before been a fully autonomous suborbital or orbital flight with an all-civilian crew, Teal Group space industry analyst Marco Caceres said.
Branson, the British billionaire businessman, was aboard his company Virgin Galactic's rocket plane for its pioneering suborbital flight from New Mexico on Sunday. The Virgin Galactic flight included two pilots, as well as the company's chief astronaut instructor and its lead operations engineer.
New Shepard lifts off from a standing position on a launch pad, like traditional rocket launches. With Virgin Galactic, a rocket-powered spaceplane was dropped from a carrier plane in mid-air.
New Shepard, like Virgin Galactic's flight, will not enter into orbit around Earth, but will take the passengers some 62 miles up (100 km) before the capsule returns by parachute. Virgin Galactic's flight reached 53 miles (86 km) above Earth.
Billionaire businessman Elon Musk's space transportation company SpaceX is planning an even-more-ambitious mission in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule.
'SIMPLE MATH'
Blue Origin's flight is two decades in the making. Bezos founded the company in 2000. A pilotless craft was a financial strategy adopted by Blue Origin executives years ago. 
""It's simple math,"" said one of the people familiar with the company's thinking. ""If you design a system so that you don't need a pilot or a co-pilot you can have more paying customers.""
New Shepard can accommodate six people. Blue Origin and industry insiders had previously discussed company employees going up on the first flight. 
A Blue Origin spokesperson confirmed the decision was made for four seats to offer an enhanced customer experience for the first flight.
The decision to skip over Blue Origin's staff astronauts and technical experts has caused frustration for some company insiders who viewed the first crewed flight as a crucial opportunity to gather data and technical feedback for a program in its infancy, and to evaluate the experience for future paying customers, the sources said.
A seasoned astronaut would provide a calming presence for civilian crew members as New Shepard blasts off at speeds upwards of 2,200 miles (3,540 km) per hour, the sources added. 
The crew members will receive two days of training. Blue Origin has assigned two staff members, on the ground, to help the passengers strap in and to provide point-by-point instructions over headsets during the mission. 
""It's kind of like getting on a ride at an amusement park,"" Caceres said. ""You just trust that everything has been checked out, is in good working order ... and you just sit back and enjoy the ride.""
Some industry sources have expressed concerns that passengers - overwhelmed by the experience or in a state of euphoria - could be rattled by routine noises, miss key instructions, pass out or injure themselves floating around the cabin, potentially dangerous scenarios a trained astronaut could respond to.
Funk, 82, was one of 13 women who passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's 1960s space program but were denied the chance to become astronauts because of their gender. 

Proving the safety of space travel is important to developing what Swiss investment bank UBS estimates will be a $3 billion annual tourism market a decade from now.
""One of the main goals of the New Shepard mission is to demonstrate that going to suborbital space is perfectly safe for the average person,"" Caceres said. ""So there is a benefit to having as many average people on these flights as possible.""

By Arathy S Nair and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -Three top U.S. Democratic senators on Wednesday unveiled a discussion draft of a bill that aims to legalize cannabis, a move that would allow adult Americans to buy and possess up to 10 ounces of marijuana without facing criminal penalties. 
The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act floated by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Finance Chairman Ron Wyden and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, would expunge federal non-violent marijuana crimes, further medical research and allow cannabis companies access to essential financial services.
While adult use of cannabis is legal in 18 states, and allowed medically in 37 states, it remains illegal under U.S. federal law, deterring banks and others from dealing with companies that sell marijuana or related products. 
The draft set the minimum age required to buy cannabis at 21 and limited retail sales transactions at the state level to 10 ounces of cannabis at a time or the equivalent amount of any cannabis derivative.
The draft also states that a new definition of cannabis would be established and proposes moving cannabis oversight to the Food and Drug Administration and regulators that overlook alcohol and tobacco, away from the Drug Enforcement Administration.
States will control the possession, production, or distribution of cannabis, the draft says, while shipping marijuana into states that have not legalized it will be prohibited. However, such states can not stop shipments going to other legalized regions through their borders.
Senator Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said ""This new bill puts the cart before the horse."" He added that marijuana use needs more research. 
A final legislative draft will be introduced later and feedback on the discussion draft can be provided until Sept. 1. 
To become a law, the measure will have to pass both the Democratic-controlled Senate and House of Representatives and be signed by President Joe Biden.
""It is hard to see how this can pass, but nonetheless it is positive to see progress and momentum,"" said Greg Heyman, founder of cannabis investment firm Beehouse Partners. 

A major cannabis banking reform bill that was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in April has failed to make any progress in the Senate.
""Our main concern over this current legislation (Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act) is around the ability to get it passed in the Senate,"" private equity firm Poseidon Managing Director Michael Boniello said, adding it may hinder other federal cannabis reforms, including the banking act, from being passed in 2021.

Investing.com -- After shaking off a higher than expected consumer price index reading for June on Tuesday, stocks continued their upward climb on Wednesday. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell began the first of two days of testimony in Congress on Wednesday as the central bank’s Beige Book, a periodic report on economic observations from its member banks, was released. 
Anecdotally, some businesses are still struggling to fill jobs, the report said, and the gap in supply and demand in the labor market doesn’t seem likely to abate soon. 
Inflation accompanied reopening activity, with pricing pressures growing in the hospitality sector, as the reopening of hotels and restaurants confronted limited supplies of materials and workers.
Big banks continued to report a rebound in earnings, though some of the biggest U.S. lenders, including  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC), reported sluggish loan activity as stimulus-flush households kept borrowing low, at least in the second quarter. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Last of the big bank earnings
After a week of big bank earnings, which mostly showed strong gains over last year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will be the final to report on Thursday. Analysts tracked by investing.com expect it to post earnings per share of $1.66 on revenue of $13.98 billion for the second quarter.
2. More testimony from Fed
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s two-day Congressional testimony will continue Thursday. In prepared remarks for the House Financial Services Committee, Powell told the members Wednesday that the economy needs to improve more before the central bank tightens its ultra-easy monetary policy. He said the Fed would give adequate notice before it begins the pullback.
3. Production data
Production numbers are scheduled for release at 9:15 AM ET (1315 GMT) on Thursday. Industrial production is expected to increase 0.6% for June from May, compared to the 0.8% gain in the prior month period. Manufacturing production is expected to edge up 0.2% for the month of June, compared to 0.9% for May.

767,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",2 Energy Stocks Positioned to Perform Well During the Second Half of 2021,"Energy stocks have attracted significant investor attention this year thanks to a dramatic increase in oil prices. And because the global resumption of economic activities is expected to continue driving the demand for oil in the coming quarters, energy stocks should continue rallying even if the major oil producing countries discontinue their supply cuts. So, we believe energy stocks ARC resources (AETUF) and CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CEIX) are well positioned to deliver solid returns in the second half of the year.After suffering a serious setback last year, energy stocks have witnessed a solid rally this year thanks to a rebound in oil prices. Rising demand from reopening economic activities and prolonged supply cuts by the major oil producing countries have driven a dramatic increase in oil prices this year.
After Energy Information Administration data revealed a substantial decline in crude and gasoline inventories, oil prices rose last week, rebounding from early losses. Along with rising demand from reopening economies, disagreements among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia, and other producers over supply strategy might keep driving oil prices higher in the coming months. According to EIA’s latest short-term energy outlook, global oil consumption is expected to increase by 6% from 2020 levels in 2021 and by an additional 4% in 2022. This should bode well for energy companies.
Given this backdrop, we think energy stocks ARC Resources Ltd. (AETUF) and CONSOL Energy Inc (NYSE:CNX). (CEIX) could be solid bets now because they are poised to cash in on the overall energy sector’s growth.

So, we think it could be wise to bet instead on fundamentally sound software stocks Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). They still have plenty of upside to deliver. Read on to learn more.Despite a not-so-impressive stock market debut last September, the ‘secretive’ data company Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) has attracted investors’ interest by entering several strategic alliances, accepting bitcoin as payment and being popular on social media, such as Reddit. However, the stock has lost 11.7% in price over the past three months and 9% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $22.45.
PLTR’s revenue increased 49% year-over-year to $341 million for its fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2021. However, the company’s net loss increased 127.5% year-over-year to $123.47 million in the quarter. And its loss per share for the quarter came in at $0.07 compared to $0.10 in the year-ago period.
Analysts expect the company’s EPS to decline 66.7% for the quarter ending September 30, 2021, and 30% in its fiscal year 2021. But, despite the company’s unimpressive financials and unfavorable analyst estimates, the stock is currently trading at an expensive valuation. In terms of forward P/CF and P/S, PLTR’s 258.78x and 29.55x, respectively, are higher than the 22.67x and 4.02x industry averages. So, it’s wise to avoid the stock now.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A key EU lawmaker at the European Parliament steering the debate on tough new rules aimed at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other large online platforms, secured backing to beef up Europeans' fundamental rights in the draft rules.
Proposed by the European Commission in December last year, the Digital Services Act (DSA) forces the tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content such as hate speech and child sexual abuse material on their platforms.
However, Greens lawmaker Patrick Breyer, who is responsible for shepherding the DSA through Parliament on behalf of the assembly's civil liberties and justice committee, wants more emphasis on fundamental rights and digital privacy in the rules.
The committee on Wednesday adopted his proposals, which will need to be agreed by two other committees looking into the draft rules. Parliament aims to come up with a common position by the end of this year.
""It is clear that the European Parliament proposal will be much more ambitious than the Commission's proposal, in some aspects it could be groundbreaking,"" Breyer told Reuters in an interview.

His proposals include the right to use and pay for digital services anonymously wherever reasonably feasible, phasing out behavioural and personalised targeting for non-commercial and political advertising and no obligation on platforms to block access to content.
The final parliament proposal will have to be thrashed out with EU countries, with the rules likely to come into force next year.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Wealth manager Americana Partners has made a $25 a share bid for Westwood Holdings Group, offering a nearly 28% premium to take the publicly traded financial advisory and mutual fund firm private, sources familiar with the matter said.
Westwood said in a statement it had reviewed two bids from Americana, including the one for $25 per share, and are rejecting both. The bids are too low and executives are not certain that Americana would be able to finance the transaction, it said.
Houston-based Americana made the all-cash offer for Westwood, which is based in Dallas and has roughly $15 billion in assets under management, last month, the sources said.
News of the unsolicited bid sent Westwood's stock up as much as 19% on Wednesday, leaving it to trade at $23.30 by early afternoon.
A representative for Americana declined to comment.
Including Wednesday's jump, Westwood's stock price has climbed some 63% since January. But Americana believes that Westwood has produced negative returns over three- and five-year periods. Americana also believes Westwood could perform better out of the spotlight of the public markets, the people said.
Americana wants to expand across Texas and sees potential in Westwood's wealth and trust businesses, the sources said.
The bid was made shortly after Westwood's largest investor, James C. Pappas' JCP Investment Management, which owns 10.37% of Westwood, began pushing management and the board more publicly to consider alternatives for the firm, including a sale.
In a regulatory filing in April, Pappas said that he intended to speak with management and the board about strategic options.
A representative for JCP declined to comment.
Westwood chief executive officer Brian Casey said on Wednesday that cost cuts and investments in technology are paying off, however.
""Westwood is now on a more clear path to growth,"" Casey said in the statement. ""We are even more confident in our ability to carry out our current plan."" 
A wave of consolidation has hit the asset management and wealth management industry at a time when low interest rates and investor preferences for inexpensive index funds have made it tougher for stand-alone firms to compete with rivals such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager.
 Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) was acquired by Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) last year and  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) was purchased by financial services company  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) this year. 
Last year was record-setting for wealth sector deals, with more than 200 completed, according to research firm Echelon Partners.

Americana Partners, which has offices in Houston, Dallas and Austin, was formed in 2019 when its principals spun off from Morgan Stanley. 
It has roughly $4.5 billion in assets under management.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc will spend $1 billion on social media creators through the end of 2022 in a fight for top talent announced in a week when TikTok became the first rival mobile app to hit 3 billion global downloads.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s investments will include bonus programs to pay creators who hit certain milestones on its apps, including photo-sharing service Instagram, and fund users to produce content, the company said. 
The social media giant is opening its wallet to woo creators with major fan followings from platforms like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube and short video app TikTok. 
Multiple major tech platforms are on the offensive to attract and keep social media personalities with new payments and services.
TikTok has committed to spending $2 billion to support creators over three years.  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)'s Snapchat used to pay creators a total of $1 million per day to post popular short-form videos on its service and says it still distributes millions per month to support creators through its Spotlight program.
""With the 3 billion install milestone, TikTok is the fifth non-game app to join a tier that's historically been the exclusive domain of Facebook,"" said mobile insights firm Sensor Tower in a Tuesday report.

Facebook said its bonuses so far are by invitation only. On its main platform video creators and online gamers will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones like broadcasting a certain number of hours to earn Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos.
Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.

Already dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, Uchendu received a call at midnight on Sunday that his dealership was engulfed in flames as looting and violence, the worst in South Africa for years, escalated, wrecking hundreds of businesses.
""I'm speechless,"" the 45-year old told Reuters on Wednesday standing next to 58 burnt cars. ""I feel like committing suicide because my livelihood has been taken away from me. I was sitting crying, helpless because I can't do anything.""
Among the severely burnt cars was an unrecognisable second hand Range Rover Evoque worth 220,000 rand ($15,000), which stood alongside low to high-end cars. 
""All these things are gone. I don't even know where to start because how will I start. I still need to pay my rent, I've got three kids I need to take care of, how will I take care of my kids?,"" the visibly emotional Uchendu said. 
Triggered by the jailing of ex-president Jacob Zuma last week after he failed to appear at a corruption inquiry, the unrest has widened into an outpouring of anger over poverty and inequality.
Many of South Africa's small, medium-sized and micro enterprises (SMME) are not insured, compounding any attempts of recovery of those damaged in the unrest.
""We small businesses, nobody wants to insure us here in Jules (street), it's a high risk area. When you call insurance (companies) they say no this is a high risk area,"" he said of his business that employed 16 people.
A survey done by the Small Business Institute (SBI), revealed last year that as many as 55,000 SMMEs may not make it through the COVID-19 pandemic. With the unrest, the number was expected to rise, SBI Chief Executive John Dludlu told Reuters.
More than 200 malls have been looted or destroyed and over 600 stores burnt or damaged thus far, the South African Property Owners Association said on Wednesday.
The liquor industry said more than 200 liquor shops have been looted in Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng provinces, which are the most affected by the unrest.

Bigger businesses like clothing retailer Mr Price were forced to temporarily shut hundreds of stores after being entirely looted, with some malls also shutting their doors.
""Investing in this particular property here, in this area, I'm out, I'm done,"" Uchendu said.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) saw a surge in government demands worldwide in 2020 to take down content posted by journalists and news outlets, according to data released by the social media platform.
In its transparency report published on Wednesday, Twitter said verified accounts of 199 journalists and news outlets on its platform faced 361 legal demands from governments to remove content in the second half of 2020, up 26% from the first half of the year.
The biannual report on Twitter's enforcement of policy rules and the information and removal requests it receives comes as social media companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube face government scrutiny worldwide over the content allowed on their platforms.
Twitter ultimately removed five tweets from journalists and news publishers, the report said. India submitted most of the removal requests, followed by Turkey, Pakistan and Russia.
The social media platform did not previously track such data on requests pertaining to journalists or publishers. 
India topped the list for information requests by governments in the second half of 2020, overtaking the United States for the first time, the report said.
Some countries have moved to ban or restrict access to social media platforms. On Monday, Cuba began curbing access to Facebook and messaging apps like Telegram amid widespread anti-government protests. Last month, Nigeria banned Twitter from the country and ordered television and radio stations not to use the platform to gather information.
The company said globally it received over 14,500 requests for information from July 1 to Dec. 31, and it produced some or all of the information in response to 30% of the requests. 
Such requests can include governments or other entities asking for the identities of people tweeting under pseudonyms. 
Twitter also received more than 38,500 legal demands to take down various content, down 9% from the first half of 2020, It complied with 29% of the demands.
Twitter has been embroiled in several conflicts with countries, notably India over its new content regulations for social media. Last week, the company said it had hired an interim chief compliance officer in India and would appoint other executives to comply with the rules.
In the updated transparency report, Twitter said the number of impressions, or views of a tweet, that violated Twitter's rules accounted for less than 0.1% of the total global views in the second half of 2020, the first time the platform has released such data.
The company said its technology is proactively identifying more than 65% of abusive content for human review, rather than relying on reports submitted by Twitter users.

Like other social media companies, Twitter has struggled to police hate speech, misinformation and other abuses on its service. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey was among the tech leaders who testified before Congress in March on misinformation.
Major social media companies were under fire this week over racist abuse on their platforms directed at Black players on the England soccer team.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eased from fresh record highs Wednesday as an Apple-led rally in tech was offset by weakness in energy and financials as bond yields slipped on dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Powell.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, though eased from its intraday record of 4,392.60 The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, or 77 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.1%.
Powell cooled expectations for a sooner rather than later taper of Fed bond purchases. There is still long a way to achieve ""substantial further progress"" on maximum unemployment, according to Powell's prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee.
The remarks arrived on signs that price pressures continue to build as producer inflation surprised to the upside.
Producer Price Indexrose 1.0% on the month, above economists expectations of 0.5%.  
The inflation numbers “have been higher than expected and hoped for, but they're actually still consistent with what we've been talking about,” Powell said in his semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. “[I]t's just the perfect storm of high demand and low supply, and it should pass.”
The somewhat dovish remarks kept U.S. bond yields languishing at their lows of the day, adding to concerns that banks will struggle to generate meaningful returns on their loan products in low-rate environment.

(Reuters) - The average S&P 500 (SPX) chief executive made $15.5 million last year, 299 times the pay of the median worker and a higher ratio than in 2019, the top American labor union said on Wednesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic drove layoffs while executive compensation grew.
The ratio was 264-to-1 in 2019. 
“Working people bore the brunt of COVID-19 and its impact on the U.S. economy,"" said Liz Shuler, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation. 
Its annual report is frequently cited as a measure of workforce inequality. 
While many companies reduced salary and bonus payments to executives as they eliminated jobs during the pandemic, those cuts were more than offset by gains in equity compensation, Shuler said on a conference call with journalists accompanying the report's release.
The result was an increase of $712,720 in the average S&P 500 CEO's compensation, which stood at $15.5 million last year, the union said. That was 299 times the average of what they reported in securities filings as the pay of their median worker.
Among all U.S. workers, the average production and nonsupervisory worker earned $43,512 in 2020 according to the U.S. Labor Department, a union spokeswoman said. 

The union cited the figures to argue for the passage of a bill backed by Congressional Democrats known as the PRO Act to make worker organizing easier.
Pay ratios between CEOs and workers were lower in more heavily unionized industries, the AFL-CIO said. Among utilities the average pay ratio was 97-to-1, but stood at 741-to-1 among consumer discretionary companies, for example.

""Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are reclaiming their lives and returning to the skies,"" Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian told investors, while saying the company was mindful of the risks that new COVID-19 variants pose to the recovery.
Net income reached $652 million, or $1.02 per share, in the three months to June 30, helped by billions of dollars in government aid for U.S. airline workers' salaries as well as a strong rise in quarterly revenues, which topped analyst estimates. 
""Domestic leisure travel has fully recovered to 2019 levels, and there are encouraging signs of improvement in business and international travel,"" Bastian said. 
Delta's second-quarter adjusted operating revenue fell 49% from 2019 to $6.35 billion, a marked improvement from the 60.4% slump in the first quarter and above analysts' average estimate of $6.22 billion.
Excluding items such as government payroll support, the company lost $1.07 per share in the second quarter.
Delta's results, the first by a major U.S. airline for the quarter, followed its announcement on Tuesday that it is adding 36 used jets to its fleet beginning next year through deals with aircraft lessors.
It will purchase 27 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-900ERs from funds managed by Castlelake and finance another two with Castlelake while leasing seven Airbus A350 widebodies from AerCap . 
As pandemic-weary people seek vacations, passenger traffic has reached its highest levels since March 2020, forcing U.S. carriers that downsized last year to take stock of their fleets and staffing to support the recovery.
Delta said it hired several thousand people during the quarter and continues hiring.
Corporate travel volumes also improved through the second quarter and could be 60% recovered by September as more offices re-open, Bastian said.
One segment that remains weak, however, is international travel as the United States continues to restrict entry to many travelers, including from Europe, one of Delta's biggest markets.
""Candidly it’s a source of great frustration for us,” Bastian said.
Shares lost 2% in midday trading, giving up opening gains as travel stocks broadly came under pressure.

Looking ahead, Delta said it expects adjusted operating revenue for the September quarter to be down 30% to 35% from two years ago, with the midpoint at $8.47 billion, above a Refinitiv-IBES estimate of $8.23 billion.
Rival American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said Tuesday it could report a small profit in the second quarter, including special items like government aid.

Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound recreation stocks Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), Brunswick (NYSE:BC), and Camping World (CWH). Read on to learn more.While the summer has so far delivered above-average temperatures, people have nonetheless been heading outdoors to enjoy recreational activities after being forced to stay indoors for more than a year. In fact, according to a Study Finds report, nearly three in five Americans have transformed from “indoor people” to “outdoor people” since the pandemic.
As the widespread roll-out of the vaccines continues, several companies in the recreation space have been witnessing increasing demand for their products—such as boats and recreational vehicles (RVs). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 67.7% of the U.S. adult population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Big Four accounting firms dominated auditing of Britain's top listed companies last year and collected higher fees, the industry's regulator said on Wednesday, as long-standing plans to increase competition await implementation.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which regulates auditors, said KPMG, EY, PwC and Deloitte audited all FTSE 100 companies in a roughly even four-way split.
Government-backed reviews proposed a shake-up of the industry after retailer BHS and builder Carillion collapsed following Big Four audits.
The Big Four last year also audited over 200 of the FTSE 250 firms, a segment in which smaller auditors increased their share from 4.8% to 7.6%.
Despite tough economic conditions, the Big Four raised average audit fees by 7.7%, and their rivals by 4.7%, continuing a trend of fees increases since the FRC began collecting data in 2004.
The industry reviews also proposed replacing the FRC with a new, stronger regulator to drive through change, to be called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA).
The government, however, has yet to bring forward legislation to implement the recommendations.
""Improving competition across the audit market and ensuring audit firms focus, above all else, on delivering high-quality audit is essential to improving trust in audit and corporate governance and remains a key priority for the FRC as it transitions to becoming ARGA,"" FRC CEO Jon Thompson said in a statement.
The government has proposed that a challenger firm shares an audit with one of the Big Four firms to gain experience with blue chip clients.
But the plan is facing opposition from companies, with calls to impose market share caps on the Big Four instead.

Iain Wright, managing director at ICAEW, a professional accounting body, said improving audit quality is the key issue and that shared audits would take years to make a difference.
""We think that a market share cap would be a useful additional measure and significantly speed up the process,"" Wright said, adding that establishing ARGA should be the government's top priority.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","Commission proposes $117 billion to remake U.S. train corridor, cut travel times","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. government commission on Wednesday proposed a $117 billion plan to remake the Northeast Corridor - the Boston-to-Washington train route that is the nation's busiest - by 2035, potentially cutting travel times and boosting capacity. 
The route, which runs through major Northeastern cities including New York and Philadelphia, carried about 800,000 passengers a day before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Northeast Corridor Commission said in a statement.
Advocates argue the plan can help take more private cars off clogged American roads and eliminate some airplane trips, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.
The commission - comprised of state, federal and Amtrak national passenger rail officials - said it had only identified $17 billion of the funding needed. It said the $100 billion in unmet costs would be shared between the federal government and states the route runs through.
The panel, created by Congress, said Northeastern state governments, the federal government, eight commuter rail agencies, and Amtrak worked ""to develop a detailed and efficient sequencing of infrastructure investments covering 150 projects.""
The improvements would include repairs or upgrades to rail track, tunnels, bridges and stations and allow for a big jump in train service.
Much of the infrastructure along the heavily used corridor is aging and needs replacement. The crucial 111-year-old Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Tunnel, also known as the North River Tunnel, connecting New York and New Jersey, was damaged in 2012 during Superstorm Sandy.
By 2035, the proposed work would cut nearly half an hour from an average trip of nearly three hours on high-speed Acela trains from Washington to New York and from a little over 3-1/2 hours from New York to Boston. Amtrak also runs slower Northeast Regional trains along the corridor with lower-cost tickets. 
The upgrades along the 457-mile (735-km) Northeast Corridor would allow trains to travel at 160 miles per hour (258 km) on 132 miles, up from the current 32 route miles (52 km) that can travel at 150 mph (240 kph).
The plan ""supports new travel patterns as our economy returns to full strength,"" said Amit Bose, deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration and commission co-chair.
President Joe Biden - once dubbed ""Amtrak Joe"" for his custom of commuting from his home state of Delaware to Washington by train - has called for $80 billion in new spending on high-speed rail projects across the United States. 
A bipartisan infrastructure deal being considered by Congress calls for $66 billion for passenger and freight rail to repair and expand existing rail networks, including the corridor.

Amtrak in April asked for $31 billion from Congress over five years to overhaul the Northeast Corridor.
Amtrak wants to expand across the country and by 2035 add as many as 39 new corridor routes and 166 cities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signs of inflation abound and the world’s biggest asset manager is warning higher prices may be here for a while, yet a sizable chunk of the market appears to be leaning on an age-old adage: don’t fight the Fed.
Treasury yields slid and stocks moved higher with the S&P 500 hitting a record after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in remarks prepared for delivery at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, assured lawmakers that higher consumer prices would prove fleeting and the central bank was unlikely to unwind its easy-money policies sooner than expected.
The moves come despite Tuesday’s consumer price data showing inflation ran hot for the third straight month in June, suggesting that some investors have come around to the Fed’s view regarding the recent inflationary spike. Another report on Wednesday showed U.S. producer prices surged in June, leading to the largest annual gain in more than 10-1/2 years, while BlackRock chief Larry Fink earlier on Wednesday said inflation will likely force the Fed to change policy.
Powell is ""sticking to script"" that inflation is transitory, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
“When you say, ‘Hey, by the way we are going to pretty much keep things as they are,’ that takes the worry of taper off the table,"" Nolte said.
Fed monetary support has been a key pillar for markets since the pandemic, helping buoy the benchmark S&P 500 index to a 95% gain since March 2020. Signs of a faster-than-expected unwind, such as a tapering of its bond-buying program, could spark turbulence in asset prices.
A BofA Global Research survey of fund managers taken earlier this month found that 70% believed the spike in inflation was transitory, with 26% saying it would be longer lasting.
""Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating,"" Powell said, restating the U.S. central bank's faith that current price increases, despite the concerns they are raising about unmoored inflation, are tied to the reopening of the economy and will prove fleeting.
Powell is scheduled to appear before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee at 12 p.m. EDT
Still, some investors believe higher prices may be more sustained. 

""I am not calling for 1970's inflation but I just think we are going to have above 2% inflation .. probably closer to 3.5% to 4.0%,"" Fink, chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), said in an interview with Reuters.
""Does that mean the Federal Reserve will have to change policy? I think so.""

Shares tumbled the most in eight months.
Loans and leases in the consumer banking unit fell 12% from a year earlier. Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $10.3 billion last quarter, the bank said Wednesday. That metric -- revenue from customer-loan payments minus what the company pays depositors -- was less than analysts’ estimated $10.5 billion.
While government aid programs during the pandemic have helped big lenders like Bank of America dodge widespread defaults, they’ve also meant many consumers and businesses haven’t needed to take on new loans or tap lines of credit. That trend, along with rock-bottom interest rates meant to stimulate the economy, have weighed on the profitability of banks’ core lending businesses. While Bank of America’s loan balances remained down from a year earlier, they grew from the first quarter -- the first sequential increase in a year.
“Net interest income and net interest margin both look light,” said Alison Williams, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The improvement is likely not as much as hoped by some.”
Bank of America slid as much as 5% Wednesday morning in New York, the biggest intraday decline since early November. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company has advanced 25% this year, in line with the KBW Bank Index.
Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Bank of America sees organic growth reemerging as vaccination campaigns make progress and the economy recovers.
“Companies need to build inventory and hire workers to meet the growing customer demand,” he said on a conference call with analysts. “This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully will result in more line usage.”
Banks’ Wall Street operations have helped pick up the slack as turbulent markets boosted trading volumes. Companies seeking to stockpile cash, meanwhile, turned to debt and equity financing, and a combination of cheap financing for buyers and attractive valuations for sellers spurred a wave of acquisitions.
Bank of America’s trading revenue fell 14% last quarter, while investment-banking fees fell 1.7%. Financial-advisory fees came in at $407 million in the second quarter, little changed from a year earlier. That contrasts with results at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., which saw an 83% surge in dealmaking fees, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), where that type of revenue climbed 52%.
Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said the second-quarter marked “a turning point” for loan growth and that the bank expects lending to continue increasing as the year progresses. However, he stopped short of reiterating Bank of America’s forecast, provided in April, that net interest income, by the end of the year, would be about $1 billion higher than the $10.3 billion the bank posted in the first quarter.
“This was the quarter where you saw the evidence that we were all looking for that loans were going to start growing,” Donofrio said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday.
Donofrio added later on the analyst call that reaching the previous NII target was “possible” but that a recent significant decline in long-term interest rates “presents a challenge” to achieving that goal.
Bank of America continued to release reserves it built up earlier in the pandemic, anticipating a wave of loan losses that never materialized. The lender released $2.2 billion of reserves in the second quarter, following a $2.7 billion release in the first quarter.
Donofrio said that the bank’s credit losses are at a 25-year low and that he expects reserve levels to continue to decline, though probably not at the pace of previous quarters.

Investing.com – L Brands (NYSE:LB) stock rose 2% a day after the retailer gave an improved outlook for the second quarter.
L Brands is the owner of brands like Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.
The company cited strong customer response to merchandise assortments and disciplined inventory management that enabled a reduction in promotional activity as reasons for raising its guidance.
The company now expects to report second quarter earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30, compared to its previous guidance of 80 cents to $1.00.  
The company expects to report second quarter operating income of more than $400 million for the Bath & Body Works segment, and more than $200 million for the Victoria’s Secret segment.
L Brands reported net sales of $2.35 billion for the nine weeks ended July 3. They were higher by 72% and 12% percent compared to same period in 2020 and 2019 respectively.
The company also announced a $500 million share buyback plan, replacing the previous program of the same size. Of that amount, $36.2 million remained.
In a separate announcement, L Brands said founder Leslie H. Wexner and affiliated stockholders will sell 20.04 million shares of the company with no proceed flowing to it.
L Brands has agreed to repurchase 10 million shares from one of the selling stockholders. The price L Brands will pay for each share will be equal to the public offering price in the offering, less the underwriting discount. The repurchase is part of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program announced today.
The company is currently undergoing a reorganization which will see it operate as two listed entities from next month.
The new company, named Victoria’s Secret & Co, will include Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, PINK and Victoria’s Secret Beauty. L Brands will be known as Bath & Body Works and will be traded on the exchanges under a new symbol, BBWI, starting August 3.    "

The tender, for the rights to use an area of 32 hectares close to Madrid's Barajas airport, is part of Aena's and flag carrier Iberia's plan to raise the profile of the airport and transform it into a larger international hub. 
Aena will seek one or more investors for the wider development project, which will include building offices and hotels close to Europe's fourth-largest airport.
""We open our hand to Aena's partnership with companies which are experts in airport cities,"" Aena president Maurici Lucena told reporters during a digital presentation.
The company expects to announce its investment partner for the Madrid cargo hub in 2022.
As minority partner, Aena will contribute the rights to use the land for the next 75 years. Some 28 hectares of the plot will be used for the logistics hub, while the remaining four will be reserved for green spaces.

Aena has forecast that air travel will make a full recovery from the pandemic's impact by 2025.
Lucena said Aena also plans to launch tenders for other airports in Spain, such as Barcelona's El Prat.

The merger, which will beef up AstraZeneca's line of rare disease medicines, is expected to close on July 21, the drugmaker, a major COVID-19 vaccine producer, said.
The Competition and Markets Authority began a review of the deal in May to check if that could reduce competition in Britain or other markets.
It decided not to initiate a broader probe into the deal following its initial assessment. The clearance follows that from Europe earlier this month.
""We are very pleased to have secured this critical final clearance,"" said finance chief Marc Dunoyer.
A management shake-up at AstraZeneca following the completion of the merger is expected. 
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had said it would move Dunoyer to head Alexion, while Aradhana Sarin will move in the opposite direction to be AstraZeneca's finance head.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 10:33AM ET</span>","Capitalizing on remote work, U.S. cities draw in tech workers","By Danielle Kaye
NEW YORK (Reuters) - At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jaleesa Garland, a marketing manager at an e-commerce startup, came across an opportunity to relocate from the San Francisco Bay Area to Tulsa, Oklahoma - a city previously not on her radar.
It was an enticing offer: $10,000 in relocation assistance and community-building opportunities provided by a recruitment initiative called Tulsa Remote. When the pandemic hit, her company got rid of its San Francisco office and allowed employees to work from anywhere. Garland moved to the south-central U.S. city with a population of about 400,000 in October 2020.
""The pandemic was fundamental to a lot of people's decisions to move,"" Garland said. ""I couldn't afford Bay Area rent, electricity - all of those things add up. I have so much more wiggle room here in Tulsa.""
About 30% of remote workers plan on moving, according to two recent surveys: an April poll of 1,000 tech workers by nonprofit One America Works and a June survey of 1,006 national remote workers for MakeMyMove, focused on intentions for the next 18 months.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter are among the major tech companies allowing employees to work from home if their jobs can be done remotely. According to a Twitter spokesperson, embracing remote work is in part an effort to attract more diverse talent. 
Smaller cities typically aim to support dozens or hundreds of remote-worker moves annually. That does not threaten Silicon Valley's dominance of tech, but it could allow California companies to become more diverse, and it might make them try harder to keep workers.
""The cost-benefit dynamics are quickly shifting away from us, and this must be addressed,"" Jason Baker, senior vice president of transportation, health and housing at the tech industry's Silicon Valley Leadership Group, said in a statement.
And the numbers mean a lot for some towns and cities that have seen ""brain drains"" to larger metropolitan areas, said Prithwiraj Choudhury, associate professor at the Harvard Business School.
Tulsa Remote, which has helped relocate over 900 people since 2018, has received more than 23,000 applications this year, up from around 15,000 in all of last year, a trend echoed by smaller programs in Alabama and Arkansas. Relocation initiatives are redoubling efforts, and new ones, including Chicago, are joining in.
“It's important that we move quickly and tap into this moment of reconsideration,"" said Erin Amico, chief operating officer at P33, a nonprofit that launched a campaign in May to bring tech talent to Chicago.
The number of applicants for the Remote Shoals relocation program in Alabama jumped from fewer than 25 in February 2020 to almost 200 in April 2021. About 50% of program participants have jobs in tech. In January, Remote Shoals successfully petitioned its board to double its funding to $500,000, enough to help relocate 50 people.
More than 90% of first-year Tulsa Remote members have stayed in Tulsa. 

Social media company Reddit has seen employees relocate amid the shift to permanent remote work, but Chief People Officer Nellie Peshkov says ""it's still too soon to tell if it's a long-term shift."" Reddit pays its employees the same regardless of where they're based, while bigger companies cut pay based on cost of living, a strategy some employees publicly criticize.
Garland herself says that, for all the benefits of Tulsa, her ties to the San Francisco Bay Area are likely to pull her back. ""Any move that I make is temporary because at some point in time, I'll go back home,"" she said.

The employee-owned group said a plan to simplify management structures would lead to the roles becoming redundant and with 34 John Lewis stores and 331 Waitrose supermarkets in total, the cuts would average 2.7 management roles per store.
The latest cuts follow a March announcement about the permanent closure of eight stores, hitting 1,465 jobs, and the closure of eight stores in July last year affecting 1,300 positions.
John Lewis said it would try to find new roles for affected employees, or partners as it calls them, who wanted to stay in the business and also try to minimise compulsory redundancies.
In March, the partnership said the ""economic earthquake"" of the pandemic had sent it to a 517 million pound ($718 million) annual loss.
While Waitrose in common with its supermarket rivals has seen both sales and costs increase during the crisis, sales at its department store chain have been hammered by multiple lockdowns which forced outlets to close.
A five-year recovery plan, detailed by Chairman Sharon White in October, requires the group to reduce costs by 300 million pounds per year by 2022 to free up cash to invest in the business.
It is investing about 800 million pounds this year.

""We have announced to our partners our intention to simplify our management structures in Waitrose and John Lewis stores, which will allow us to reinvest in what matters most to our customers,"" the partnership said in a statement.

The brokerage earlier had an outperform rating on the stock with a $130 target.

Fitness equipment makers have had a tricky time responding to consumer demands during the pandemic and after it.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell once again shrugged off the spike in U.S. inflation as only temporary.
In prepared remarks ahead of his testimony to Congress, Powell said ""there is still a long way to go"" to repairing a labor market that is still 7.5 million jobs short of its level before the pandemic erupted in early 2020. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 132 points, or 0.4%, at 35,020 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%. All three indices had fallen on Tuesday in response to the news that U.S. consumer inflation hit an annual rate of 5.4% in June. 
Powell's comments were published within minutes of more data showing the U.S. producer prices rose faster than expected in June too. The PPI leaped to 7.3%, due in large measure to companies expanding their margins against a backdrop of product shortages.
Powell was later contradicted by Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink, who told Reuters in an interview: """"I am not calling for 1970's inflation but I just think we are going to have above 2% inflation .. probably closer to 3.5% to 4.0%."" 
Blackrock's status as the world's largest asset manager means that Fink is seen widely as one of the most influential investors in the world.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock gained 1.9% after Bloomberg reported that it has asked suppliers to deliver 90 million iPhones this year, up some 20% from last year. The request implies confidence that the increased rollout of 5G services around the world will generate big demand for upgrades this year. Bloomberg also noted that the company aims to expand market share at the expense of Huawei, whose business has been hobbled by U.S. restrictions on component supplies. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 2.6% after it reported a set of quarterly numbers that, like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s on Tuesday, were flattered by the release of past reserves. Net interest income fell 6% on the year, reflecting higher costs and rock-bottom interest rates. The outlook for the latter is unlikely to be helped by the Fed choosing not to withdraw monetary stimulus.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 1.8% and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock rose 0.6% after they released rather better figures. 
Airline stocks were also back in favor after selling off in recent weeks amid fears that a new wave of Covid-19 will derail the recovery in air traffic. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 6.8% after it said it will be cash-flow positive in the current quarter, the first time it has managed that since the start of the pandemic. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Southwest  (NYSE:LUV) all rose by more than 1% but Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock edged 0.1%, despite reporting a narrower loss than expected.

The companies called on lawmakers to reintroduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, an amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 named after late U.S. Representative John Lewis, who died nearly a year ago. The act would help prevent voting discrimination and set up an improved system for states to report changes in election law.
""We have a duty to work until every American can participate in our democracy, but that won't happen until every eligible voter in this country has fair, equitable and safe access to voting,"" said Chip Bergh, CEO of  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI), a signatory to the letter, in a prepared statement.
The companies are part of a group of corporate executives called Business for Voting Rights. 
""The business community is proud of our role in encouraging our employees, customers, and communities to exercise their right to vote and have a say in our government,"" the companies wrote in the letter.
U.S. companies have spoken up in support of voting rights reforms and against restrictions on voting that have passed in Republican-controlled states including Georgia. Some companies have come under fire from elected officials for their positions. 
Former President Donald Trump and his supporters made unfounded claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. 

Democrats are expected to reintroduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, Reuters has reported.
Another sweeping voting reform act, the For the People Act, has languished in Congress. President Joe Biden said in Philadelphia on Tuesday that act must be passed, but did not outline a path for it to overcome Republican opposition.

(Reuters) - Global growth will moderate next year but remain at a strong pace, bond manager Pimco said on Wednesday, with a trend toward sustainable investing creating risks and opportunities in some sectors.
Pimco portfolio managers Erin Browne and Geraldine Sundstrom made the forecast in an asset-allocation report sent by a spokeswoman. The managers wrote they expect real gross domestic product in developed markets to grow 6% this year as economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and moderate to 3% in 2022.
""Pent-up demand, high levels of consumer saving, and healthy corporate leverage ratios create a runway for private-sector-led growth,"" they wrote, a background that should make growth-oriented assets attractive.
Slower vaccination rates in emerging markets have delayed their recovery, the report said, setting their GDP to grow at 3.5% this year and accelerate to 5% in 2022.
With the global economic expansion at mid-cycle, they wrote, a factor that could be different than previous recoveries is the growth of investment strategies and business practices focused on environmental, social and governance issues.
The trend should boost demand for sectors like renewable energy, semiconductors and forestry products, but could mean risky transitions for traditional oil and gas companies, Pimco wrote.

Attempts to address inequality like higher minimum wages and better working conditions ""will inevitably have trickle-down effects on smaller businesses,"" the authors wrote.

The district court in Amsterdam said 3,000 euros ($3,538) of compensation was warranted for each buyer of a new Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda that had the software installed, while owners of a second-hand car should get 1,500 euros. 
Volkswagen said it did not agree with the verdict, the latest in a string of payouts and fines for the carmaker since it admitted in 2015 to using fraudulent software to make diesel engines appear cleaner than they were. 
""We believe that car owners in the Netherlands have not suffered any economic loss because of the issue"", Volkswagen said in a statement.
""All vehicles are safe and roadworthy, and no loss in their trade value resulted in the Dutch market because of the issue, as has been confirmed by external valuation experts.""
The compensation covers around 150,000 cars sold by dealers targeted in the class action suit, the court said.
Since the scandal broke, it has cost Volkswagen more than 32 billion euros in fines, refits and legal costs.

The company earlier this month also launched an appeal against an Italian court order to refund consumers participating in a class action lawsuit over its rigging of emissions tests.

(Reuters) - A California electric bus factory just north of Los Angeles looks like a vision of President Joe Biden's battery-powered, American-manufactured, climate-friendly future.
Some 500 unionized workers assemble battery packs, weld frames and install seats, steering wheels and fare boxes, making zero-emission public transportation on a factory floor at BYD North America that is the size of nine American football fields. 
Converting transit buses to battery or fuel-cell power is considered one of the fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which at 29% accounts for the largest share of U.S. emissions. 
But BYD, a unit of China-based BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd, is ineligible for billions of dollars expected to flow out of Washington in coming months to electrify bus fleets, due to a 2019 law written with the company in mind. 
BYD North America spokesman Frank Girardot said BYD is going to fight the decision because it does not receive state funding through its Chinese parent company. ""Locking us out of the lucrative transit market is a bad thing for the American consumer, taxpayer and worker,"" Girardot said.
Taking out one of the two main players in the electric bus sector, even with other rivals expected to ramp up production, means Biden will be hard-pressed to quickly electrify the nation's bus fleet, endangering a key piece of the president's climate agenda, transportation experts warn.
""It's very difficult with the current manufacturing infrastructure in this country and with BYD out of the process, to imagine getting this large fleet changeover anytime soon,"" said Jeff Davis, a senior fellow with the Eno Center for Transportation, which tracks federal transit funding and policy.
The ban also threatens one of the few examples of unionized labor in the green economy, a pillar of Biden's economic agenda, and marks the latest test in the strained relationship between the U.S. government and companies with ties to China. 
A White House official expressed confidence the country can ramp up production, saying a combination of robust federal funding for zero-emissions buses paired with support to vehicle and battery manufacturers would ""build sufficient domestic capacity to support an accelerated transition to EV buses.” 
Biden and a group of bipartisan lawmakers have agreed to spend an unprecedented $7.5 billion to replace some 50,000 diesel buses - or roughly 70% of the U.S. transit fleet - with electric buses over the next eight years, as the administration aims to cut U.S. emissions in half by 2030.
BYD North America mainly competes in the U.S. electric bus market with California-based Proterra Inc. They have each sold about 1,000 electric buses in the United States to date. And Proterra plans to build a domestic cell- manufacturing facility over the next few years. For a FACTBOX of other players in the sector, click 
Other busmakers are expected to help fill the gap over time, including U.S.-based GILLIG, Canadian NFI Group Inc's New Flyer unit, and Canada-based Novabus, a Volvo subsidiary, according to Dan Raudebaugh, executive director of the Center for Transportation and the Environment. 
But they all lag behind BYD in current e-bus production capacity. 
GILLIG, NFI and Novabus are long-standing diesel bus makers that in recent years began selling hybrid, electric and hydrogen versions of their models. Other companies, including Canada's Lion Electric Co and GreenPower Motor, U.S. REV Group (NYSE:REVG) Inc's ENC and UK's Arrival, are also just beginning to ramp up their transit business.
'BUILD AMERICA' vs CHINA FEARS 
Chinese companies have production capacity for a host of other environment-friendly essential items, such as microchips, solar panels and batteries that the United States lacks. As lawmakers seek ""Build America"" provisions in multitrillion-dollar infrastructure spending bills working through Congress, the issue of Chinese ownership could come up often. 
BYD's parent is traded in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company says 60% of its stock is owned by U.S. investors. Warren Buffett claimed an 8.2% stake https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2020ltr.pdf in his last annual letter. 
But after a 2019 congressional report detailed how BYD has benefited from Chinese state-owned investment funds and state subsidies to build battery cells plants that are part of the company's supply chain, it and Chinese rail company CRRC were targeted in an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.
Starting in 2022, federal dollars cannot be used to purchase passenger rail cars or buses from state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, the amendment says. 
""China has poured more than $10 billion into the electric vehicle battery industry since 2012, equating to a subsidy of around $10,000 per electric car, and higher for electric buses,"" the report said. 
BYD North America denies the report and says that, as a separate business unit, it does not receive direct Chinese subsidies, which are instead provided to companies doing business in China.
While Democrats and Republicans agree on little, they have come together on bills targeting China and seeking to limit the country's economic influence. 
Last month, when Democratic Representative Pete DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, took to the house floor to tout the importance of an infrastructure bill and used some of his time to attack BYD without mentioning them by name. 
""We are going to get two Chinese companies, predatory Chinese companies, out of here, making electric buses and rail. DeFazio said. 
BYD PLANS TO FIGHT BACK 
BYD and its North America management are touting its pro-union status as it prepares to fight to be excluded from the amendment. 
It has hired a high-profile lobbying firm, Capital Counsel, with close ties to Democrats and Biden to help convince lawmakers and the White House to make changes to the 2019 law, according to federal lobbying records. 
Robert Diamond, who ran Biden's New York presidential campaign, and Lyndon Boozer, who has deep relationships to House Democrats, are working on behalf of BYD, records show. The firm was paid $50,000 in the first quarter. 
BYD has also hired law firm O'Melveny & Myers to address lawmakers' concerns and write a report arguing it is not the type of Chinese state-owned entity contemplated by the 2019 law.
""There's all this talk about China stealing jobs, but (BYD) is creating jobs, they're offering people careers. People have successful lives, some are buying houses now, the whole community has benefited,"" said Willy Solorzano, organizer with the local chapter of the Sheet Metal Workers union. The average unionized BYD worker makes $20 an hour, he noted. 

Some local transit agencies say leaving out BYD doesn't help them. 
""It takes the most competitive provider out of the market, which creates a collusive environment for the other remaining players to raise the price,"" said Macy Neshati, CEO of Antelope Valley Transit Authority, which serves the Los Angeles county area and has converted almost its entire bus fleet of around 85 buses to battery-powered BYDs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. sportswear maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) on Wednesday lost its fight to stop a probe into its Dutch tax affairs, as Europe's second-highest court backed an EU investigation opened two years ago.
The EU case was part of a crackdown on multinationals' sweetheart tax deals with EU countries that Brussels says gives them an unfair advantage, among them Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Irish tax arrangements, and Fiat Chrysler and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Luxembourg deals.
The Luxembourg-based General Court dismissed Nike's challenge against the EU investigation.
""The (European) Commission complied with the procedural rules, and neither failed to fulfil its obligation to state reasons nor made manifest errors of assessment,"" the court said.
Judges said the EU executive carried out its provisional assessment of the measures at issue in a diligent and impartial manner and that it did not breach the principle of good administration.
The U.S. sportswear maker had objected to the Commission's 2019 decision to investigate five tax rulings issued by Dutch authorities from 2006 to 2015 to the company.
The rulings, two of which are still in force, endorsed a method to calculate royalty payments to Nike's Dutch entities - Nike European Operations Netherlands and Converse Netherlands - for the use of intellectual property.
The Commission said the royalty payments appeared higher than those that independent companies would have agreed between themselves, and may have unduly reduced the Dutch entities' taxable base, giving Nike a selective advantage amounting to illegal state aid.
Nike argued the EU competition enforcer had jumped the gun by opening a formal investigation instead of continuing its preliminary probe and that it had provided insufficient reasoning to show the case constituted Dutch state aid.

The Commission has a mixed record defending its cases in court, losing cases against Apple, Amazon, but winning ones against Fiat Chrysler and Engie.
The case is T-648/19 Nike European Operations Netherlands et Converse Netherlands v Commission.

Investing.com – Airline stocks were trading higher in Wednesday’s premarket following a better than expected second-quarter performance from Delta and positive guidance from American Airlines ahead of its earnings.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) gained the most and was higher by more than 3%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up around 2%, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was up 1.2%.
Airlines were among the worst affected in the pandemic and they are now expected to benefit from booming demand as people seek to travel more after being closeted for a year.
Delta’s $7.13 billion revenue for the quarter ended June topped analysts’ estimate of $6.14 billion.
The airline’s loss in earnings at $1.02 per share was also less than the $1.36 loss analysts estimated.
Delta said it “achieved a solid pretax profit in the month of June” while adding more to its fleet.
“Domestic leisure travel is fully recovered to 2019 levels and there are encouraging signs of improvement in business and international travel,” the airline said in a note.
Delta’s positive commentary follows similar views by American Airlines on Tuesday.
In a filing with the SEC Tuesday, American Airlines said it expects to report between a net loss of $35 million and a net profit of $25 million in the second quarter of 2021.
The airline now expects positive cash flow in its second quarter, the first three-month period when this will happen since the beginning of the pandemic.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>",Ryanair loses challenge against COVID aid for Lufthansa's Austrian unit,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Ryanair on Wednesday lost its challenge against EU-approved state aid for Austrian Airlines, ending a brief run of successful cases brought as governments propped up their national flag carriers during the pandemic. 
Europe's biggest budget airline has launched 16 lawsuits against the European Commission for allowing billions of euros in state aid for individual airlines hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
In addition to Austrian, those carriers include Austrian's parent Lufthansa and Portugal's TAP.
Ryanair took its grievance to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest, after the EU competition enforcer approved Vienna's decision to grant aid to Austrian Airlines in June 2020.
""The aid granted by Austria to Austrian Airlines in order to compensate it for the damage resulting from the cancellation or rescheduling of its flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic is compatible with the internal market,"" the General Court ruled on Wednesday.
""That aid, having been deducted from the subsidies granted, in the same context, by Germany to the Lufthansa group, which also includes Austrian Airlines, does not constitute overcompensation in favour of that group.""
Ryanair said it would appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's highest court.
The General Court this year has ruled in favour of Ryanair in its challenges against aid given to German charter airline Condor, KLM and TAP. 

It has thrown out challenges against aid for SAS, Finnair and Air France. 
The case is T-677/20 Ryanair & Laudamotion v Commission (Austrian Airlines; Covid-19).

Investing.com – Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock was down more than 2% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as its second-quarter revenue fell and came in below expectations.
Revenue dropped 4% to $21.5 billion for the three months ended June 30 as trading income in global markets fell and lending margins were squeezed by rock-bottom interest rates. Net interest income fell 6%.
Analysts had expected the revenue around $21.87 billion.  
Higher expenses on account of bigger pays and benefits, contribution to ESG initiatives and processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits also weighed on the performance of the bank.
The bottom line was boosted by the release of provisions against credit losses that the bank had booked earlier in the pandemic. The bank released reserves of $2.2 billion.
A positive $2 billion tax adjustment related to revaluation of U.K. deferred tax assets also boosted profits that came at $9.2 billion or $1.03 diluted earnings per share.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed in tight trading Wednesday, ahead of eagerly-awaited testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell as well as more inflation data and fresh earnings from some of the country’s senior banks.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down just 6 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 45 points, or 0.3%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen head to Capitol Hill later Wednesday for the two-day semi-annual testimony on the state of the country’s monetary policy.
This comes a day after another stronger-than-expected consumer inflation report, and investors will be looking to see if this latest release changes his belief that inflation will be largely temporary in nature.
Ahead of this potential drama comes the release of producer price data for June, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to have risen by a massive 6.8% on the year, a monthly gain of 0.6%.
In the corporate sector, the banking sector continues to dominate the second-quarter earnings season, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) getting the day off to a disappointing start, ahead of releases from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) before the market opens.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) started the ball rolling on Tuesday, and while they both reported strong headline numbers, underlying profitability at both was seen as flattered by one-offs.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will also report earnings before the markets open, and the market will be looking for commentary on the outlook for travel demand, and prospects for the return of business travel at a time when Covid-19 infections have started to surge again.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also be in the spotlight following a Bloomberg report that the tech giant has asked suppliers for 90 million iPhones this year, a 20% jump from the shipments in 2020.  
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Wednesday after China’s crude imports fell 3% in the first half of the year, raising concerns about slowing demand at the world’s top importer.
That said, the market remains at elevated levels after the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude inventories slid by more than 4 million barrels last week. This would be an eighth straight weekly draw, the longest run of declines since January 2018, if confirmed by government figures later on Wednesday.

The ruling stems from a decision by the European Commission to open an investigation into whether so-called tax rulings by the Netherlands may have given the sportswear giant an unfair advantage over its competitors. Nike challenged the move, saying it was premature and based on insufficient evidence.
The commission “complied with procedural rules and neither failed to fulfill its obligation to state reasons nor made manifest errors of assessment,” the EU General Court ruled on Wednesday, dismissing Nike’s appeal.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has used the bloc’s tough state-aid rules to attack special treatment doled out by member states to multinationals, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX).

In the meantime, the Group of 20 nations have agreed on the outlines of a global corporate-tax pact, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning against “taxes that are discriminatory against U.S. firms.” The EU on Monday postponed plans for a controversial digital levy that was likely to hit Silicon Valley giants’ business in Europe.
The EU’s ongoing probe into Nike’s fiscal arrangements focuses on Dutch tax treatment of Nike European Operations Netherlands BV and Converse BV. The EU said it may have unfairly reduced the tax bill for the Nike group.
The EU probe weighs five tax rulings issued by the Netherlands from 2006 to 2015, that calculated the royalty paid by the Nike units to use intellectual property for Nike and Converse products sold in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

DUBAI (Reuters) - An Abu Dhabi judge referred to arbitration a dispute between NMC and Dubai Islamic Bank and ordered the firm to pay most of the legal costs incurred by the lender, in a case that impacts creditor recoveries in NMC's multi-billion restructuring.
NMC, the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), ran into trouble last year after the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debt.
Its UAE operating businesses were placed into administration in the courts of Abu Dhabi's international financial centre ADGM. Ownership is set to soon move to the creditors.
But the outcome of legal action launched by administrators Alvarez & Marsal in an ADGM court against one of NMC's creditors, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), has left the healthcare company out of pocket and set the stage for more legal action.
""To my mind the overall winners on this phase of litigation are Dubai Islamic Bank,"" Judge Andrew Smith said in a court hearing this week, according to a transcript seen by Reuters.
""It seems to me that the fair order is that the claimants should bear their own costs and should pay DIB 75% of their costs,"" he said.
DIB's legal costs amounted to $1.2 million, the transcript showed.
The judge ordered that NMC's dispute of the validity and nature of DIB's securities received from the company be referred to arbitration in London, effectively staying NMC's main claim in the Abu Dhabi proceedings.
""We are comfortable with the key issues in the case with Dubai Islamic Bank being referred to arbitration, through which the joint administrators will continue to seek to resolve DIB’s position,"" Joint Administrator Richard Fleming told Reuters.
""Our core focus is on the forthcoming launch of the deeds of company arrangement. This will provide the most appropriate mechanism to ensure both the delivery of first-class patient care and a beneficial outcome for all creditors.""

DIB, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, had lent around $400 million to NMC using collateral known as insurance receivables, which relate to payments by insurance companies for medical treatment.
It sought rights over those securities in cases filed in neighbouring Dubai, while Alvarez & Marsal wanted to include them in NMC's administration process, regulated by ADGM.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was up 1.5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after Bloomberg reported that the company has asked suppliers for 90 million iPhones this year, a 20% jump from the shipments in 2020.  
The final offtake could be a few million units short, the report said.
According to the report, Apple’s initial run of a device from the time of its launch through the end of the year has usually hovered around 75 million units.
Placement of higher orders indicates the maker of Macs and iPads is expecting the demand for iPhones to roar, given it will be the tech giant’s first iPhone launch since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. It will also be second set of iPhones with 5G, a critical feature that many consumers are now seeking in phones and as more carriers launch the service world over.   
The report said the company plans updates to all of the current models. The phones are all expected to be announced in September.
In a separate report, Bloomberg said Apple is working on a service to let users pay for purchases in instalments. The world’s most valued company will use Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), its partner since 2019 for the Apple Card credit card, as the lender for the loans, Bloomberg said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The rush to invest in exchange-traded funds focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues jumped in the first half of 2021, with monthly turnover more than tripling to nearly 3 billion euros from a year ago, Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said on Wednesday.
ESG assets are increasingly in demand among investors as companies that perform well on a range of issues from climate change to boardroom diversity are seen as better long-term investments than peers lagging in these areas.
On its Frankfurt-based electronic trading platform Xetra, German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse said ESG ETFs now account for more than 16% of total ETF trading turnover on Xetra compared to 6% a year ago.
    Assets under management for ESG ETFs listed on Xetra amounted to 137 billion euros ($161.62 billion) at the end of June, compared to 43 billion euros a year earlier.
""Europe is at the forefront of ESG investing and that shows up in the development of our ESG ETF strategy,"" said Stephan Kraus, head of the ETF segment at Deutsche Boerse. 
    Bolstered in large part by a swathe of European Union legislation designed to help drive the bloc's transition to a low-carbon economy, ESG ETFs have also benefited from their large holdings of in-demand mega-cap technology stocks.
    While most of the world's ESG funds are actively managed, passive funds are grabbing an increasing slice of the pie as the broader structural trend to access markets through cheaper index-tracking products gathers steam.
    According to Morningstar data, flows into European ESG ETFs amounted to 27 billion euros in the first quarter of 2021, more than four times recorded in the same period last year. 
On a global basis, flows into European focused ETFs are the biggest, dwarfing net flows into U.S. and other markets. 
Total assets under management by ESG funds have swelled to nearly $1.7 trillion at the end of the March quarter, doubling from two years ago though most of the funds are dominated by active strategies.
While a global index of ESG shares has moved pretty much in lockstep with its broader global shares counterpart so far this year, some ESG ETFs have recorded stellar returns, according to Refinitiv data.

    Deutsche Boerse’s efforts to boost its ESG business franchise received a major boost last year when it acquired ESG analytics firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) in March 2020.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Wednesday, as a jump in U.S. inflation raised concerns the Federal Reserve could tighten its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner than previously expected.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.
This cautious tone in Europe follows weakness in Asia and also on Wall Street overnight after data released Tuesday showed the U.S. consumer price index jumped 0.9% in June, climbing 5.4% on the year, the biggest jump in U.S. inflation in 13 years.
“Yet another blowout inflation reading makes it increasingly difficult for the Fed to stick to its position that elevated inflation readings are merely ‘transitory’,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The case for a 2022 rate hike is strong.”
Prices are also rising in Europe, with U.K. inflation climbing 0.5% in June, a gain of 2.5% on the year, and the strongest reading since 2018. Spain and Slovakia also reported CPIs above expectations for June.
Later in the session, investors will carefully study comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in his two-day semi-annual testimony to Congress for any sign that the latest numbers have changed his thinking.  
The second-quarter earnings season continues in the U.S. Wednesday, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due to update before the market opens. 
In Europe,  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock rose over 6% after the German fashion retailer forecast a jump in its annual revenue of between 30% and 35%.  Tele2  (ST:TEL2b) stock also climbed 5% after the Swedish telecoms operator reported a rise of 8% in quarterly core earnings.
Additionally, AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) $39 billion buyout of U.S.-based rare diseases business Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) is expected to close next week as Britain's competition watchdog cleared the deal.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Wednesday after China’s crude imports fell 3% in the first half of the year, raising concerns about slowing demand at the world’s top importer.
However, the market remains elevated, closing Tuesday at the highest level since October 2018, after the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude inventories slid by more than 4 million barrels last week. This would be an eighth straight weekly draw, the longest run of declines since January 2018, if confirmed by government figures later on Wednesday. 
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $75.04 a barrel, after climbing 1.6% Tuesday, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $76.31, after gaining 1.8% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,812.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1787.

Investec, which offers a range of services such as cash management, foreign exchange and lending, is offering the new transactional account to cover everyday needs such as deposits, withdrawals and payments, to make it the main banker for its new clients.
Investec, listed in London and Johannesburg, is targeting firms that see themselves as too small for a specialist lender like Investec. The market is currently dominated by South Africa's four largest banks. 
Investec will offer its account to firms that are at least three years old and have an annual turnover of at least 30 million rand ($2.12 million), said Dhiren Mansingh, head of business transactional banking.
Mansingh said the move would generate new business for Investec in future as customers usually turned to their main bank first for products. 
""A transactional offering is the glue for a client,"" he said. ""We think that this can be a material growth opportunity from a revenue perspective and a client acquisition perspective.""
Investec's research estimates that more 100,000 firms meet the turnover threshold. It wants to see between 5,000 and 8,000 firms that also meet its other criteria using its full suite of products within two to three years, Mansingh said.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",EU set to call time on combustion engine within two decades,"By Nick Carey, Kate Abnett and Ilona Wissenbach
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is set to propose measures on Wednesday, as part of a broad climate package, that signal the end of petrol (gasoline) and diesel car sales within 20 years, and accelerate a switch to electric propulsion.
Many carmakers have already announced huge investments in electrification, partly in anticipation of tougher emissions targets, but want to know whether the EU will back them by building public charging stations, and how soon it wants hybrid electric/combustion vehicles to be phased out.
""By 2040, most carmakers' models will be pretty much electrified anyway,"" said Nick Parker, a managing director at consultancy AlixPartners. ""The question is whether they (the EU) might try to force the journey along the way or leave it up to individual carmakers to decide that path for themselves.""
Last month, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it would stop selling cars with combustion engines in Europe by 2035, and somewhat later in China and the United States, as part of its shift to electric vehicles.
And last week Stellantis, the world's No. 4 automaker, said it would invest more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) by 2025 on electrifying its line-up.
But despite the advances, EU emissions from road transport have actually increased in recent years, and the new measures aim to pull the sector in line with the bloc's overall strategy of getting to net zero emissions by 2050.
The EU executive, the European Commission, will present binding emission targets that in effect make it impossible to sell new fossil-fuel-powered vehicles in the 27-country bloc from either 2035 or 2040, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
An existing target of a 37.5% reduction in CO2 emissions from current levels by 2030 is expected to be replaced by a cut of between 50% and 65%.
CHARGING UP
Low-emission car sales surged in Europe last year, even as the COVID-19 pandemic knocked overall vehicle sales, and one in every nine new cars sold was an electric or plug-in hybrid.
Full electrification is still a long way off, however. Even when buyers are able to afford the considerable price premium for a part- or all-electric vehicle, many have been deterred by ""range anxiety"" due to a lack of public charging stations.
Carmakers have telegraphed that they will accept tougher emission targets only in return for massive public investment in chargers, and there are signs that they have been heard.
Brussels is expected to propose legislation that would require countries to install public charging points at set distances along major roads. 
""An end date for internal combustion engines increases the pressure that the EU and the member states have to take care of the development of the charging infrastructure,"" said Patrick Hummel, an analyst at UBS. ""It cannot be that the automobile manufacturers have to set up the charging stations on their own.""
Some European carmakers such as BMW and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have invested heavily in plug-in hybrids - which have both combustion engines and electric motors - as a way of addressing this problem in the medium term.
But with the green credentials of hybrid cars increasingly being challenged, they fear that much of this investment will be wasted if they are pushed to phase them out too soon.
AlixPartners estimates that for 2021 through 2025, carmakers and suppliers globally will invest $330 billion in electrification, up 41% from its estimate of $250 billion for the period from 2020 to 2024.

All the Commission's proposals will need to be negotiated and approved by EU member states and the European Parliament.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",South African farmers dream of drought cover on climate front line,"By Emma Rumney
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Happy Letsitsa hasn't paid off the money he borrowed to survive a 2019 drought that ravaged his maize and sunflower farm in the South African province of Free State. 
He has no drought insurance. If rains fail again, they could spell the end of his business, which supports his wife, child, father and extended family. 
""It's like going to a casino and playing a high bet,"" he said of running his smallholder farm without cover. ""It's not easy, especially if you've got one stream of income: farming.""
This precarious livelihood is common among the hundreds of thousands of small farmers in South Africa. Most can't access any drought cover in a country that feeds the wider region with staples like maize but is increasingly beset by extreme weather on the front lines of climate change.
It's not just the small guys. The problem is acute among larger farmers too. Most can't afford the main commercial cover for drought, known as multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI), or are not offered it by insurers.
Jan Pretorius in North West province is one of the lucky few that can pay for MPCI, but even he's struggling. His premiums make up around 11% of the roughly 7,000 rand ($492) he spends to plant each of his roughly 600 hectares of maize.
""Where we're farming, nobody is getting multi-peril crop insurance anymore,"" he said. 
Farmers and insurers alike say the insurance system is broken, at a time when droughts are becoming longer and harsher. Some parts of the country are in their ninth dry year, while a drought across much of the southern African region that began in 2018 left tens of millions of people hungry. 
Now a plan has been formulated by insurers and the government for a 3.2 billion rand ($223 million), 10-year state subsidy scheme aimed at fixing the market's problems, according to a South African Insurance Association (SAIA) document seen by Reuters that outlines the previously unreported proposals.
The scheme, which was confirmed by the government, would see commercial grain and oilseed farmers have 25% of their MPCI premiums subsidised. Smallholders in grain, oilseed or livestock would be offered a type of cover called weather index insurance, and have the state pay 75% of their premiums.
Weather index cover is used by millions of farmers in several nations, such as Kenya and India, but has never been tried in South Africa. It pays out automatically when a metric, such as rainfall, is above or below a certain level, removing the need for costly visits to sites to assess claims. 
Nkhangweleni Ramashia, the agriculture ministry's chief director for development finance, told Reuters the subsidy scheme was critical to protect farmers from climate change. 
""I am hopeful,"" he added. ""If you look at the ... changing weather patterns, I don't see how agriculture can survive without a product like this."" 
This was echoed by Richard Boys, a senior manager at Hannover Reinsurance South Africa.
""Without such initiatives, the inevitability of MPCI becoming increasingly unaffordable for farmers and unviable for insurance companies is a real concern,"" he said. 
MOISTURE MEASURED FROM ORBIT
South Africa's agricultural industry employs over 800,000 people. Yet high costs, combined with low availability, mean only 20% of the country's commercial grain farmers have drought insurance, according to the SAIA document. 
There are more than 7,000 commercial grain farmers, according to industry association Grain SA. Estimates of smallholders vary, and the vast majority also don't have drought cover. 
Ramashia, who said his ministry was attempting to eke out the money from its budget for the subsidies scheme, said the priority was to help the smaller farmers.
An industry pilot project that started this month, led by the country's largest non-life insurer Santam, aims to cover around 50 smallholders with a product linked to soil moisture, measured via satellite, according to Santam's head of agriculture Gerhard Diedericks said. 
Premiums would be added onto loans farmers already obtain via agricultural cooperatives or other organisations that provide supplies like seeds
A similar industry pilot led by the state-owned Land Bank is still awaiting approval from the Treasury, the company told Reuters.
Paswel Marenya, a senior economist with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, said weather index insurance was key to increasing smallholders' resilience, and that payouts would be quicker and cheaper for the government. 
However it has problems, he said: farmers can be left worse off if losses exceed the payouts and in some countries take-up has lagged expectations, with even subsidised premiums too high for many poor farmers. 
Subsidy schemes should also come in conjunction with other initiatives, like education or new technologies, he added. 
INSURERS CAN'T HEDGE RISK
The kind of MPCI subsidies being offered to commercial farmers under the plan have shielded farmers from rising premiums elsewhere such as China and the United States, Swapnil Soni, senior underwriter at reinsurer Scor, told Reuters. 
Currently, high costs mean farmers in wetter regions opt to chance it rather than pay, leaving insurers unable to hedge risk in their books. 
""It works against the whole concept of insurance,"" said Soni, adding that reinsurers' South African crop insurance books, including Scor's, had made frequent annual losses. As a result, it had cut back the amount of business it writes in its crop insurance book by roughly 70% as of 2020, he said. 
Many insurers and reinsurers have stopped offering MPCI entirely, according to SAIA's document. The number of hectares insured declined from a peak of 859,000 in 2009/10 to 201,000 in 2017/18, it said. Premium volumes dropped by around two-thirds to 113 million rand between 2012/13 and 2017/18. 
There's little respite, with the weather only likely to get more extreme.
A 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change described the southern African region as a projected climate change hotspot. 
It cited studies showing temperatures have been rising over its subtropical regions at twice the global rate on average over the last five decades and warning of longer and more frequent heatwaves or that the region is likely to become drier even if global temperature increases are limited to 2 degrees Celsius.
Farmer Pretorius in North West province said that, even with drought insurance, he had no control over the weather that could make or break his business. So every day he looks upwards and pleads for the skies to open. 

""I am a Christian. I pray for rain.""

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Italy's Ali Group hungry for bigger slice of U.S. fast-food market,"By Maria Pia Quaglia
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian family business Ali Group expects its planned takeover of U.S. catering equipment rival Welbilt (NYSE:WBT) to boost sales as Americans' appetite for takeaways and meal delivery drives a resurgent U.S. fast-food market, the company told Reuters.
Welbilt, which makes fryers and high-speed ovens for quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and is backed by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, last week said that Ali Group's sweetened takeover bid was superior to its existing agreement with bigger rival Middleby Corp.
On Tuesday Middleby said it didn't plan to increase its bid, ending the months-long tussle between the world's largest food-service equipment companies.
Unlisted Ali Group, which produces the Carpigiani gelato machines that are among the ice-cream machines used by McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), told Reuters the proposed deal would create an industry giant with turnover of $3.5 billion.
It would be the biggest deal for an Italian company in the United States in seven years, Refinitiv data shows, creating a group with a 14,000-strong workforce operating in 34 countries including the United States, Japan and New Zealand.
Ali Group said it couldn't pass up the opportunity to acquire brands that include Frymaster fryers, Garland grills and Merrychef ovens, which quickly deliver fresh, hot food on demand in the United States.
Icahn is Welbilt's largest shareholder with an 8.4% stake, worth a little more than $286 million based on Ali Group's $24 per share bid. 
""We joined the board and we helped to bring in the right kind of management,"" Icahn said in a phone interview. ""This is activism working extremely well. A year ago this stock was $6.50 and now it's $24.""
RESILIENT MARKET
""The transaction would roughly double the portion of our overall sales in the fast-food segment from the current 10-15% while also nearly doubling our presence in North America,"" the company told Reuters, disclosing its strategy publicly for the first time. 
It also said that the U.S. fast-food market has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than other hospitality sectors thanks to strong demand for food delivery during lockdowns.
Miller Pulse data from the beginning of March to mid-May shows average weekly U.S. restaurant sales are up nearly 15% from average 2019 levels.
""For Ali Group this is an opportunity to grow in North America,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Adam Seiden told Reuters last week. 
""It's a very fragmented market and Welbilt is one of few companies that has global scale, a product portfolio across both hot and cold equipment and relationships with large chain customers."" 
North America is the biggest market for food service equipment, according to consultancy Aaron Allen & Associates.
The battle for Welbilt heated up as the hospitality industry and its suppliers began to recover from the pandemic, which the National Restaurant Association estimates shut as many as 110,000 U.S. restaurants, either temporarily or permanently.
Welbilt swung to a net loss of $7.4 million last year, having reported net income of $55.9 million the previous year.
BIG-NAME CLIENTS
Ali Group said it is prudently positive for the coming years, having achieved organic growth of 4% before the pandemic.
Created in 1963 when founder Luciano Berti started a dishwasher business near Milan, Ali Group has grown steadily through acquisitions and had turnover of 2 billion euros ($2.36 billion) in 2019, the company says.
Among big-name clients, Ali supplies Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and luxury hotel chains such as the Four Seasons as well as hospitals, airports, cafes and ice cream parlours.
In a research note on the deal, Barclays analyst Seiden said that Ali Group, despite a net cash position of 573 million euros ($680.32 million) last August, would need to leverage up in a way it hasn't in the company's recent past.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, as a jump in U.S. inflation raised concerns the Federal Reserve could tighten its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner than previously expected.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
European markets have received a weak handover from Asia, and also Wall Street, after data released Tuesday showed the U.S. consumer price index jumped 0.9% in June, climbing 5.4% on the year, the biggest jump in U.S. inflation in 13 years.
“Yet another blowout inflation reading makes it increasingly difficult for the Fed to stick to its position that elevated inflation readings are merely ‘transitory’,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The case for a 2022 rate hike is strong.”
With this in mind, investors will carefully study comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in his two-day semi-annual testimony to Congress, starting later Wednesday, for any sign that the latest numbers have changed his thinking.  
Back in Europe, the U.K. inflation also surprised to the upside, with prices climbing 0.5% in June, a gain of 2.5% on the year. The release of Eurozone industrial production figures for May is due later in the session.
The second-quarter earnings season continues in the U.S. Wednesday following the strong numbers by the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Tuesday. More banks are due to report, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due to update before the market opens. 
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Wednesday after China’s crude imports fell 3% in the first half of the year, raising concerns about slowing demand at the world’s top importer.
That said, the market remains at elevated levels after closing at the highest level since October 2018 as a further drop in U.S. crude stocks indicated demand in the world’s largest consumer is still strong.
The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude inventories slid by more than 4 million barrels last week, which would be an eighth straight weekly draw, the longest run of declines since January 2018, if confirmed by government figures later on Wednesday. 
At 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $75.05 a barrel, after climbing 1.6% Tuesday, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $76.36, after gaining 1.8% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,814.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1790.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 12:01AM ET</span>","Faced with rare protests, Cuba curbs social media access, watchdog says","By Sarah Marsh and Elizabeth Culliford
HAVANA (Reuters) -Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks said on Tuesday, in the wake of the biggest anti-government protests in decades.
Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations throughout the Communist-run country on Sunday to protest https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubas-president-blames-discontent-us-sanctions-2021-07-12 against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties.
Cuba's government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by counter-revolutionaries financed by the United States, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo.
The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly controlled, had largely ended by Sunday evening, as security forces were deployed to the streets and President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution.
But another protest flared late Monday in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera, where one man died and several others, including members of the security forces, were hospitalized with injuries, according to state-run media on Tuesday.
It did not say what caused the death. No other deaths and injuries have been officially confirmed so far.
Hundreds had taken to streets in La Guinera, shouting slogans like 'down with communism,' and 'freedom for the people of Cuba,' according to two residents and video footage seen by Reuters. Some started throwing rocks at security forces who eventually responded with gunfire, said resident Waldo Herrera, 49.
""I think the Communists have lost control, they won't have a solution to this situation,"" he said. ""The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression."" 
A Reuters witness saw dozens of people carrying sticks departing La Guinera late on Monday. 
Activists say the government is using so-called rapid-reaction brigades - government-organized bands of civilian recruits - to counter protesters.
MOBILE INTERNET OUTAGES
They also accuse the government of trying to disrupt communications. Introduced just over two years ago, mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street.
In the capital, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses.
NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday.
""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organize and share news of protests in real-time,"" said NetBlocks director Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality.""
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said that it was concerned about its services being restricted in Cuba, in a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday.
""We oppose shutdowns, throttling, and other disruptions of the internet that limit the debate of our community. We hope connectivity will be restored as soon as possible so that Cubans can communicate with family and friends,"" said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson.
Asked whether the government was intentionally restricting internet connections, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news briefing the situation was ""complicated."" He said power outages could impact telecommunications services and ""Cuba would never renounce the right to defend itself.""
Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it found no blocking of its service.
""Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet we are unarmed,"" said Havana resident Gino Ocumares, as he tried but failed to connect to the web at a government Wi-Fi hotspot. ""The government does not want people to see the truth.""
'PROVOCATIONS'
The protest in La Guinera was spearheaded by ""antisocial and criminal elements"" that had tried to reach the police station with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging infrastructure, said the state-run Cuban News Agency.
When security forces stopped them, they vandalized homes, set containers on fire, and damaged the suburb's electricity wiring, attacking officials with stones and other objects, the agency said.
State-run media also reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the ""provocations.""
Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance.
The Cuban Bishops Conference said in a statement it was worried that the response to protests over legitimate concerns would be ""immobilism"" rather than an attempt to resolve them, and even a counterproductive hardening of positions.
Reaction to the protest in Latin America split along ideological lines, with Mexico's president blaming the U.S. embargo for fomenting the unrest, while Chile and Peru urged the government to allow pro-democracy protests.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.""

State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Havana government to open all means of communication, both online and offline.
""Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways - that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people,"" Price told a news briefing on Tuesday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, after their U.S. counterparts also fell from record highs, over a surprise jump in U.S. inflation. The data also reignited the debate on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.31% by 10:45 PM ET (2:45 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.27%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.23%, even as a COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney was extended for a further two weeks. However, the Westpac consumer sentiment index, released earlier in the day, rose 1.5% in July against the previous month’s 5.2% drop.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.57%, with the U.S. warning American companies of increasing risks of operating in the city earlier in the week.
U.S.-China tensions are rising as U.S. President Joe Biden nominated Alan Estevez to lead the Bureau of Industry and Security that oversees export control and could limit China’s access to technology. The U.S. is also discussing a proposal for a digital trade agreement covering Indo-Pacific economies.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.92% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.80%, with investors still digesting a surprise surge in exports year-on-year in June. They now await further data, including the GDP for the second quarter and industrial production, due on Thursday.
U.S. data released on Tuesday said the core consumer price index (CPI) rose a higher-than-expected 0.9% month-on-month in June. With the inflation print topping forecasts in an indication of higher costs as the country re-opened from COVID-19, it remains to be seen whether the readings will prompt the Fed to begin asset tapering sooner than expected, despite its insistence that inflationary pressures would be temporary.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee later in the week, with his comments to be closely monitored for guidance on the central bank’s next move.
“The debate is centered around where will inflation settle when things normalize about a year from now, is it north of 2% or south of 2%?” Rockefeller & Co. chief investment officer Jimmy Chang told Bloomberg, adding he expects the Powell testimony to sound “fairly dovish.”
In U.S. Treasuries, weak demand for the 30-year bond auction led to a bout of steepening that reversed a flattening move spurred by the U.S. CPI reading. The benchmark 10-year yield remained above 1.41%, however.
On the central bank front, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25%. The Bank of Korea and the Bank of Japan will hand down their respective decisions on Thursday and Friday.
Also on investors’ radar is the earnings season, with optimism for the economic recovery from COVID-19 driving global stocks to a record high. However, earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) that kicked off the season were mixed."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's chief scientist has advised individuals against mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers, saying such decisions should be left to public health authorities. 
""It's a little bit of a dangerous trend here,"" Soumya Swaminathan told an online briefing on Monday after a question about booster shots. ""It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who will be taking a second, a third and a fourth dose.""
Swaminathan had called mixing a ""data-free zone"" but later clarified her remarks in an overnight tweet.
""Individuals should not decide for themselves, public health agencies can, based on available data,"" she said in the tweet. ""Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited - immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated.""

The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on vaccines said in June the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) vaccine could be used as a second dose after an initial dose of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), if the latter is not available. 
A clinical trial led by the University of Oxford in the UK is ongoing to investigate mixing the regimen of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. The trial was recently expanded to include the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Novavax Inc vaccines.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower on Tuesday after hitting record highs earlier in the session, with investors digesting a jump in consumer prices in June and earnings from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs that kicked off the quarterly reporting season.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached fresh record highs but quickly fell into negative territory after an auction of 30-year Treasuries showed less demand than some investors expected and pushed yields higher. 
Data indicated U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years last month, while so-called core consumer prices surged 4.5% year over year, the largest rise since November 1991.
Economists viewed the price surge, driven by travel-rated services and used automobiles, as mostly temporary, aligning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-standing views. 
""Any time you get an uptick in interest rates the stock market is going to get nervous, especially on a day like today,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc gained 2.3% after raising its full-year earnings forecast, betting on accelerating demand as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease. 
June-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 66%, according to Refinitiv data, with investors questioning how long Wall Street's rally would last after a 16% rise in the benchmark index so far this year.

The environmental plans of big carbon emitters are coming under increasing scrutiny from investors and climate change activists concerned about such companies' ability to meet carbon targets, with the UK government targeting net zero carbon emissions in Britain by 2050. 
Go-Ahead, which runs buses in London and several UK regions as well as operating train services in southeast England, said it will cut emissions by 75% by 2035 and to net zero by 2045. 
The group said it will buy electric and hydrogen fuel cell buses as it gradually replaces its fleet of 5,000 buses with zero-emission vehicles by 2035 while also making all of its trains electric by that date. 
That will require a substantial investment on Go-Ahead's part, with electric buses costing roughly twice as much as diesel alternatives, though prices are expected to fall over time. Go-Ahead will also need to invest in charging points at bus depots. 

Chief Executive David Brown said radical change is needed in the push for net-zero emissions.
""We hope our commitment will be matched by a broader shift in public policy on transport by encouraging people to walk or cycle where possible, use buses and trains as an alternative but only use a car if absolutely necessary,"" he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is seeking to elevate Britain's environmental credentials as he prepares to hold the United Nations' Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Scotland later this year.
The government said that it would ban the sale of smaller diesel trucks from 2035, and larger ones weighing more than 26 tonnes from 2040, or earlier if feasible.
It also set out plans to create a net zero rail network by 2050 and ensure net zero domestic aviation emissions by 2040.

""It's not about stopping people doing things: it’s about doing the same things differently.""

As world powers try to slash carbon emissions by scrapping the fossil-fuel guzzling internal combustion engine, Britain has already pledged to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2030. 
On aviation, the government said it was launching a consultation to achieve a net zero emissions target by 2050, with ""an action plan for how it can be achieved – ensuring everyone can continue to fly for holidays, visits to family and business without contributing to climate change.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork processor, has stopped slaughtering pigs in the United States' so-called ham capital, where the company was founded 85 years ago.
The end of slaughtering in Smithfield, Virginia, is the latest reconfiguration for the company's namesake plant and follows a months-long internal review of its East Coast operations, Smithfield Foods said in a statement.
The company, owned by Hong Kong-listed WH Group (OTC:WHGLY), is shifting slaughtering to some of its 47 other U.S. facilities and spending $5 million to upgrade the Virginia plant to produce more packaged bacon, ham and other pork products, said Keira Lombardo, chief administrative officer.
Smithfield, Virginia, is a tourist destination based on its history as Smithfield Foods' hometown and boasts a museum featuring the world's oldest ham.
The company retooled the plant in 2019 to ship hog carcasses to China, the world's top pork consumer, and again last year to supply more pork to U.S. customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S. meat companies came under scrutiny during the pandemic as plant workers got sick and died, and slaughterhouse shutdowns highlighted supply-chain vulnerabilities.
Smithfield's facility has the capacity to kill about 10,000 hogs a day but has been slaughtering roughly 7,000 to 7,500 hogs daily, said Steve Meyer, economist for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture. He said there are fewer hogs along the eastern seaboard after farms closed.
""Taking that plant out probably doesn't have much of an impact,"" Meyer said. ""It leaves us snug as a country as far as hog supply verses capacity this fall.""

One East Coast hog supplier, Maxwell Foods, said last year it would close and filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Smithfield Foods.
Smithfield Foods, which named a new chief executive on Friday, will reassign some of the Virginia plant's 1,900 employees within the facility and a small number will have positions available at other locations, according to the company.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) -Elon Musk told a judge on Tuesday Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc had to buy SolarCity in 2016 because the failing solar panel company was essential to the electric vehicle maker's long-term goal of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.
The celebrity chief executive completed about eight hours of testimony over two days to defend himself against a lawsuit brought by union pension funds and asset managers who allege he strong-armed Tesla directors into buying the cash-strapped SolarCity for $2.6 billion.
Musk at the time owned a 22% stake in both Tesla and SolarCity, which was founded by his cousins. The Tesla shareholders want Musk to be ordered to return the value of the deal to Tesla.
Musk completed his testimony by fielding several questions about the timing and necessity of the deal from Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights, the judge who will decide if Musk is liable.
Musk said Tesla was struggling in 2016 to develop its Powerwall battery system because it was difficult to integrate with other solar power systems.
""If we have a whole bunch of third-party solar systems, it's a messy situation. We needed solar within Tesla,"" he told the judge.
Shareholders have questioned the need to buy SolarCity and asked Musk if other solar companies were considered as acquisition targets.
Central to the case are claims that despite owning only 22% of Tesla, Musk was a controlling shareholder due to his ties to board members and domineering style. If plaintiffs can prove this, it increases the likelihood that the court will conclude the deal was unfair to shareholders. 
Musk has consistently told the court that the Tesla board primarily handled the SolarCity deal and that he recused himself from price negotiations.
Shareholder attorney Randall Baron on Tuesday pressed Musk to explain meeting notes taken by a financial advisor showing Musk suggested the board offer a $28.50 share price for SolarCity. 
""I was making the obvious point that any offer, if not publicly defensible, will be rejected by SolarCity shareholders,” Musk said.
In response to questions from his own lawyer Evan Chesler, who was trying to show Musk did not dominate board discussions, Musk noted his suggestion was overruled at that meeting.
Baron asked Musk to explain why he reviewed deal packets for the Tesla board before they were sent to directors, suggesting the CEO was controlling the flow of information.
“It’s part of the board process to make sure they have full and accurate information,” Musk testified.
Musk repeatedly defended the SolarCity deal by saying the company had to be quickly acquired or find financing to solve its dangerous cash shortage.
Legal experts said the judge will be looking for evidence that Musk threatened board members or that directors felt they could not stand up to him. 
Elon Musk's brother Kimbal, a Tesla director who is listed in court documents as a witness for both sides, was asked by the plaintiffs' lawyers if he thought his brother's actions in regard to the SolarCity deal were appropriate considering he said he recused himself.
Kimbal Musk responded that he did not understand how a CEO could be recused from deal negotiations.
""How could the CEO not be involved in some form,"" he said. ""That sounds not possible."" 

Kimbal Musk, other board members and others involved in the 2016 deal will testify for the duration of the trial, which started on Monday and is expected to last two weeks.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican telecommunications giant  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) reported on Tuesday that its second quarter net profit more than doubled from a year earlier, boosted by foreign exchange gains.
The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said profit surged to 42.8 billion pesos ($2.1 billion), beating the Refinitiv forecast of 25.15 billion pesos.
Foreign exchange gains drove down the local currency value of the company's U.S. dollar debt. The Mexican peso appreciated 2.4% in the quarter against the U.S. dollar. 
""The market should react favorably to the report,"" said Marissa Garza of Banorte, adding that the company's advance of 4.2 million subscribers added in the quarter ""also stood out"". 
The company's revenues rose 0.4% to 252.5 billion pesos from 251.58 billion pesos during the year-earlier period, according to a filing with the Mexican stock exchange. 
EBITDA was 84.9 billion pesos, an increase of 2.8% in nominal terms compared to the second quarter of the previous year, slightly ahead of forecasts. 

America Movil's operating income was up 9.3% to 44.7 billion pesos in nominal terms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously on Tuesday to finalize a $1.9 billion program to reimburse mostly rural U.S. carriers for removing equipment from telecommunications networks from Chinese companies deemed national security threats like Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
Last year, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats to communications networks - a declaration that barred U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies. The FCC in December adopted rules requiring carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to ""rip and replace"" that equipment.
""There is a serious risk that this equipment may be manipulated, disrupted or controlled by foreign actors,"" Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. ""We will evaluate network after network, base station after base station and router after router until we have rooted out our equipment that could undermine national security. It's a daunting task.""
The issue is a big one for rural carriers that face high costs and difficulty finding workers to remove and replace equipment.
Huawei said in a statement the rules ""are simply an unrealistic attempt to fix what isn’t broken. The FCC initiative only creates extraordinary challenges for carriers in the most rural/remote areas of the U.S. to maintain the same high level and quality of service they provide to their customers without disruption."" 
The FCC's final order expands the companies eligible for reimbursement from those with 2 million or fewer customers to those with 10 million or fewer customers.
The FCC in September 2020 estimated it would cost $1.837 billion to remove and replace Huawei and ZTE equipment from networks.
Last month, the FCC voted to advance a plan to ban approvals for equipment in U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies deemed national security threats like Huawei and ZTE. The FCC could also revoke prior equipment authorizations issued to Chinese companies. 
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks.
The affected companies included the previously designated Huawei and ZTE, as well as Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. 
In August 2020, the U.S. government barred federal agencies from buying goods or services from any of the five Chinese companies.

(Reuters) -American Airlines said on Tuesday it expects positive cash flow in the second quarter for the first time since the pandemic began, reversing a trend of cash burn of about $100 million a day when global travel had ground to a halt.
The company flew more than 44 million passengers in the quarter, over five times higher than last year, and forecast a daily cash build of $1 million for the period, ending it with more than $21 billion of total available liquidity. (https:// ""The improved liquidity is encouraging because it suggests that forward bookings are also strong,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. ""This suggests we turned the corner in the domestic market and we should see improving sequential quarter results."" U.S. air travel demand has been rising steadily for months as more Americans get vaccinated and travel restrictions ease.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday said it charged blank-check company Stable Road Acquisition Corp, its sponsor SRC-NI, space exploration company Momentus Inc and two executives for misleading claims over their planned merger.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the companies and Stable Road Acquisition Company Chief Executive Brian Kabot agreed to pay $8 million to resolve allegations they misled investors about Momentus Inc.'s technology and national security risks associated with its former CEO Mikhail Kokorich.
The entities, whose lawyers did not respond immediately to requests for comment, settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the allegations. An attorney for Kokorich, who is fighting the SEC's charges in court, said his client ""looks forward to a resolution of this matter which is favorable to him.""
The enforcement case marks the latest escalation in the SEC's crackdown on Wall Street's special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, frenzy, which has reached a record over $100 billion this year.
The SEC's action is the first targeting all sides of a SPAC transaction as well as executives in an investigation that took under a year, an SEC official said. 
According to the SEC, Kokorich and Momentus, an early-stage space transportation company, repeatedly told investors that it had ""successfully tested"" its propulsion technology in space, when its only in-space test had failed to achieve its primary objectives or demonstrate the technology's commercial viability.
The regulator also alleged that Momentus and Kokorich misrepresented the extent to which national security concerns involving Kokorich undermined Momentus' ability to secure governmental licenses essential to its operations. The SEC accused Stable Road, its sponsor and Kabot of negligence-based fraud. 
SPACs are listed shell companies used to take private companies public, sidestepping the more traditional and lengthy initial public offering process. SPAC critics say the deal structures create conflicts of interest and frequently lack sufficient checks and balances to protect investors.
The settlement gives Stable Road's private investors the chance to redeem their cash, while retail investors will be informed of the extent of redemptions before voting on whether to greenlight the merger next month. SRC-NI will also forfeit 250,000 shares it would have otherwise received if the deal goes through.
""This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions, as those who stand to earn significant profits from a SPAC merger may conduct inadequate due diligence and mislead investors,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.
Momentus said in October it would go public through a $1.2-billion merger with Stable Road, which was lowered to $700 million last month. Stable Road share prices have slumped 60% from a February peak above $29.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday strengthened its warnings to businesses about the growing risks of having supply chain and investment links to China's Xinjiang region, citing forced labor and human rights abuses there.
""Given the severity and extent of these abuses, businesses and individuals that do not exit supply chains, ventures, and/or investments connected to Xinjiang could run a high risk of violating U.S. law,"" the State Department said in a statement. 
Signaling broader U.S. government coordination on the issue, the Department of Labor and the U.S. Trade Representative's Office joined in issuing the updated advisory, first released on July 1, 2020 under the Trump administration by the State, Commerce, Homeland Security and Treasury departments.
The Treasury Department declined to comment on a Financial Times report that the United States would impose more sanctions this week in response to China's crackdowns in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters they were hearing the administration was preparing new sanctions, but had no details on the timing. Another source told Reuters the administration could announce a similar business advisory covering Hong Kong as soon as Friday, based on deteriorating conditions there.
The new advisory announced on Tuesday strengthens warnings to U.S. companies, noting they are at risk of violating U.S. law if their operations are linked even ""indirectly"" to the Chinese government's ""vast and growing surveillance network"" in Xinjiang. The warning also applies to financial support from venture capital and private equity firms. 
It also summarized previously announced actions taken by the Biden administration to address alleged forced labor and rights abuses in Xinjiang, including a U.S. Customs and Border Protection ban on some solar product imports, and sanctions on Xinjiang companies and entities. 
On Friday, the administration added 14 Chinese companies and other entities to its economic blacklist over alleged human rights abuses and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang.
The advisory said China's government continues ""horrific abuses"" in Xinjiang and elsewhere ""targeting Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and ethnic Kyrgyz who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups.""
China denies abuses and says it has established vocational training centers in Xinjiang to address religious extremism.
USTR Katherine Tai praised Canada, Mexico and other U.S. partners and allies for committing to ban the import of goods made with forced labor.
""I want to commend our allies for sending a clear sign that there is no place for forced labor in a fair, rules-based international trading system,"" she said in a statement.
President Joe Biden has sought to enlist help from U.S. allies to hold Beijing accountable for human rights abuses and what the White House says are increasingly coercive foreign and trade policies.

State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing Washington would continue to hold Hong Kong authorities accountable for the erosion of the rule of law and would impose ""costs and sanctions"" on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses, including forced labor.
He said risks to the rule of law that were formerly limited to mainland China were now increasingly a concern for Hong Kong, but made no specific mention of any new measures.

And because this improvement trend is likely to continue, we think fundamentally sound semiconductor companies Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Himax (HIMX) should benefit significantly from growing demand. Conversely, the poor fundamentals and declining financials of Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) may not allow these names to capitalize on the industry headwinds. So, these two stocks are best avoided now. Read on for details.The increasing need for efficient tech products and solutions from several industries has fueled the growth of semiconductor sales. The global semiconductor industry generated $43.60 billion in sales in May 2021, up 26.2% year-over-year. Semiconductor sales, as reported by The Semiconductor Industry Association, on a three-month moving basis as of May were higher than any previous month in the market’s history, indicating improving semiconductor production.
Favorable government policies and private investments to address a global semiconductor shortage have helped the industry achieve this significant improvement in sales.

869,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 05:19PM ET</span>","Powell, Oil Inventories, Earnings: 3 Things to Watch","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- Stocks eased from record highs into the close Tuesday, as investors weighed better-than-expected results from banks, and a jump in bond yields, a day ahead of Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's two-day testimony.
Bond yields were given a lifeline following U.S. bond auction pointing to waning demand for bonds that pushed prices lower and yields higher. The initial move lower in rates had arrived on the back of a monthly consumer inflation report that showed the pace of price pressures remains at multi-decade highs.
The outlook on growth, meanwhile has been soured somewhat by a spike in Covid-19 cases as the delta variant first identified in India continues to spread, threatening the summer of travel.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Powell Takes Stand
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is set to take the stand on Capitol Hill to testify before Congress in his two-day mandated semiannual testimony on the state of monetary policy.
The Fed chief isn't expected to offer any insight into monetary policy, but investors will be watching remarks on the labor market and inflation. Powell has previously suggested that he expects the temporary factors weighing on labor supply to fade. Any deviation in tone that suggest the Fed's conviction to cast a wider net to allow a broader sector of the labor market to recover, could suggest that inflation may be starting to worry the Fed.
2. Banks Continue Earnings Parade; Delta Air Lines Also in Focus
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are expected to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday before markets open.
Bank of America is expected to report EPS of $0.77 on revenue of $21.87 billion. Wells is forecast to generate EPS of $0.95 on revenue of $17.82 billion. Citigroup, meanwhile, is expected to generate earnings of $1.99 on revenue of $17.82 billion.
The quarterly results from the trio of banks followed better-than-expected results from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday. But doubts over loan demand and a backdrop of weaker yields continued to weigh on the sector.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will report earnings before markets open. Beyond earnings, investors are eager for commentary on the outlook for travel demand, and prospects for the return of business travel at a time when Covid-19 infections have started to surge again.
3. Crude Oil Inventories 
Oil prices remained bid going into the weekly energy inventory data due Wednesday following positive data on Tuesday showing a sharp draw in crude and gasoline stocks.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.1 million barrels for the week ended July 8, the API reported. That compared with a draw of 8.0 million barrels the prior week.
Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the threat that the resurgence in Covid-19 cases pose to the demand outlook.
The official government inventory report due Wednesday is expected to show weekly U.S. crude supplies declined by about 4.4. million barrels last week."

(Reuters) -A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday raised concerns that Limetree Bay refinery on the Virgin Islands may not have enough money to get through the early days of its Chapter 11 restructuring. 
""I'm very worried it's not enough money,"" Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge David R. Jones said during a hearing on Tuesday. 
Jones, who is based in Houston and a veteran of a number of refinery restructuring in the southern district of Texas, added that his liquidity concerns are among the worst he has ever had. 
The refinery is due to receive up to $25 million in interim financing as it tries to restructure nearly $2 billion in debt. Jones approved the financing.

Limetree filed for Chapter 11 protection on Monday after spending more than $4 billion trying to restart the refinery on St. Croix.
But lawyers for Limetree say the refinery needs at least $150 million in funding to maintain operational capabilities, complete ongoing repairs and retrofitting, fund necessary repairs identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and establish a reserve for potential expenses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden plans to nominate a House aide who has worked extensively on oversight and consumer issues to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the White House said on Tuesday.
Richard Trumka Jr. is general counsel and staff director of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform's subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. He was previously an assistant attorney general in the Consumer Protection Division of the Maryland Attorney General's Office.
Trumka, the son of Richard Trumka who is president of the 12.5-million-member AFL-CIO, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittee chaired by Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, has investigated a number of consumer product issues including the safety of baby food, dangerous pet collars and advertising for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube Kids.
The commission is currently divided 2-2 between Republicans and Democrats.
The White House announced on July 2 that Biden planned to nominate Alexander Hoehn-Saric, a Democrat who is chief counsel for the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Consumer Protection, to chair the CPSC, along with a lawyer at the agency for another commissioner slot.
The White House also said Biden plans to nominate Mary Boyle to the commission. She is the CPSC's current executive director and has spent more than a decade at the agency in senior positions.

In December 2019, Senate Democrats said the CPSC was inappropriately deferential to companies it investigates. Settlements reached by the commission under Republican then-President Donald Trump ""are at odds with traditional recall agreements negotiated by the CPSC,” the Senate Commerce Committee report said.
“Rather than providing consumers with a specific remedy that repairs all impacted products or a refund to remove the dangerous products from homes, these recalls perversely serve as marketing tools to allow the recalling company to sell additional products,” the report found.

(Reuters) - Virgin Galactic Holding Inc acknowledged on Tuesday that billionaire founder Richard Branson never rode a bicycle to the launch site of his space flight on Sunday, as depicted in a highly publicized video included in the company's webcast of the event.
The video clip showed Branson riding his bike toward New Mexico's state-owned Spaceport America near the town of Truth or Consequences, flanked by two SUVs, and handing his safety helmet to an assistant upon arrival.
Branson, 70, is then seen greeting crewmates dressed in their flight suits with a hug, with one of them, Beth Moses, the company's chief astronaut instructor, telling him, “You’re late, hurry up.”
    On Tuesday, a Virgin Galactic official, speaking anonymously, affirmed to Reuters by text that the video in question was filmed on July 5, the Monday before the flight, and that Branson did not ride his bike at all the day of the launch. 
“The footage of Sir Richard Branson shown during the event Sunday was prerecorded and misidentified in the broadcast. We regret the error and any confusion it may have caused,” the official said in a text message.
It was unclear whether the disclosure that the Sunday cycling ride was fictional would complicate Virgin Galactic's cross-promotional deal with Wisconsin-based Trek Bicycle Corp. Trek had claimed that Branson rode one of its custom-made bikes to the spaceport on launch day.
Representatives of Trek were not immediately available to comment on the matter.
Branson has touted his rocket plane ride, the company's first fully crewed test flight of the vehicle to space, as a precursor to a new era of astro-tourism, with the company he founded poised to begin commercial operations next year.
The purported Sunday bike ride seemed to typify his public persona as the adventuresome business executive whose Virgin brands - from airlines to music companies - have been associated with ocean-crossing exploits in sailboats and hot-air balloons. 
The bicycle video clip was posted to Branson's Twitter feed https://twitter.com/i/status/1414205913200746498 shortly before Sunday's launch. Virgin also broadcast the clip, with the tagline ""earlier today,"" during its livestream presentation https://youtu.be/RTpWYWIfP7Y?t=1102 of the flight. 

Branson, himself, made mention of the bike ride from the stage of a post-flight celebration back at the spaceport, telling a crowd of supporters, ""It’s so awesome to arrive on a bicycle, across this beautiful New Mexico countryside.”
Reuters, along with many other news outlets, included the videotaped account of Branson's bike ride in some of its launch-day coverage on Sunday. Reuters dropped the bicycle ride from its story when doubts about its timing emerged early on Sunday.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Bond yields jumped and global share prices slipped after posting new highs on Tuesday as the biggest hike in U.S. inflation in 13 years rattled investors who fear rising interest rates could end a stock market rally that has doubled prices from 2020 lows.
The yield on U.S. Treasury debt initially fell on news the U.S. consumer price index in June jumped 5.4% year over year, the largest gain since August 2008, the Labor Department said. 
But a weak Treasury auction sparked a 4.7-basis-point jump in the benchmark 10-year note to 1.41% after initially falling to 1.343% after the CPI data was released.
The inflation spike followed a 5.0% increase in the 12 months through May, while CPI rose 0.9% month over month after advancing 0.6% in May, gains that unnerved investors.
Stocks on Wall Street at first took the CPI data in stride, bidding up technology stocks that typically thrive with low interest rates. 
The $24 billion of 30-year bonds were sold to yield 2.00%, or more than two basis points above where the debt had traded before the auction.
The jump in inflation ultimately is a negative hanging over a market that has enjoyed a remarkable rally since the lows of March 2020, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Inflation is not the worst news for stocks, but it's very bad news for bonds,"" Meckler said. ""You're starting to see some of the potential negatives that could bring an end to this incredible rally this year."" 
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, fell 0.14% to close at 726.33, after earlier setting a new high at 728.77. In Europe, the broad FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.07% to set a record close of 1,779.34.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31% to 34,888.79, the S&P 500 lost 0.35% to 4,369.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.38% to 14,677.65.
Stock investors could re-enter the market to buy ""on the dip"" as investors wait to see if the Federal Reserve takes aggressive steps to halt rising inflation, Meckler said. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.
""A lot of this will play into the Fed's transitory story,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York, said about the CPI data. ""You can argue that a lot of this (inflation spike) is due to the recovery.""
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.56% to 92.778. The euro fell 0.70% to $1.1776, while the Japanese yen was last up 0.24% at $110.6200. 
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1%, its best daily gain since late June, led by a 1.6% rise in Hong Kong, where tech stocks rose broadly. Japan's Nikkei was up 0.5% while Australian shares closed broadly flat.
In Hong Kong, tech behemoth Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd jumped 3.9% after China's antitrust regulator on Tuesday approved its plan to take China's No.3 search engine, Sogou (NYSE:SOGO) Inc, private in a $3.5 billion deal.
Euro zone government bond yields have fallen in line with U.S. Treasuries in recent weeks, and are running close to their lowest levels since early April.
Germany's 10-year bond yield was unchanged at -0.297%, close to a three-month low of -0.344% hit last week.
South Africa's rand dropped to a three-month low, slipping 1.2% to 14.4000 against the dollar, as violence escalated over the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. 
Brent crude settled up $1.33 at $76.49 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.15 to settle at $75.25 a barrel.

Gold was little changed as a firmer dollar offset support from bets that the Fed was unlikely to respond to the jump in U.S. inflation with immediate monetary tightening.
U.S. gold futures settled up 0.2% at $1,809.90 an ounce.

Below is the status of the cases, as well as government probes of Apple and Amazon.com.
Two lawsuits against Facebook:
In a stunning defeat, Judge James Boasberg said the Federal Trade Commission - which had sued Facebook in December asking that Facebook be forced to sell WhatsApp and Instagram - failed to show that Facebook had monopoly power in the social-networking market, among other problems. He said, however, the FTC could file a new complaint by July 29.
He threw out a related state lawsuit entirely, saying that the attorneys general had waited too long. They are looking at their options.
Four lawsuits against Google
The U.S. Justice Department sued Google in October, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals. A trial date was set for Sept. 12, 2023.
A lawsuit by 38 U.S. states and territories accuses Google of abusing its market power to try to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in phones. This was consolidated with the federal lawsuit for purposes of discovery. 
Texas, backed by other states, filed a separate lawsuit against Google, accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business.
Dozens of state attorneys general sued Google on July 7, alleging that it bought off competitors and used restrictive contracts to unlawfully maintain a monopoly for its app store on Android phones.
Justice Department investigates Apple:
This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store because they compete with Apple's new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality apps in the app store.
Justice Department probing Facebook and Amazon:
In July 2019, the Justice Department said it was expanding its Big Tech probes to include ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" - an apparent reference to Facebook and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Federal Trade Commission on Amazon:
In its investigation of Amazon, the FTC is likely looking at the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.

Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung that even though a dozen European carmakers had already announced they would switch to zero-emissions cars between 2028 and 2035, a legal cut-off date was still needed.
""We will still set out an end date after which, all cars will have to be emissions free,"" she said, without naming that date. ""Otherwise there will be a lack of certainty and we won't achieve our goal of climate neutrality by 2050.""

The European Commission on Wednesday unveils its ""Fit for 50"" package of proposals which, if approved by the 27 member states, would put the bloc - the world's third-largest economy - on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing planet-warming emissions by 55% from 1990 levels.
The package being released will face months of negotiations between member states and the European Parliament and is likely to be the target of ferocious lobbying efforts by the many industries affected.

Since Bitcoin was launched in 2009, more than 4,000 other cryptocurrencies have been created. The current total market cap is presently over $1.5 trillion and as of February of this year it’s estimated more than 100 million people are using cryptocurrencies around the world. 
While there are many doubters that view cryptocurrencies as nothing more than a scam, others see blockchain technology, the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrencies, as revolutionary. Their belief is that this technology will disrupt and disintermediate money, banking, and finance in the same way that the Internet has done to information. At the moment, most cryptocurrencies have few applications beyond speculation. As a result, most of its massive gains are due to a combination of people getting excited about the technology’s future potential, while others are simply chasing returns. However, some interesting developments are happening on the margins with more practical applications for cryptocurrencies such as NFTs, decentralized finance (Defi), social tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Tuesday, as banks fell even as quarterly results surprised to the upside, while data showed inflation continues to run at its hottest pace in decades ahead of Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Wednesday.    
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, after hitting a record high of 4,392.30 earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%, or 107 points, though had notched a intraday record of 35,018.79. The Nasdaq was down 0.4%, easing from its intraday record of 14,803.70.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) got their quarterly earnings underway, with a beat on both the top and bottom lines. But uncertainty over the outlook for loan demand and the backdrop of weaker U.S. bond yields stoked worries about further growth. 
But financials eased slightly off their the sessions lows of the day thanks to a bounce in bond yields following a 30-year Treasury auction that pointed to signs of soft demand for bonds, pressuring prices, which trade inversely to yields.
“The auction results suggest some discomfort with 30-year yields below 2% and the heavier than average Dealer takedown suggests that there will be more bonds for sale post-auction than usual,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Ahead of the auction U.S. bond yields were on the back foot earlier as investors shrugged off another upside surprise in inflation as transitory.
“The largest year-over-year increase in the headline and core CPI since 2009 and 1991, respectively, much of the uptick in costs continues to reflect a reopening of the economy  apparel, autos, and travel – accounting for the majority of rise,” Stifel said.
The move higher in inflation could be sustained by the reopening of economies globally once the delta coronavirus variant peaks and global vaccinations gather pace. 
“There have been a few fits and starts with what's gone on in Japan with the Delta variant of COVID, but I think that the reopening is real on a global basis, and it should lead to inflation going forward,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its full-year outlook after delivering earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations amid strong quarter of growth from its North American beverage business. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell more than 4% after unveiling a new manufacturing quality flaw in its 737 Dreamliners.    
The sudden move higher in yields, meanwhile, reined in some bullish bets on growth, though gains in Microsoft and Apple kept the downside in check.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded mixed.
But higher valuations in tech could keep a lid on demand for the sector, particularly against a backdrop of somewhat cheaper cyclicals stocks, which tend to perform well during the early stages of a recovery relative to growth.
“In the early stages of a recovery, value stocks tend to do better,” according to Schuringa. ""I think that investors looking to de-risk their portfolio and equity exposure, wouldn’t mind taking some of their tech gains off the table. Hopefully, by investing in companies that haven't had the same run higher [as tech has], investors can lower their downside risk in the portfolio versus increasing it by either holding their positions or adding to them to protect.""
The weak end to the day comes ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's two-day mandated semiannual testimony on the state of monetary policy. Powell is expected to comment on the strong reopening, though will likely continue to suggest that inflation remains transitory.
""Chair Powell likely will acknowledge the unexpectedly big reopening spike in his Testimony tomorrow, but he won’t be re-writing it. Patience will remain the watchword,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note. "

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. life sciences company Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s proposed buy of cancer test maker Grail Inc faces a lengthy EU antitrust investigation if it does not offer hefty concessions this week, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Illumina announced the $8 billion cash-and-stock deal for cancer screening startup Grail last September under which it will buy out investors, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, to regain control of a company it spun out five years ago.
Last month, the European Commission opened a preliminary review into the deal, a decision Illumina is challenging in court because the deal does not meet the EU revenue criteria. It eventually decided to seek EU approval for the deal while waiting for the court ruling.
The EU competition enforcer's review ends on July 22. According to EU merger rules, Illumina has until July 15 to offer concessions to address possible competition concerns or risk a five-month regulatory investigation.
Illumina has informally proposed concessions similar to the ones it offered the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which includes contractual guarantees of equal and fair access to its sequencing and a commitment to drive down prices by more than 40 percent by 2025, the people said.
The EU antitrust watchdog however does not think the offer is enough, they said.

The Commission declined to comment. Illumina did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its stock fell 1% and was down 0.3% in early trade after the Reuters story went out.
The EU regulator in April said the combined entity could restrict access to, or increase prices of next-generation sequencers and reagents to the detriment of Grail rivals in genomic cancer tests.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 03:52PM ET</span>",Do more: UK's Johnson calls on firms to tackle internet's 'dark spaces',"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned to tell social media companies in a meeting on Tuesday to do more to tackle online abuse, condemning racist comments made against England soccer players as coming from ""the dark spaces of the internet"".
Johnson's government has come under fire by some players and commentators, who say the Conservative prime minister and some of his top team have fanned the flames of prejudice in ways that encouraged online abuse of three Black players on the team.
But Johnson's spokesman said the prime minister had urged people to support the team and not boo them for taking the knee - a protest first made by American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick and followed by the Black Lives Matter movement.
""He said the abuse was utterly disgraceful and had emerged from the dark spaces of the internet,"" the spokesman said, describing an earlier meeting between Johnson and his cabinet team of top ministers.
""He said he would use today's meeting with social media firms to reiterate the urgent need for action ahead of tougher laws coming into force through the online harms bill,"" the spokesman told journalists.
Some England fans booed the taking-the-knee gesture, with critics viewing it as a politicisation of sport and expression of sympathy with far-left politics; interior minister Priti Patel rejected it as ""gesture politics"".
Some government ministers have drawn accusations from the football world and opposition leaders of hypocrisy for refusing to criticise those who booed and using it as part of a wider ""culture war"" - a rift between those wanting to protect Britain's heritage from a ""woke"" youth, who see their elders as blocking moves to end racial and social injustice.
ABUSE
After England's loss to Italy in the Euros final match on Sunday, Marcus Rashford, 23, Jadon Sancho, 21, and Bukayo Saka, 19, were the targets of abuse after they missed spot-kicks in a penalty shootout.
The government condemned the abuse but looked set to try to turn attention to social media companies, which have long been pressed by campaigners to better regulate what is published on their sites. 
""We expect social media companies to do everything they can to identify these people,"" Johnson's spokesman said.
Later, after Tuesday's meeting, Twitter said: ""There is always more to do and we are committed to working together with the government, industry partners and civil society in building a safer internet for all."" 
The issue of online abuse of players led to British soccer authorities briefly boycotting social media platforms before the European tournament, while Britain is planning legislation to force tech firms to do more.
But amidst the abuse, there has been an outpouring of support for the three targeted players. 
England soccer fans stepped up to defend Rashford by covering the racist abuse scrawled on a mural to the Black player in his hometown with messages of love and support for a ""hero"" who they said was a national role model.
Gary Neville, a former England team star and now TV football pundit, said Johnson and some in his government had made remarks that effectively promoted racist behaviour and division.

“When we get racist abuse after a football match at the end of a tournament, I expect it, unfortunately, because it exists, and it’s actually promoted by the prime minister, who called (burka-clad) Muslim women letterboxes, said they look like letterboxes...,"" Neville said, referring to a 2018 newspaper column by Johnson when he was a lawmaker. 
""The prime minister said it was OK for the population of this country to boo those players who were trying to promote equality and defend against racism. It starts at the very top.”

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) has been freeing up about $5 billion of capital that management can use for share buybacks, dividends and business investments, after selling stakes in companies and real estate holdings as valuations soared, management said on Tuesday.
Some companies Goldman has invested in, like payments firm Marqeta, have recently pursued traditional IPOs, while others like cryptocurrency operator Circle and renewable energy firm ReNew Power have struck deals to go public through SPAC mergers. 
Altogether, that has led to gains on initial investments as well as capital relief, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said while discussing second-quarter results. 
Other investments on Goldman’s balance sheet have gained value as well. All told, the bank expects prior and future exits to produce about $5 billion worth of capital under a regulatory stress test that determines how big U.S. banks can use their balance sheets. “We are actively executing on our harvesting strategy,” Scherr said.
Goldman has been a savvy investor with its own capital for decades, but rules imposed since the 2008 financial crisis have forced the bank to change the way it does business.
Investments Goldman once pursued for pure profit have been diminished by several regulations imposed since then, including the Volcker rule, Federal Reserve stress tests known as CCAR and capital standards known as Basel 3.
Goldman has benefited from a recent upswing in capital markets activity, particularly with a flood of M&A activity through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
The bank has already sold off assets that offer $4 billion worth of capital to use for other purposes, Scherr said. Management sees a clear path to free up another $1 billion worth of capital in the near future, Scherr said.

These bets can be risky and do not always work out, which is why the Fed tries to limit major U.S. banks from engaging in equity investments from their balance sheets.
For instance, Goldman booked heavy losses in 2019 from an investment in troubled office-sharing firm WeWork and sold its stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) after a big markdown in valuation.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Universal Hydrogen in zero-carbon plane deals with Icelandair, others","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Universal Hydrogen, a U.S. firm that aims to do for clean fuel what Nespresso did for coffee, is poised to announce preliminary hydrogen deals with airlines including Icelandair as it looks at a possible listing as early as next year.
Europe's Airbus has captured attention with a pledge to introduce 100-seat hydrogen-powered airliners by 2035.
But founded by former Airbus technology chief Paul Eremenko, Universal Hydrogen aims to speed up the introduction of hydrogen for smaller regional airplanes to 2025 by using fuel cells fed by modular hydrogen capsules to replace their turboprop systems.
""It is a $2.5 billion market on a regional scale,"" Eremenko estimated in an interview. 
Universal Hydrogen is one of a cluster of companies flocking to efforts to decarbonise aviation and says it is trying to solve a crucial problem with the clean but highly flammable fuel: how to connect production to airports where it is needed.
""We are the Nespresso capsule of hydrogen. We don't grow the coffee and we don't make the coffee-maker,"" Eremenko told Reuters, referring to the Nestle division whose capsules revolutionised premium coffee-drinking habits.
In order to kickstart demand, Nespresso offered coffee makers while encouraging others to build compatible machines.
""It is a similar model for us ... Somebody has to build the first coffee maker and our version of that is to develop a conversion kit and offer that to regional airlines,"" he said.
The kits include a fuel cell and electric powertrain to replace conventional turboprops built by Pratt & Whitney Canada. Airlines' cost of investing in the kits can be offset against long-term contracts to supply fuel via modular capsules.
From the viewpoint of a passenger, the propellers remain while the engine architecture and fuel system behind them change, with some seats removed to fit the hydrogen capsules.
Under the tentative deals to be announced on Wednesday, details of which have been supplied to Reuters, Spanish regional airline Air Nostrum would buy 11 kits to convert current and future ATR 72-600 turboprop airplanes.
Ravn Alaska, which last year inherited part of the operations of bankrupt Alaskan regional carrier RavnAir, would buy five conversion kits under a long-term hydrogen fuel deal.
Icelandair would also buy conversion kits for its regional fleet as part of a long-term fuel supply deal.
COST CHALLENGE
Both Ravn and Icelandair operate De Havilland Canada DHC-8 turboprops, more widely known as Dash 8. Universal Hydrogen's kits can convert power systems used on Dash 8s or ATRs.
Not everyone is confident hydrogen will quickly solve the sector's environmental challenges despite zero carbon emissions.
A European Union climate masterplan due on Wednesday is expected to include ambitious targets for alternative aviation fuels made from sources like waste. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has focused more on such sustainable fuels than hydrogen.
Hurdles to be solved include cost and availability as well as uncertainty over how hydrogen systems will be certified.
""At the moment hydrogen is more expensive. We believe that in the future when hydrogen is more available it will become closer to being competitive,"" Icelandair Chief Operating Officer Jens Thordarson told Reuters, adding governments should also provide support for the zero-emission fuel.
""There is a good opportunity for Iceland to be an early adopter of these kinds of technologies,"" he added. 
Iceland has plentiful renewable energy to create so-called green hydrogen without relying on fossil fuels in production.
Universal Hydrogen also plans to launch a design study with Deutsche Aircraft aimed at incorporating its capsules into a new version of the out-of-production Dornier 328 regional turboprop.
The same German company last week announced a partnership with H2FLY, a fuel-cell developer based in Germany, with a view to demonstrating a hydrogen-powered Dornier 328 by 2025.
Backed by investors including venture capital arms of Airbus, Toyota and JetBlue, Universal Hydrogen recently raised funds and is now exploring interim 'Series B' financing as it ramps up industrially.

Beyond this, it has its eye on joining a wave of listings via special acquisition vehicles or SPACs, ""depending on how the SPAC market evolves over the next year or so,"" Eremenko said.
""Hydrogen is the 100% decarbonisation solution and there is a willingness and need to start talking about such measures"".

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Tuesday it will cut 787 production after finding another production-related structural defect, and a major customer partially canceled a 737 MAX order, in a double hit to the U.S. planemaker's COVID-19 pandemic recovery.
Chicago-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) now forecasts delivering fewer than half of the lingering 100 or so 787 Dreamliners in its inventory this year - instead of the ""vast majority"" it had expected - as it continues forensic inspections and costly repairs to address quality flaws in the aircraft. 
Boeing did not disclose a new production rate for the 787 program, but said it would shift temporarily below the already-slow current rate of five jets per month.
""To us this is more significant than the cut to the delivery forecast, as it ripples down through the supply chain,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a client note.
""The supply chain cannot just be turned on and off like a switch,"" Stallard added. 
Separately, United Arab Emirates airline flydubai said on Tuesday it has agreed with Boeing to cut the number of 737 MAX aircraft it will take delivery of by 65. The airline has already taken delivery of 16 MAX jets out of its total order of 251, according to Boeing's website. 
Boeing shares were down 3.3% in afternoon trading against a fractionally lower Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
For the year so far, the company has delivered 156 jets of all types, compared with 157 for all of 2020, Boeing said. 
The latest production-related flaw, first reported by Reuters on Monday, involved unacceptable gaps around the forward pressure bulkhead, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said. 
The FAA said late on Monday that Boeing, which spotted the problem, would fix it before the planes are delivered.
The U.S. planemaker's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical defects and other issues since late last year. Boeing halted deliveries of the jet in May, the second pause after it initially stopped handing over the jet in late 2020.
""We will continue to take the necessary time to ensure Boeing airplanes meet the highest quality prior to delivery,"" Boeing said, adding that the new issue poses no immediate threat to flight safety.
The FAA said it will review data to ""determine whether similar modifications should be made on 787s already in commercial service.""
In June, Boeing booked 146 jet orders. That net figure takes into account instances in which the buyer converted an order to another model or canceled it entirely, including 71 737 MAX jets, the company said.
Its backlog increased from 4,121 to 4,166 aircraft, Boeing said. 
Boeing handed over 45 planes to customers in June, its highest monthly total since March 2019, when the second of two fatal 737 MAX crashes occurred.

Its June delivery tally includes 10 widebody aircraft, one of which was a 787-9 for Turkish Airlines, Boeing said. 
It also delivered 35 737s, including 33 737 MAXs and two P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to the U.S. Navy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal jury convicted the former chief of a Chicago bank on charges he approved millions of dollars of risky loans to Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, in an effort to gain a top post in the Trump administration.
Stephen Calk, former chairman and chief executive of Federal Savings Bank, was convicted on Tuesday of financial institution bribery and conspiracy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan confirmed.
Prosecutors had said Calk helped arrange $16 million of loans to Manafort that later went into default.
""We are very disappointed by the verdict and will be pursuing all available legal remedies, including an appeal,"" a lawyer for Calk said in a statement. Calk had pleaded not guilty. 
Prosecutors alleged Manafort recommended to Trump's post-election transition team that Calk, a 16-year Army veteran, be appointed Army secretary, the service's top civilian job.
Calk interviewed in January 2017 for a job as under secretary of the Army but never joined the administration.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement: ""Calk used the federally-insured bank he ran as his personal piggybank to try and buy himself prestige and power. Today’s verdict sends the message that corruption at the highest levels of federally regulated financial institutions will be prosecuted by this Office.""

Calk is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 10, 2022.
Manafort was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud and sentenced to 7-1/2 years in prison, but was later released to home confinement. Trump then pardoned Manafort in December.

896,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Treasury Yield Curve Resumes Steepening After Weak Bond Auction,"(Bloomberg) -- The Treasury yield curve was subject to notable volatility Tuesday. Weak demand for the monthly 30-year bond auction unleashed a bout of steepening that reversed a flattening move spurred by hot June inflation readings.
As the consumer price index data emboldened traders to bet that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy in early 2023, spurring five-year yields higher, the gap with 30-year yields narrowed to less than 114 basis points, approaching the slimmest levels of 2021, reached last month. After the auction, it widened back toward 120 basis points, remaining well below an over six-year high of 167 basis points reached in February.
Five-year yields rose as high as 0.852%, up more than 20 basis points from mid-February levels. Money-market traders are penciling in Fed liftoff from near zero in early 2023 -- with implied rates on the contracts rising slightly Tuesday. Bond yields, by and large lower on the day after the inflation data, took off after the auction, approaching 2.05%, the highest level in a week.
Consumer price readings surged last month by the most since 2008. That helped lift bond-market gauges of future price pressures. The 10-year breakeven rate, a market proxy for the average annual inflation rate over the next decade, rose as high as 2.37%, although it remains below an eight-year high reached in May. It ebbed from those highs after policy makers last month brought forward their median forecast for when they’d first lift rates, to 2023.
The CPI data “will give ammunition to those FOMC participants who prefer to raise rates sooner rather than later (i.e., in 2022) and correspondingly will make the arguments of those who prefer to wait (including the leadership) more complicated,” Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC, wrote in a note with colleague Benson Durham. It’s also “a further yield curve flattener. The hurdle for a re-steepening of the curve is high.”
Fed officials foresee two hikes by the end of 2023, according to the median estimate of their projections published last month. Yet Boston President Fed Eric Rosengren as well as St. Louis Fed’s James Bullard, Dallas’s Robert Kaplan and Atlanta President Raphael Bostic have all publically laid out a scenario in which the central bank would lift rates next year.
Rates on the long bond were down as much as about 4 basis points at 1.95%, before rebounding to be higher on the day at about 2% after the auction was completed.
Treasury’s $24 billion reopening of 30-year debt was sold at 2%, more than 2 basis points above where the debt was trading on a when-issued basis just before bidding completed. It was still the lowest 30-year auction yield since February. Today’s sale follows solid 3- and 10-year auctions on Monday.
A swath of Wall Street forecasters have been flatting this month that the multi-year curve steepening trend is over.
“The inflation genie could be out of the bottle as the inflation picture looks less and less transitory,” Sung Won Sohn, president of SS Economics and a professor at Loyola Marymount University wrote in a note. “To be sure, the supply bottlenecks, a surge in demand and the base effect explain some of the increases, but it is difficult to argue that everything will be back to normal in a few months.”

897,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Small-Caps Lose Year’s Edge Over Tech With Bearish Bets Rising,"(Bloomberg) -- Count small-cap stocks among the casualties of the quickly unraveling reflation trade.
The Russell 2000 Index fell more than 1% on Tuesday as the fastest inflation since 2008 fueled concern over pricing pressures and the growth potential of smaller U.S. companies. The retreat contrasts with a gain in the Nasdaq 100, where technology megacaps are increasingly favored for their strong earnings potential.
Poised to trail the Nasdaq 100 for a second month in a row, the Russell 2000 has now wiped out its year-to-date outperformance, which at one point reached 19 percentage points against the tech-heavy gauge. At the same time, short sellers are circling back. Bearish wagers against the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM) are now at the highest level since October, according to data compiled by IHS Markit.
“This is a big reversal, but part of a regime change,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Investors got comfortable with a narrative that small-caps and cyclicals would ride into the sunset this year in a grand recovery trade. But that story faded when interest rates collapsed and tech earnings grew white hot.”
To some, it’s a part of a marketwide unwinding of the cyclical trade that got a big boost after November’s rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. Back then, the Russell 2000 beat the Nasdaq 100 six months in a row, with gains running six times as large.
Now, the delta variant of the coronavirus is quickly spreading. And the pickup in inflation is stoking concerns that small companies won’t be able to pass rising costs on to customers while the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
“There’s been a reversal where growth has outperformed again and part of that is because it looks like future growth will not be as great, and so the cyclical play seems to be playing out a bit,” said Stephen Dover (NYSE:DOV), chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Investment Institute. “Technology companies tend to have more pricing power than the cyclical companies at this point and are likely to have more pricing power in the future.”
Small-caps are left behind in an advance that has continued to push other major indexes like the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 to new highs. The Russell 2000 last scored an all-time high in March and has yet to break out.
The lagging returns have led to a discount to large-caps. Based on its price to forward-earnings ratio, the Russell 2000 traded at a multiple that’s 0.82 times the Russell 1000’s, data compiled by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). show. Historically, small-caps tended to fetch a 3% premium.
Despite attractive valuations, bears are doubling down on bets against small-caps. After falling to a two-year low of roughly 4% in March, short interest on the iShares ETF tracking the Russell 2000 has risen to 11% of its outstanding shares, according to IHS Markit’s data.
Even so, Jeff Schulze, a strategist at ClearBridge Investments, isn’t ready to give up on small-caps just yet. He sees economic activity remaining elevated in the second half of this year amid excess savings and a potential spike in business spending.
“All of this creates a situation where you have strong economic activity and you have very robust earnings growth, which tends to favor value and small cap,” Schulze said. “As you see 10-year Treasuries bottom here and start to move higher; I think that’s going to be the catalyst for small-cap outperformance once again.”

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. SEC focuses on bank fee conflicts as it steps-up SPAC inquiry -sources,"(Corrects RICs for Citi,  Credit Suisse )
By Anirban Sen and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has ramped-up its inquiry on Wall Street's blank check acquisition frenzy, homing in on potential conflicts of interest created when banks act as underwriters and advisers on the same deal, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring whether certain fee structures may incentivise underwriters on special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, listings to secure unsuitable deals when also advising on the later stage merger, potentially putting investors at risk, the people said.
Banks that have received SEC requests for information include top SPAC underwriters  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Credit Suisse Group (S:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), they said.
Spokespeople for the banks declined to comment. 
SPACs are listed shell companies used to take private companies public, sidestepping the more traditional and lengthy initial public offering (IPO) process.
Reuters reported in March that the SEC's enforcement division had opened an inquiry on Wall Street banks' SPAC dealings, sending letters to several institutions seeking information on deal risks and internal controls. 
Since March, the SEC has focused its inquiry on a group of banks, law firms and SPAC sponsors involved in troubled deals and has sought more information about the deals and interviewed executives concerned, according to two of the three sources. 
The SEC is particularly interested in the fees banks have earned when playing several roles on a deal, all three sources said. They declined to say which deals were under scrutiny.
""The big issue for the SEC is to understand if the advisers are conflicted,"" said one of the people.
A spokesperson for the SEC did not respond to requests for comment. 
SPAC sponsors typically pay banks a 5.5% fee for underwriting the IPO, part of which is paid up front, with the rest paid upon completion of the merger. 
Underwriting banks can earn more fees if they also go on to represent the merger target and help the SPAC sponsor raise additional cash from private investors to finance the takeover. 
The SEC is examining potential conflicts in such situations when a bank works for both sides of the transaction and stands to earn a chunk of fees when the merger goes through. 
Critics say such arrangements could incentivise banks to talk up targets or play down potential problems, which could harm investors if the target company's earnings underperform, or other regulatory or legal issues emerge following the merger. 
SPAC returns have trailed the S&P 500 and some SPACs have been accused by shareholders and government investigators of misleading disclosures..
The sources declined to be named because the discussions are private. Regulatory requests for information do not necessarily imply wrongdoing. 
EXTRA DILIGENCE
Under the rules, lawyers and accountants are required to disclose their fees in the SPAC's regulatory filings, but banks are not. In its recent inquiries, the SEC has asked banks for more information on their payouts, the three sources said. 
The SEC has also asked the banks for information on the due diligence they performed on SPAC mergers, including when reviewing revenue growth projections and other disclosures made by the target companies, one of the sources said.
The increased scrutiny has prompted some banks to review their processes and increase due diligence, the third source said, adding that some banks and sponsors were also more frequently separating the underwriting and advisory roles.

SPACs have existed for decades, but over the past 18 months the deal structure has been popularized by high-profile sponsors and boosted by easy monetary conditions.
A record nearly $100 billion was raised by U.S. SPACs in the first quarter of 2021, according to Dealogic, before dealmaking flagged amid market saturation and heightened SEC scrutiny.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 01:46PM ET</span>","After COVID revenue collapse, Canadian municipalities face insurance premium spike","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) -Canadian municipalities reeling from a pandemic-driven hit to revenues are facing an added blow from surging liability insurance costs, forcing them to raise property taxes or even cut services for residents. 
The increase in premiums, about 20% to 30% in many cases, has been driven by a shrinking pool of insurers, more claims in an increasingly litigious climate and uncertainty around payout amounts. 
Cities need insurance to protect against claims in the event of accidents on municipal properties or roads, and to deal with risks including cyber attacks and natural disasters - so forgoing coverage is not an option. 
The 444 municipalities in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, would face a combined revenue shortfall of about C$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion) due to the pandemic, Ontario's Financial Accountability Office (FAO) said https://www.fao-on.org/en/Blog/Publications/municipal-finances-2020#_ftn32 in December. 
""Any unanticipated increase in costs can come as a surprise,"" although municipalities do have some funds for contingencies, said Travis Shaw, senior vice-president for public finance at DBRS Morningstar.
If higher property taxes - the most reliable source of revenue at a time when other income, such as transit fees, has been decimated due to lockdowns - become unaffordable for residents, ""the other alternative is cutting expenses and reducing services,"" he said. ""They're required by law to get to a balanced budget."" 
The biggest revenue losses have been in transit, recreation and other fees, while the biggest expenses were for temporary housing and shelters and other social services, Ontario's FAO said. 
Larger cities have had the biggest hit to revenues due to transit-fee declines, but many smaller municipalities have faced big cost challenges, as many families, taking advantage of what appears to be a permanent shift to working from home, at least part-time, have fled large cities for smaller towns in search of more space and affordable housing. This has put pressure on these towns to fast-track expensive infrastructure and service projects.
SMALL POOL
While the bigger tax bases help, that benefit is ""consumed by the cost to service"" the growth, said Sandra Zwiers, director of finance for the County of Essex, about 350 kilometers southwest of downtown Toronto, which has received an influx of residents from around the city.
Essex County had a premium increase of 13%, or C$115,780, for this fiscal year, following a 10.6% rise the previous year, Zwiers said. 
Accident-related lawsuits against cities and settlements have risen alongside cyber attacks and natural disasters, both domestically and globally, even as bond yields have slid, resulting in more stringent underwriting standards and higher premiums around the world. 
While cities elsewhere, including in the United States, have also faced higher costs, there has been an outsized impact on Canadian municipalities due to a small pool of insurers, smaller populations and the legal requirement for municipalities to have joint and several liability (J&S) coverage, according to DBRS Morningstar.
J&S covers the share of settlement amounts other at-fault parties are responsible for when they cannot pay them, so that the plaintiff is not short-changed. 
Alongside rising premiums, some towns face higher deductibles, and the removal of some coverage, including environmental impairment and cyber. Essex County's deductible rose to C$100,000 per occurrence last year, from C$25,000 previously.
For Bracebridge, a town in the cottage district of Muskoka, some 175 kilometers north of Toronto, a C$160,000 increase in expenses in a year raises property taxes by 1%, said its mayor, Graydon Smith, who is also president of the Association of Municipalities Ontario. 
""The frustration comes from the fact that we could (manage risks) as well as anybody can do, but that still doesn't stop the 30% increase"" Bracebridge has seen this year, Smith said. What may be deemed inadequate risk management, meanwhile, could result in bigger hikes, he added.
Municipalities in insurance pools have controlled costs better but even they are not immune. 
Ontario's Waterloo region has an eight-municipality pool, funded by levies on members, with settlements split between the city at fault, the pool and the excess insurance provider.
Despite being considered lower-risk than other cities, premiums in Waterloo rose a ""modest"" 9.8% last year, and a ""significant"" increase is expected this year, said Brian McEnhill, risk manager for the insurance pool.
McEnhill attributed the increases partly to more claims - particularly higher-valued ones that have the region relying more on its insurer - and a diminishing pool of underwriters. 
EXITING INSURERS 
Consolidation has shrunk the insurance market, most notably the 2019 acquisition https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guaranteeco-m-a-intact-financial-idUSKCN1V51VK of Frank Cowan Company, Canada's biggest municipal insurance provider, by Intact Financial Corp. 
An Intact spokesperson declined to comment. 
Lloyd's syndicates, including MS Amlin, as well as the Ontario Municipal Insurance Exchange (OMEX), which enabled cities to group together to self-insure, are among those who have left the Canadian municipal market in the last few years.
OMEX attributed its suspension in part to J&S.
""Underwriters only have a certain amount of premium dollars,"" said David Richards, chief executive of specialty insurance brokerage EQUA Specialty Risk Partners Corporation. ""If they're historically losing money on municipal insurance ... then capacity shrinks. As a result, they focus on where they can make money."" 
Although J&S is not unique to municipal policies, the perception of governments as deep-pocketed has driven outsized payouts, said Pete Karageorgos, consumer and industry relations director at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. 
A growing number of towns in Ontario are renewing calls to do away with J&S, but the government remains unconvinced. 
The province needs certainty that a change would mean a decline in insurance rates, and there is not enough data ""to confidently draw a causal connection,"" a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General said.
Blaming J&S is a ""red herring,"" said Ontario Trial Lawyers Association President Kris Bonn. 

""It's a more fair system to have the innocently injured victim be made whole for their losses,"" he said. ""The municipality can still go after the other defendant if they pay more than their proportionate share.""

Sales fell by 10% last year due to the fallout from the health crisis. 
The group had posted a 7% increase in sales at constant exchange rates in the first quarter, with revenues coming in just 3% above 2019 levels. 
Comparisons with the second quarter of 2020 are favourable for most retailers as it was particularly hit by the pandemic, with the bulk of shops worldwide closed.
Cucinelli is the first Italian luxury group to release second-quarter sales, and its performance adds to signs the sector has bounced back faster than initially expected.
The European market, which accounts for 43.7% of the company's total sales, including Italy, grew by 9.2% compared to the first half of 2019. Sales growth in Asia was double that. 

The company recently announced a partnership with EssilorLuxottica's brand Oliver Peoples for the launch of its first eyewear collection.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pharmacy operators Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc have agreed to pay a combined $26 million to settle claims by two New York counties that they fueled an opioid addiction epidemic.
The settlements are the first reached by pharmacies in the ongoing nationwide litigation over opioids. The pharmacies did not admit wrongdoing.
Suffolk County's legislature approved the deals on Monday, while Nassau County's legislature is expected to vote on final approval next month.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019. More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed in the United States against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies over the opioid epidemic.
Plaintiffs have accused drugmakers of falsely marketing opioids as safe, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being diverted to illegal channels. The defendants have denied the allegations.
CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis said in an email that the settlement ""reflects our position that opioid prescriptions are written by doctors, not pharmacists, and that opioid medications are made and marketed by manufacturers, not pharmacies.""
The other pharmacies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The pharmacies settled the lawsuits last month shortly before they were to go to trial, though the agreements were not publicly disclosed at the time. Trial is now underway over the counties' and New York state's claims against the remaining defendants, a group of drugmakers and distributors.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also settled before trial for $263 million. 

The funds will be used for mental health and addiction programs, representatives of the counties said.
""While these settlements cannot repair the damage done or bring back those who we lost to the grips of this epidemic, it has already made a substantial impact,"" Suffolk Legislator Rob Calarco said in a statement.

Harris, who founded Apollo along with Leon Black and Marc Rowan in 1990, will step down from his day-to-day role at the firm when its merger with annuities provider Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd closes next year, Apollo said in May.
Harris told Bloomberg through a spokesperson statement that he is ""not fundraising"", has ""no other specific plans"" and will remain focused on his work at Apollo.
The report said Harris has met with recruiting agencies to help him start building a team for the fund, which will focus on middle-market deals and is likely to have a target of $5 billion. https://bloom.bg/3yVYrYC
Apollo declined to comment on the report. 
Harris' decision to step down from Apollo came amid a series of governance changes that were triggered by Black vacating his positions at the company, after a law firm report revealed he had ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

Black was cleared of all wrongdoing, but he relinquished his chief executive officer post to Rowan, passing over Harris, who was expected to take the top job. 
Harris will remain on Apollo's board of directors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A unit of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America will pay $97 million in restitution to tens of thousands of customers who were misled into moving their retirement money into higher-fee accounts, regulators said on Tuesday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the settlement with TIAA-CREF Individual & Institutional Services, which includes a $9 million SEC civil fine.
Based in New York, TIAA ended March with $1.3 trillion of assets under management, and serves about 5 million customers including college professors, doctors and nurses, researchers and government employees.
Regulators said that from January 2012 to March 2018, TIAA advisers pressured clients to move their retirement money to higher-cost, individually-managed accounts in TIAA's Portfolio Advisor program from lower-cost, employer-sponsored plans.
Some advisers made misleading representations that they ""put the client first,"" and were trained to identify clients' ""pain points"" before recommending Portfolio Advisor as the solution to their fears about investing, regulators said.
The conflicts of interest enabled TIAA to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue, James said.
""TIAA relied on its reputation as a trusted and objective financial advisor to profit off of clients through fraudulent and manipulative sales practices,"" James said in a statement. ""We're finally making things right.""

The TIAA unit did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the settlements. It agreed to several reforms including subjecting rollover recommendations to a strict fiduciary standard, and eliminating financial incentives for selling managed accounts.
""We regret the times that we did not live up to our clients' expectations of us,"" TIAA said in a statement. ""We have learned some valuable lessons and have applied those lessons to enhancing our training, supervisory controls and disclosures.""

This should allow prominent semiconductor companies Micron (MU) and  Western Digital  (WDC) to grow in the near-term. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) are two prominent players in the storage products and solutions worldwide. MU manufactures and markets a portfolio of memory technologies for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages and other system solutions. WDC provides datacenter devices and solutions, client devices and client solutions.
Continued demand for tech devices from industries, corporations and remote workforces has helped the semiconductor industry to witness month-over-month sales growth of 4.1% in May 2021. To address the semiconductor chip shortage, the US Senate passed a bill that will allocate $52 billion to boost the domestic production of semiconductors. This, along with increasing initiatives by the governments of several other countries and enterprises to address the global chip shortage, has boosted investor optimism about the industry’s growth prospects. This is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 4% gains versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3% returns over the past month. Therefore, we think both MU and WDC are likely to benefit from their industry tailwinds.

But, while a prominent player in this space, ContextLogic (WISH), doesn’t look well positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds, fundamentally strong internet retail stocks Liquidity Services (NASDAQ:LQDT) and LightInTheBox (LITB) we think could generate handsome ROI in the near-term. So, it’s wise to scoop up their shares now. Read on.Shares of San Francisco-based mobile ecommerce company ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) have advanced 9.1% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $10.91. This performance can be attributed primarily to the Reddit crowd’s interest in the stock and investors’ optimism about its two-year partnership with France-based PrestaShop, which it announced on June 14.
However, several law firms have filed class action lawsuits against WISH, alleging violation of federal securities laws. Furthermore, WISH’s net loss has increased 93.9% year-over-year to $128 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In fact, its $0.21 loss per share for the quarter was 16.7% wider than analysts expected. Also, its EPS is expected to remain negative in its fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Also, in terms of forward EV/S and P/S, the stock’s respective 1.62x and 2.16x are higher than the 1.56x and 1.38x industry averages. So, WISH is significantly overvalued at its current price level, and we think it is wise to wait for a better entry point.
The internet retail industry, however, is expected to continue growing in the post-pandemic environment on increasing sales of smartphones and consistent innovation and improvements in 5G services, among other factors. According to an eMarketer report, the retail e-commerce sales in the United States is expected to increase 13.7% to $908.73 billion this year.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>",VW shows confidence in electric future with higher margin goal,"By Christoph Steitz
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) raised its long-term profitability target on Tuesday in a sign of the German automaker's growing confidence in managing the shift to electric and self-driving vehicles.
Presenting its strategy until 2030, Europe's largest carmaker also said it expected half of its global vehicle sales to be battery-powered by that date - joining rivals in setting ambitious goals to move on from the era of combustion engines.
The targets come ahead of a huge package of climate policies the European Union plans to announce on Wednesday, possibly including a de facto ban of petrol-based vehicles from 2035.
At Volkswagen, which aims to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker by 2025, battery EVs accounted for just 3% of global sales last year.
""We set ourselves a strategic target to become global market leader in electric vehicles - and we are well on track. Now we are setting parameters,"" said Chief Executive Herbert Diess, whose contract was extended last week until 2025.
After reporting blow-out first-half earnings, Volkswagen said it expected the strong performance of its existing business to help fund 150 billion euros ($178 billion) of investments by 2025 in areas such as batteries and software.
It added the synergies between technologies and brands, which span budget Seats and Skodas to upmarket Audis and Porsches, also gave it the confidence to increase its target for operating return on sales for 2025 to 8-9% from 7-8%.
SCALE AND STRENGTH
""We view the combination of scale and financial strength as unrivalled,"" said Marc Decker, head of fund management at Merck Finck. ""Against this backdrop it's just a matter of time until the Wolfsburg-based company will become the world leader in the market for electric mobility.""
Volkswagen fleshed out plans to build six large battery factories in Europe by 2030, choosing China's Gotion High-Tech as a partner for its planned Salzgitter factory in Germany and looking at Spain as a location for another plant.
The plans mark the latest step by the world's second-largest carmaker after Toyota to reinvent itself following a 2015 scandal over rigged emissions tests for diesel engines that has so far cost it more than 32 billion euros.
Announced via trailers and management tweets last week, the strategy day tried to recreate the success of Volkswagen's Power Day in March, which caused its shares to surge and briefly made it Germany's most valuable firm.
While still up 42% year-to-date, the shares have dropped 14% from their March highs, reflecting the challenge to convince investors that fat profits from combustion engine cars can be replaced with those from EVs.
Carmakers have set an array of goals for an electric future. Last week, Stellantis said it was aiming for more than 70% of sales in Europe and over 40% in the United States to be low-emission vehicles by 2030. That includes hybrid vehicles, as well as all-electric battery cars.

Volkswagen said last month it would stop selling gas-guzzlers in Europe by 2035 and somewhat later in China and the United States as part of its shift towards EVs.

The shift towards clean energy solutions is inevitable and should gain significant momentum in the upcoming decade making EV stocks interesting investments right now.

916,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 11:31AM ET</span>",Why is Silver Not Rallying Despite Hot Inflation Data?,"Silver (SLV) has underperformed in 2021 and failed to rally despite hot inflation readings. Taylor Dart breaks down what's really happening and why the bullish trend remains intact.It’s been a frustrating start to the year for investors in the precious metals complex, with investors getting what they were hoping for from inflation figures but not seeing any positive reaction from metals prices. This is despite inflation hitting a 13-year high for June at 5.20%, pushing real rates further into negative territory to a reading of (-) 5.30%. Typically, this backdrop is good for metals prices and makes for the best time to be holding silver (SLV) and miners, with previous periods being 2004-2009 and 1974-1980. Not surprisingly, this disconnect is turning many former bulls into bears and making many second-guess their position in the trade. The good news is that the technical charts suggest little reason to be cautious, with their most bullish setup in place in more than a decade. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TradingView.com)
If we look at the chart above, we can see that the 1980-2005 period was a lost quarter-century for silver bulls, with the price spending a decade in a bear market before spending nearly 15 years going sideways. This complete reset in the market following the parabolic bull market that ended in 1980 created the conditions for a massive bull market from 2005-2011, with the silver price soaring by more than 500%, from $7.00/oz to above $40.00/oz. Since the parabolic 2011 peak, we’ve seen a similar setup, albeit on a shorter time frame, with silver spending 2012-2016 in a bear market, 2016-2019 going sideways, and the metal finally breaking out of its range in 2020. Since then, we’ve seen very volatile trading with little upside progress since the July 2020 breakout, causing many investors to throw in the towel on the trade. However, on closer inspection, silver did this exact same thing nearly twenty years ago, breaking out in 2004 before spending nearly two years going nowhere in a volatile sideways range.

CRTD’s shares are up 26.5% over the past three months and 44.9% over the past month. However, the stock has lost 61.3% over the past year.
Although substantial growth in its creator subscription base since the launch of the company’s flagship Vocal+ platform in early 2020 has bolstered its revenue growth, the company has not been able to generate any profit in the past 12 months. CRTD’s stock is currently trading 28.6% below its 52-week high of $7.81.
The company’s current valuation is not justified by its staggering losses and rising expenses. Also, expected pressure on tech stocks because President Biden has signed a new executive order to crack down on anti-competitive practices in big tech, along with CRTD’s weak profitability, could cause the stock’s price to pullback.

COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the pandemic started last year are fueling demand for everything from cars to restaurant meals, straining the supply chain, creating labor shortages and raising prices https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumer-prices-surge-june-124525292.html across the economy.
U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. 
""As the fourth quarter unfolded, input cost inflation accelerated and we now expect fiscal 2022 input cost inflation to be materially higher than we anticipated at the end of fiscal Q3,"" Conagra's Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said in a fourth-quarter statement, which showed that profit missed expectations. 
Ingredient and packaging costs represent 60% to 65% of total cost basket of Duncan Hines cake mixes and Marie Callender's frozen meals maker. 
""We anticipated that cost inflation would be an issue this coming fiscal year, but it was even higher than we expected,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 
Conagra shares fell 4.3% in morning trade, even after it announced a 14% hike in its annual dividend.
The company now expects adjusted operating margins to be about 16% for its fiscal year ending May 2022, compared with the 18% to 19% it expected earlier. 

While Conagra, like peers Unilever (NYSE:UL) and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), has been raising prices to offset inflation, it said it would have to be ""aggressive"" going forward.
However, it anticipates a lag between the time the company is hit with higher costs and when it realizes the benefits of its pricing actions. This lag is expected to be felt the most in the first quarter.

A recent report by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) stated that the company violated several laws and regulations in relation to users’ personal information. The report was primarily responsible for the shares’ decline.
Furthermore, China's cyberspace regulators have been imposing tighter restrictions on data collection and data storage, and tightening rules for companies listed overseas or seeking to sell shares abroad, which is expected to continue affecting DIDI, among other China-based companies. In addition, the company has reported losses over the last three years. So, we think DIDI’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

(Reuters) -PepsiCo Inc will increase the prices of its products this year, the company said on Tuesday after it raised its full-year earnings forecast on surging demand for its sodas from pandemic-weary people flocking to restaurants and theaters. 
A host of factors, including disruptions in global supply chains and rising demand, has pushed up raw-material prices, forcing packaged food companies such as PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co to pass on costs to consumers.
The inflationary trend was underscored by the latest set of data, which showed U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June. 
PepsiCo's move to raise prices, likely after Labor Day, will also be used to offset higher advertising and marketing costs, which rose 30% in the quarter as the company looked to take advantage of a reopening U.S. economy, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters.
Net revenue from beverage sales to schools, restaurants, stadiums and other such businesses in North America doubled in the second quarter.
""Performance in the food service channels was very sudden after three quarters of negative growth,"" Johnston said.
""It opened up very rapidly and there was a lot of desire for people to get out as they got vaccinated."" 
Overall net revenue rose 20.5% to $19.22 billion in the quarter ended June 12, above expectations of $17.96 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Excluding items, PepsiCo earned $1.72 per share, above estimates of $1.53 per shares.
The company expects fiscal 2021 core earnings per share to increase 11%, compared with prior forecast of a high-single-digit increase. 
PepsiCo said it would also expand an automation program to its manufacturing plants, warehouses and service centers, resulting in expected pre-tax charges of about $3.15 billion.

Johnston said potential job losses due to automation will be more than offset by employment growth in other parts of the company.
 Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) shares rose about 2.5% to hit a record high in early trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The negative impact of currency fluctuations on North American companies' results increased in the first quarter to the highest level since the second quarter of 2020, data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba showed on Tuesday.
The collective exchange rate impact, including on companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was $5.87 billion in the first quarter, compared with a $1.39 billion negative effect in the fourth quarter of 2020, Kyriba said in a report. It was the most since a $14.16 billion impact in the second quarter of last year.
S&P 500 companies are just beginning to report earnings for the second quarter of 2021. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) both reported results earlier on Tuesday.
The rise in total currency impacts is ""a break in the low trend"" from the last two quarters, and is potentially due to the continued volatility of the U.S. dollar, Kyriba said in its report.
""As businesses experience a post-pandemic surge in activity, CFOs were unable to keep up with currency movements, unnecessarily risking corporate liquidity,"" Kyriba's Wolfgang Koester said in a statement.
Kyriba said 77 North American companies reported currency impacts in the first quarter, compared with 28 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 69 in the third quarter of 2020.
The U.S. dollar index rose 3.6% in the first quarter of this year but has weakened since then. It lost 0.9% in the second quarter.

On Monday, the dollar climbed across the board as concerns about the coronavirus pandemic encouraged investors to seek safe havens.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Switzerland's markets watchdog FINMA on Tuesday named Zurich Insurance chief investment officer Urban Angehrn as its new boss, tapping an insurance industry veteran to lead the financial supervisor.
Angehrn will take charge at the Swiss markets authority as it scrutinises risk controls at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) following financial debacles at the country's second-biggest bank that led to billions of francs in losses.
FINMA is also stepping up pressure on banks and insurers, including Zurich Insurance, to disclose climate risks to their businesses.
Angehrn, 56, with a Harvard University doctorate in mathematics, spent 14 years at Zurich after jobs at Winterthur Group, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan.
He succeeds Mark Branson, who was named president of the German finance regulator BaFin in March.
""FINMA is gaining an experienced leader with broad national and international financial market experience in the insurance, banking and asset management industries,"" Marlene Amstad, Chair of FINMA’s Board of Directors, said in a statement. 
With its appointment of Angehrn, FINMA has again turned to Switzerland's domestic financial industry for a leader. Branson, a former manager at Swiss bank UBS, was elevated to FINMA's top job in 2014 after leading its oversight of banks and holding a deputy CEO role.
Jan Bloechliger will remain as interim CEO until Angehrn takes over on Nov. 1, FINMA said.
Angehrn's appointment, approved by the Swiss government, puts him in charge of a supervisory body, not a regulator, as Swiss law - designed largely to shield banks - does not allow FINMA to impose fines, though it can claw back profits from any illicit activity. 

FINMA has a code of conduct mandating that Angehrn recuse himself from participating in supervisory decisions over Zurich Insurance in the year after he starts work. 
Zurich CEO Mario Greco, who lauded Angehrn's management of the insurer's investments in a separate statement, named Peter Giger, currently Zurich's group chief risk officer, as interim CIO until a permanent replacement is found.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>",France fines Google 500 million euros over copyright row,"PARIS (Reuters) -France's antitrust watchdog slapped a 500 million euro ($593 million) fine on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google on Tuesday for failing to comply with the regulator's orders on how to conduct talks with the country's news publishers in a row over copyright.
The fine comes amid increasing international pressure on online platforms such as Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to share more revenue with news outlets.
The U.S. tech group must now come up with proposals within the next two months on how it would compensate news agencies and other publishers for the use of their news. If it does not do that, the company would face additional fines of up to 900,000 euros per day.
Google said it was very disappointed with the decision but would comply.
""Our objective remains the same: we want to turn the page with a definitive agreement. We will take the French Competition Authority's feedback into consideration and adapt our offers,"" the U.S. tech giant said.
A Google spokesperson added: ""We have acted in good faith throughout the entire process. The fine ignores our efforts to reach an agreement, and the reality of how news works on our platforms.""
News publishers APIG, SEPM and AFP accuse the tech company of having failed to hold talks in good faith with them to find common ground for the remuneration of news content online, under a recent European Union directive that creates so-called ""neighbouring rights"". 
The case itself focused on whether Google breached temporary orders issued by the antitrust authority, which demanded such talks take place within three months with any news publishers that ask for them.
""When the authority decrees an obligation for a company, it must comply scrupulously, both in the spirit and letter (of the decision). Here, this was unfortunately not the case,"" the antitrust body's chief, Isabelle de Silva, said in a statement. She also said the regulator considered that Google had not acted in good faith in its negotiations with the publishers. 
APIG, which represents most major French print news publishers including Le Figaro and Le Monde, remains one of the plaintiffs, even though it signed a framework agreement with Google earlier this year, sources have told Reuters. This framework deal has been put on hold pending the antitrust decision, the sources said.
The framework agreement, which many other French media outlets criticised, was one of the highest-profile deals under Google's ""News Showcase"" programme to provide compensation for news snippets used in search results, and the first of its kind in Europe.

Google agreed to pay $76 million over three years to a group of 121 French news publishers to end the copyright row, documents seen by Reuters showed. 
It followed months of bargaining between Google, French publishers and news agencies over how to apply the revamped EU copyright rules, which allow publishers to demand a fee from online platforms showing extracts of their news.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened moderately lower on Tuesday but were comfortably off the premarket lows that they hit in response another set of stronger-than-expected inflation data.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44 points, or 0.1%, at 34,842 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down less than 0.1%.
The annual rate of consumer inflation rose to 5.4% in June, defying expectations for a decline to 4.9%. The monthly rises in both the consumer price index and its narrower, ‘core’ definition also both outstripped expectations.
The data revived fears that the Federal Reserve will soon start to withdraw the monetary stimulus that has driven the rally of the last 18 months. 
Earlier on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal had published an interview with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, in which Bullard said the time was already right for reducing the Fed’s asset purchases, which are currently running at $120 billion a month. Two of his colleagues on the Federal Open Markets Committee had argued the opposite over the last four days, and many analysts remain persuaded that the spike in prices is essentially transitory, distorted by factors such as the used car market and last year's collapse in energy prices.
The number was ""warmer than expected, but we knew risks were tilted to upside,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco via Twitter. He added that the May number ""represents peak inflation"". 
Others argued that the increase in prices appeared more broad-based than in the past.
""Apparel prices are jumping as consumers snap up everything that comes in,"" said Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton. ""Makeup is also in short supply. Masks are off and lipstick is on.""
The second-quarter earnings season got off to a mixed start, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock falling 1.2% on concerns that its headline profit figure was flattered by the release of reserves made earlier in the pandemic. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock, by contrast, rose 0.8% after riding a wave of merger and acquisition activity in the quarter, which offset a decline in trading revenue.  PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock rose 1.9% to a new record high after it raised its guidance for earnings growth in the current fiscal year to 11% from below 10% previously.
Also reporting were ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG), whose stock fell 2.2% after it warned of higher input price inflation, and construction goods company Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), which fell 2.2% after falling short of expectations.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)stock rose 0.2%, shrugging off overnight news that it had been fined nearly $600 million in France for failing to compensate publishers for carrying their news. The fine follows a similar action against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by Australia earlier this year that ended with the social media giant agreeing to pay publishers substantial fees in future.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 3.3% after reports of fresh problems with its 787 Dreamliner project that threaten to push back its timeline for delivering wide-bodied jet beyond its airline clients' summer peak season. Nokia ADRs (NYSE:NOK) meanwhile rose 7.8% to its highest in over two years after the maker of network equipment provided fresh evidence of a turnaround under CEO Pekka Lundmark."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's Temasek Holdings reported a 25% rise in its portfolio value to a record S$381 billion ($282 billion) in the year ended March 2021, with gains powered by a global equities rally and the public listing of some of its holdings.
Ranked among the biggest investors in the world, Temasek is anchored in Asia, with 64% exposure to the region as measured by underlying assets of its portfolio companies, most of which are in China and Singapore.
The increase in its portfolio value was the highest in a decade and follows a 2.2% drop the previous year, with the state investor making record investments and divestments in the latest year, Temasek executives told a news conference on Tuesday.
""The pandemic has accelerated the longer-term trends that shape our investment posture. This is especially so for the digitisation trend,"" said Mukul Chawla, joint head of Temasek's telecoms, media and technology investments.
Chawla said the shift to working from home had generated demand for online services, payments, digital health and technology platforms, spurring some of Temasek's privately held companies to go public.
Airbnb and food delivery business Doordash were some of Temasek's portfolio companies that listed.
Diego Lopez, managing director of sovereign wealth fund tracker Global SWF, described Temasek' performance as ""very robust"". 
He said that Temasek may not have benefited as much as some other global investors from the rally in U.S. equities among others because it is a more strategic investor.
The more than 50% rise in Temasek's investments shows strength and the know-how to take advantage of opportunities in the market when they occur, Lopez said.
In Temasek's Chinese technology portfolio, ride-hailing giant Didi Global and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fintech affiliate Ant Group have become targets of regulatory clampdowns in recent months, but Temasek executives said this is unlikely to lead to a shift in strategy and Temasek remains optimistic on China and the companies.
""It's not just in China that we are mindful of regulation and changing regulation. So I don't believe it changes our stance on China in any way,"" Chawla said. ""We will continue to invest, we will consider regulation as it comes forth.""
Unlike many state investors, the majority of Temasek's investments are in equities, with unlisted assets accounting for 45% of its total portfolio.
MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index surged 55% in the year to March 31, 2021 and Singapore's Straits Times index rose 28%.
The rally also boosted Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, which this month declared a record investment return.
Temasek's key public holdings include DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF), Alibaba Group and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
Temasek's one-year total shareholder return rose to 24.5% in the year to March, rebounding from a negative 2.28% a year earlier.

The Americas again accounted for the largest share of Temasek's new investments last year, followed by Singapore and China.

Investing.com – Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock was trading higher by 1.5% in Tuesday’s premarket as the bank raised its dividend after beating forecasts with its second-quarter earnings and revenue.
For the three-month period ended June 30, the financial services giant posted diluted earnings per share of $15.02 on revenue of $15.39 billion, beating estimates that saw EPS at $9.96 and revenue at $12.4 billion.
The Wall Street firm raised its quarterly dividend by 60% to $2 per share.
A booming market for share sales including initial public offerings as well as heightened M&A activity, both of which brought handsome fee income, contributed to the bank’s profit.
Net revenues in investment banking were $3.61 billion for the second quarter of 2021, 36% higher than a year earlier.
A booming equity market also boosted business at its asset management division which saw net revenue more than double from a year ago to $5.13 billion.  
Revenue from trading businesses suffered though as the volatility-driven boost in earlier phases of the pandemic waned amid a market looking for calmer times. Net trading revenue came down by more than a third to $4.90 billion from $7.58 billion in the first quarter of 2021."

(Reuters) - England's run to the final of the Euro 2020 soccer tournament bolstered business for bookmakers and food delivery firms but pubs lamented a missed opportunity because of coronavirus curbs.
Bookmakers reported record-breaking bets being placed during the month-long tournament, while online food delivery firm Just Eat Takeaway.com saw orders peak at 2.5 per minute on match days in Britain.
But pub operators missed out on 9 million pounds in beer sales during Sunday's final because of pandemic curbs on capacity, the British Beer & Pub Association has estimated. 
The final was the highest staking football match in Flutter's history ""by a long way"", the company told Reuters, with some 30 million pounds gambled across its Paddy Power, Sky Bet and Betfair platforms.
""England's performance has definitely played a role in spending patterns... We have never seen so much support for an England team before,"" a Flutter spokesperson said.
Rival Entain, which owns  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral, called the tournament its ""biggest ever sports-betting event"", estimating bets at about 250 million pounds.
A more online-focused company, 888, said its platform 888sport had seen more bets being placed on Sunday's England-Italy final than on any other sporting event, beating the record from last week's semi-final against Denmark. 
""It wasn't the result England were hoping for but Italy were more popular in the betting on the match and were well backed to win the tournament throughout the month,"" Kieran Spellman, vice president and head of sports at 888, told Reuters.
England's men lost the final on penalties to Italy, dashing hopes of a first major title in 55 years. 
Young & Co's Brewery - 245 of whose 273 pubs show sports - said limits on customer numbers and the requirement that all patrons sit at tables were hurting business.
""The opportunity was lost for our business due to heavy regulated COVID restrictions,"" a company spokesperson said. 
Specialist sports bars and pubs were only catering to around a third of their usual crowd on Sunday, trade body UKHospitality said.

Food delivery firms enjoyed a surge in orders as people gathered in their homes instead to watch the matches.
Finals day fittingly had an Italian flavour -- orders of dessert Tiramisu saw an uplift in many countries, while pizza outsold burgers, according to Just Eat Takeaway.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock was trading 0.6% lower in Tuesday’s premarket after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned the company’s Covid-19 vaccine raises the risk of a rare neurological condition.  
The condition, known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, results in the body’s immune system attacking the nerves, causing temporary paralysis. Most people fully recover, but in some cases, the paralysis can be severe.
The FDA has found a few such cases among the millions administered the J&J shot.  
According to a statement from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the cases were in men, many of whom were 50 or older, Reuters reported.
As per the FDA, 100 preliminary reports of GBS in the vaccine recipients include 95 serious cases that required hospitalization and one reported death.
According to Reuters, around 12.8 million people have received J&J's one-dose vaccine in the U.S.
J&J’s shot has had more than one hiccup in the past. There were cases of blood clotting but the FDA said the vaccine’s benefits outweighed the risks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stockbrokers might be fuelling ""speculative behaviour"" among retail investors by touting ""free"" services and accepting payments for sending stock orders to a specific exchange, the European Union's markets watchdog said on Tuesday.
A recent surge in retail investors buying stocks, largely on Wall Street but also to some extent in Europe, has highlighted the use of so-called payment for order flow (PFOF), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said.
""PFOF raises serious investor protection concerns,"" ESMA said in a statement, adding that in most cases, it was unlikely to be compatible with the bloc's securities laws.
""PFOF causes a clear conflict of interest between the firm and its clients, because it incentivises the firm to choose the third party offering the highest payment, rather than the best possible outcome for its clients when executing their orders,"" ESMA said.
Some brokers are also charging ""zero commission"" to investors for executing stock orders, often the same brokers that receive payment for order flow, it said.
Brokers are required to provide fair, clear and not misleading information to customers on all costs and charges, and marketing a service as cost free would infringe a firm's compliance with these requirements, ESMA said.

Such marketing could incentivise retail investors' gaming or speculative behaviour due to the incorrect perception that trading is free, it added.
Regulators in member states should ""prioritise"" this topic in their supervisory activities for 2021 or early 2022 to see how EU rules are being complied with, ESMA said.

The company now expects to deliver 6% organic revenue growth versus its previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth and 11% core constant currency EPS growth. It had previously guided for an increase of less than 10%.   
The company’s revised guidance came after a robust second-quarter performance, driven by demand for both its carbonated and non-carbonated drinks like juices and ready-to-drink tea.
From a channel perspective, the large format and convenience and gas channels delivered double-digit net revenue growth for the company in North America, its largest market.
It recorded double-digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Egypt, India, Germany, France, Spain, and South Africa.
For the 12 weeks ended June 12, the company’s net revenue rose 21% from a year ago to $19.21 billion. Core EPS rose 30% to $1.72.
A poll of analysts by Investing.com had estimated EPS to come in at $1.53 on revenue of $17.97 billion.

(Reuters) - United Airlines said on Tuesday it would buy 100 19-seat ES-19 electric planes from Swedish start-up Heart Aerospace, as the U.S. carrier eyes battery-powered aircraft for regional routes.
It is the latest in a series of such ""innovation-related"" announcements by United as major airlines come under pressure to cut emissions.
The U.S. carrier's venture funding arm said in a release it is also investing an undisclosed amount in the company with Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Mesa Airlines.
United would not disclose the value of the order, which is conditional on the aircraft's meeting safety, business and operating requirements. 
Mesa would buy an additional 100 ES-19s, subject to similar requirements, which can fly customers up to 250 miles. 
The plane will enter service as soon as 2026.
Electric planes can make only short urban or commuter trips because of the size and weight of the batteries. 
United could use the aircraft to connect hubs like Chicago O'Hare International Airport to smaller routes. Some of these routes have been cut by legacy carriers because they are too expensive. 
""With a lower cost profile you can bring back more smaller markets than were possible with the higher cost of a jet-fueled aircraft,"" Mike Leskinen, president of United Airlines Ventures, said in an interview. 
He sees the aircraft, which generate zero operational emissions, as a stepping stone toward larger planes. 
""We don't want to wait for 50 seats, 75 seats, 125-seat aircraft,"" Leskinen said. ""We want to get involved now by investing in a company that we think has a big technological lead with the hopes of over time working with them to move the size of the aircraft to larger gauge.""

This year, the carrier also invested and announced an order in electric aircraft company Archer.
United has said it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in a subdued fashion Tuesday, ahead of the release of key inflation data and with some of the country’s banking giants leading off the new quarterly earnings season.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 50 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices have soared to record levels in recent sessions, boosted by a successful vaccination program ensuring the country reopens while being underpinned by massive levels of both monetary and fiscal stimulus.
However, it’s debatable how much longer these factors will remain in place.
 The U.S. recorded its highest daily total of new Covid cases since May over the weekend as the highly-transmissible delta variant works its way through the unvaccinated portion of the population.
Attention now turns to the release of the consumer price index for June, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to have risen by 4.9%, a small drop from May’s 5%.  May's number was heavily influenced by the rise in used car prices this spring, and by a base effect from last year's energy markets that is now fading.
Rising inflation has been an important influence on Wall Street's recent movements as investors fear an overheating economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy sooner-than expected.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, previously seen as something of a dove, now says the time is right to reduce the pace of central bank's bond purchases. 
In the corporate sector, the second-quarter earnings season starts in earnest with the release of numbers from banking giants JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Their quarterly updates are expected to be strong given the recent rise in bond yields as well as sustained equity market strength.
Additionally, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday, betting on increased demand for its drinks as the entertainment sector reopens, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also likely to be in focus amid concerns the drug maker’s Covid-19 vaccine was linked to an increased risk of a rare neurological disorder.
Elsewhere, oil prices pushed higher Tuesday after the International Energy Agency warned that energy markets will  “tighten significantly” if the group of top producers, known as OPEC+, doesn’t come to an agreement over adding additional output.
The American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release its U.S. crude oil supply data later in the session and inventories are expected to drop for an eighth consecutive week. They fell to the lowest since February 2020 in the week to July 2.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $74.16 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $75.31.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,808.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1842."

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 06:17AM ET</span>","After vaccination burnout, Delta variant spurs countries to speed up shots","By Matthias Blamont, Michael Erman and Maayan Lubell
(Reuters) - The daily pace of COVID vaccinations has increased in about a dozen countries due to the arrival of the more contagious Delta variant and governments expanding their vaccination drives, a data analysis by Reuters found.
Israel's rate of vaccinations has seen a sharp pickup. The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Spain are all vaccinating at their fastest speed to date. Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden are not far behind. 
But it is a different story in the United States. At its current, declining pace, 70% of the U.S. population will not receive a first dose of vaccine until Dec. 1, according to the Reuters analysis of Our World in Data vaccination figures https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations. 
At the current pace, Canada, Chile, the United Kingdom, and eight others will reach that benchmark before the end of the month. And if the current pace is maintained, five more countries will hit 70% by the end of August. Those dates could change depending on many factors, including approvals to vaccinate younger children. (Graphic on vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/2TbE5vy
VACCINATION BURNOUT? 
In Israel the vaccination rate had plateaued in April as new COVID infections were on a months-long steady decline. But when the arrival of Delta brought a spike of cases in June, the government jumped in quickly with a new campaign urging teenagers to get the shot and parents to vaccinate their children aged 12 to 15. 
In many countries, vaccination drives slowed before reaching 70% or more of the population - a threshold some experts say could help largely curb COVID-19 transmission through so-called herd immunity, when combined with people who developed immunity following an infection. (Graphic on global vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/3tUM8ta
The ability of the coronavirus to mutate quickly into new variants, such as Delta, that reduce the effectiveness of vaccines has cast doubt on whether herd immunity can be achieved. However, various governments have still set national vaccination goals close to that number to encourage citizens to get inoculated. The European Union, for instance, has distributed enough vaccines for 70% of its population.
In some places, regulators have just recently authorized use of the shots in 12 to 15 year olds; in others, supply is catching up with demand.
Many of those countries had initially focused on giving shots to older populations and other high-risk groups. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorized by the U.S. and European Union for people aged 12 and over, but others such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) are only available to adults. 
With the spread of the Delta variant, countries are trying to reignite their campaigns by overcoming skepticism about the vaccine and misconceptions that the young do not need a shot. 
Heidi Larson, director of the international Vaccine Confidence Project and a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said a rise in vaccinations due to Delta variant concerns may have been held back by changes seen as signalling an end to the pandemic, such as lifting mask mandates and travel bans. 
""We're giving a lot of mixed messages right now,"" Larson said. Israel is an exception, she said. It has reimposed measures such as requiring mask use indoors. 
While a decline in vaccination rates is to be expected, it has created pockets where groups including children, the elderly and homeless remain at risk, experts say. 
""A deceleration of vaccination in itself is a logical phenomenon,"" said Vincent Marechal, a senior virologist with France's Sorbonne University. But slowing down too early opens the door to the virus spreading - mostly among children - and evolving to become more dangerous for them. 
THE YOUNG DRIVE GAINS 
Portugal, where the Delta variant accounts for more than 90% of cases, has the highest number of new cases in the European Unions since mid-June. It has also doubled its pace of vaccinations from a low of around 60,000 inoculations per day, in part by including 18 to 29 year olds. (Graphic on global cases) https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi
In Singapore, the rate of vaccinations has recently gone up after opening its vaccination program to people aged 12 to 39 years old. It also hastened the delivery of vaccine supplies to help it accelerate the rollout.
In Britain, where 87% of adults have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the government stepped up its target to have all adults vaccinated by July 19, when its COVID restrictions are slated to be lifted. It has begun giving second shots sooner as well to fight the Delta variant.
NO MAGICAL SOLUTION
In France, where 53.3% of the adult population has received one dose of a vaccine and 41.3% two doses or a single-dose shot, authorities are ramping up outreach to those who have not made vaccination appointments. 
""We are indeed hitting a glass ceiling and trying to come up every day with ideas, and the good news is we are seeing a very recent pick up in bookings,"" a source close to the health ministry said last week. 
The source added the government was still hoping to see 40 million of adults receive a first dose by the end of August versus 35.9 million as of July 12. 
France is about to open temporary vaccination centres at cultural venues across the country such as in Avignon, home to a world-famous theatre festival, and vaccination buses will tour the Bordeaux wine region of Gironde to catch seasonal workers.
COVID-19 jabs will be mandatory for France's health workers and anyone wanting to get into a cinema or board a train will soon need to show proof of vaccination or a negative test under new rules announced by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday.
In the United States, where young people have been eligible since April, vaccinations are stagnant. The Biden administration missed its goal of 70% of adults having had at least one COVID-19 shot by July 4 and has struggled to reach 50% fully vaccinated even as it has warned of outbreaks due to the Delta variant.

Younger people have lagged older ones in seeking vaccines while shots among Black and Hispanic Americans have trailed those of Asian and white Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
""Whether governments throw in incentives or coercive measures, there is no magical solution,"" said Martin Blachier, an epidemiologist with Paris-based healthcare data analysis firm Public Health Expertise. ""Some will just not get the vaccine.""

(Reuters) - Confidence among small businesses in the United States improved slightly in June after declining in May, despite owners worrying about a labor shortage and inflation, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index rose 2.9 points to a reading of 102.5 in June. Seven of the 10 index components improved and three declined.
“Small businesses' optimism is rising as the economy opens up, yet a record number of employers continue to report that there are few or no qualified applicants for open positions,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement.
""Owners are also having a hard time keeping their inventory stocks up with strong sales and supply chain problems.""
A net 28% of businesses plan to create new jobs in the next three months, up one point from May and a record high.
Earlier this month, the trade group said in its monthly jobs report that 46% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, down from 48% in May.
The quality of labor ranked as businesses' ""single most important problem,"" with 26% of respondents selecting it among 10 issues, near the survey high of 27%. Some 56% of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for open jobs in June, down from 57% in May.
The NFIB survey comes as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits slightly rose last week while continuing claims declined.

Additionally, hiring appears to have strengthened in June as U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months.
Businesses in the NFIB survey also flagged inflation as a worry, and a record 44% plan to increase prices in the next three months.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England scrapped its remaining pandemic curbs on dividends paid by HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and other top lenders with immediate effect on Tuesday, saying its stress tests showed they could cope with the fallout from COVID on the economy.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said Britain's rapid vaccination rollout had led to an improvement in the economic outlook, allowing the central bank to relax its controls on how much lenders can pay to shareholders.
""But risks to the recovery remain. Households and businesses are likely to need continuing support from the financial system as the economy recovers and the government's support measures unwind over the coming months,"" Bailey said in a statement.
Shares in British lenders rose, with HSBC , NatWest, Barclays , Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) all up by between 1% and 2%, compared with a 0.3% gain for the FTSE 100 index. 
As Britain shut down much of its economy for the first time in March last year, the BoE told lenders to suspend dividends and share buy-backs until the end of 2020 and it also recommended scrapping bonuses for senior staff.
The BoE initially eased its curbs last December as the pandemic's fallout became clearer, saying payouts could resume within ""guardrails"".
The BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said the ""extraordinary guardrails on shareholder distributions are no longer necessary"" following its annual stress test of banks' financial health.
The U.S. Federal Reserve said in June that large banks would no longer face coronavirus crisis restrictions on how much they can spend in buying back stock and paying dividends.
The European Central Bank's plans to let euro zone lenders resume payouts to shareholders from October, barring a new economic slump.
Bailey told a news conference on Tuesday that, unlike its move on dividends, the BoE had no plan to lift its guidance on bonuses. But Deputy Governor Sam Woods said it was important to get back to a ""more normal setting"" for bankers' pay.
BOE WATCHING CRYPTO, THE CLOUD
In its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report, the regulator sounded a new note of caution on cryptocurrencies, saying there were signs of larger institutions starting to get involved, which could lead to spillovers into the wider economy.
The BoE urged giant cloud computing firms not to be secretive about their operations. It fears that could hinder its checks on the stability of the banking sector, which is increasingly using firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to improve efficiency and cut costs.
The central bank also said asset prices looked stretched as investors increasingly took risks and underwriting standards for some loans slipped.
The FPC confirmed it would keep the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) for major banks at zero percent until at least December, meaning any subsequent increase would not take effect until the end of 2022 at the earliest.

The buffer is intended to rise and fall over the course of the economic cycle to limit lending at the top of a boom and boost it during a downturn.
""The FPC expects banks to use all elements of their capital buffers as necessary to support the economy through the recovery,"" the BoE said.

Shares of Zett, a sports gear wholesaler, have seen spikes in prices as well as trading volume. 
The company's shares dipped 0.8% on Tuesday, but are still 52% higher since Thursday and have lifted the company's market capitalisation by 2.7 billion yen ($24.5 million) to 7.8 billion yen.
Trading volume in the normally illiquid shares also surged, with 24.5 million shares changing hands over the last four business days, 6.7 times more than their total trading during the first half of this year.
Japanese baseball professional Ohtani, also known as Shotime, has an ability to both pitch and hit at an elite level.
His skills will be on display on Tuesday in Denver, when he becomes the first player in history to pitch and hit in Major League Baseball's All-Star Game.
The trading frenzy is driven in part by speculation his performance could boost the popularity of baseball and increase demand for sports gear.
On the online board of Yahoo Finance, popular with retail traders, some bet the rally could go further. ""Popularity of baseball will soar. Let's buy more,"" said one. 
But others were sceptical, especially professional traders.
""There's no point trying to find out any meanings in the moves. This must be a short-term play by individual investors,"" Yuya Fukue, trader at Rheos Capital Works, said.
Zett says it has no explanation.
""There is nothing we can disclose in relation to our earnings at this stage,"" a company spokesman said.
Neither has the activity affected bigger, sports-related companies, such as Asics, which provides Ohtani with bats and gloves.

Shares of Asics rose 1.8% on Tuesday, but they have mostly traded steadily in line with the overall market.

The report said that U.S. companies face threats including the Chinese government's ability to gain access to data that foreign companies store in Hong Kong. 
The risks also included the new law that allows Beijing to impose sanctions against individuals or entities involved in making or implementing discriminatory measures against Chinese citizens or entities, the FT said https://on.ft.com/2UK19Sw, citing three people familiar with the matter.
On Tuesday, the United States will update a warning that former President Donald Trump's administration issued on Xinjiang last year, FT said, adding that it will stress on the legal risks that companies face unless they ensure that their supply chains are not implicated in forced labour in Xinjiang.
This warning is ""typical political manipulation and double standards"" by Washington, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. 
He said the rights of foreign investors in Hong Kong are clearly protected by Hong Kong's laws, including the Basic Law, its mini constitution.

The FT report also said that the United States will impose more sanctions this week in response to China's crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
China dismisses accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang and says its policies are necessary to stamp out separatists and religious extremists who plotted attacks and stirred up tension between mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs and Han, China's largest ethnic group.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was down 0.5% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that a fresh production defect has emerged on its 787 Dreamliner planes.
The report said the company could slow down its previously disclosed monthly output of five planes as it addresses the quality issues.
Boeing expects the newly discovered defect to take at least three weeks to address, according to the WSJ report. That means its customers may not get new Dreamliners in time for what is usually the year's peak travel season.  
The company halted delivery of the wide-bodied jets to airlines nearly two months ago, after federal air-safety regulators rejected its proposals regarding how it inspects its jets for other production defects. It was the second time this year that it had had to pause deliveries. 
The WSJ reported the Federal Aviation Administration as saying that the latest quality issue doesn't pose an immediate safety threat.

(Reuters) - European stocks eased from all-time highs on Tuesday ahead of a key U.S. inflation reading, but British banks kept UK's FTSE 100 afloat after a central bank move to scrap curbs on dividends.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.1% after hitting a record high in early trading.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, and Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) rose between 1.1% and 1.8% after the Bank of England scrapped pandemic-era restrictions on dividends from top lenders.
UK's FTSE 100 rose 0.3%, while other main regional indexes fell.
Investors are awaiting U.S. consumer price data for June — set to be released later in the day — to see if the recent rise in prices is persistent and strong enough to spur a faster-than-expected policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.
""We are less interested in when the peak is and much more interested in how enduring price pressures are likely to be,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. 
""We have no doubt that this 'peak' narrative is likely to be all the talk on Tuesday, but that misses a much bigger point: sticky prices are likely to linger for quite some time.""
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday it has pledged to be ""persistent"" and will not repeat its past mistake of tightening policy too early.
Among individual stocks, Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) jumped 6.6% after it said it planned to raise its full-year outlook.
Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) rose 2.0% as it returned to profit in the first six months of 2021 and its sales jumped more than 50%. Rival Richemont climbed 0.4%.
Meanwhile, major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), will report earnings later in the day. European reporting season will kick into high gear later this month, with analysts expecting second-quarter profit for STOXX 600 companies to more than double from a year ago, as per Refinitiv IBES data.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) on Tuesday downgraded some of  Credit Suisse 's (S:CSGN) senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings, saying risks related to the Archegos and Greensill affairs would take significant resources to resolve.
Switzerland's second-largest bank was forced to wind down $10 billion in funds linked to collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill and then suffered billions in losses after family office Archegos imploded.
""As indicated by similar cases in the past, the investigation and remediation of these matters will likely consume a significant amount of bank resources and managerial focus and take time to resolve, during which CS will remain vulnerable to the aforementioned risk factors,"" the rating agency said.
Credit Suisse declined to comment.
S&P and Fitch earlier this year both revised Credit Suisse's outlook to negative following the Archegos and Greensill scandals.
Moody's on Tuesday downgraded its long-term senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings of Credit Suisse AG by one notch to A1 from Aa3, pointing to deficiencies in the bank's risk management.
Credit Suisse AG is a sub-entity that houses the bank's main operations, including its investment banking and wealth management businesses.
A framework revision had also reduced Moody's view on Credit Suisse AG's capacity to absorb unexpected losses, the rating agency said.
Moody's affirmed Baa1 ratings on long-term senior unsecured debt for the Credit Suisse Group as a whole, and said the outlook for Credit Suisse's ratings was now stable.
The rating agency also said it expected the bank to be able to contain further possible reputational effects and did not expect strategic adjustments to meaningfully impair Credit Suisse Group's ability to deliver on mid-term profitability goals.
Nonetheless, the agency highlighted potential additional financial strains from the Archegos and Greensill matters, and the potential for client defections and franchise impairment as cause for concern in its downgrade of Credit Suisse AG.

""Although Moody's anticipates that CS will enhance its governance and risk management practices, including implementing the recommendations resulting from internal and external investigations, the extent and effectiveness of these measures will remain uncertain for some time,"" Moody's said. 
""In addition, the final financial and reputational implications of the aforementioned events for CS also remain unclear.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union and Ukraine signed on Tuesday a memorandum of understanding (MoU) covering critical raw materials and batteries as the 27-country bloc tries to diversify supplies following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The move is part of the European Commission's Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials announced in September to bolster supplies of materials vital to sectors including aerospace, defence, electronics, automotive and renewable energy, as well as energy-intensive industries and the health sector.
European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal signed the MoU in Kyiv during a EU-Ukraine conference.
""Securing a sustainable supply of raw materials is an essential prerequisite for delivering on green and digital transition objectives,"" Sefcovic said ahead the visit to Kyiv.
""Developing cooperation with the EU ... is of strategic importance to us and will help integrate mineral supply chains and strengthen strategic resilience during post-pandemic recovery,"" Shmygal said.

The EU last year updated its list of critical raw materials to include bauxite, lithium, titanium and strontium. China provides 98% of the EU's supply of rare earth elements.
To power up e-car batteries and for energy storage alone, the EU estimates it will need up to 18 times more lithium by 2030 and up to 60 times more by 2050.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS)'s asset management arm and a company co-founded by private equity firm Warburg Pincus said on Tuesday they had jointly acquired logistics assets in China worth $488 million.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management and New Ease, a new economy infrastructure investor, developer and manager, said they bought two collections of logistics real estate projects in gateway cities throughout China.
The assets include institutional-grade, modern warehouse properties in the south eastern Chinese city of Kunshan and central Chinese cities Zhengzhou and Sanhe, and properties in central China's Henan and Hubei provinces to be developed into facilities to meet the demand from e-commerce companies and third-party logistics providers, the two investors said in a statement.
Their investment comes at a time when China's logistics sector is consolidating after the COVID-19 pandemic boosted e-commerce and supply chain demands.
The two companies did not disclose the sellers of the logistics assets.
In February, private equity firm FountainVest Partners struck a deal to buy Chinese logistics firm CJ Rokin from South Korea's CJ Logistics Corp that gave Rokin an enterprise value of 6.9 billion yuan ($1.07 billion), after winning a competitive auction.

""The continued development of China's economy, especially through the rapid pace of advanced digitalization of commerce, has further accelerated the development of the logistics warehousing industry and accompanying integrated services,"" said Luke Wei, Goldman asset management's managing director.
Headquartered in Shanghai, New Ease is managing a portfolio of over six million square meters of projects that are in operation or under development. It has a total asset under management of about $5 billion and established multiple ventures with global leading investors.

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
Caution was the watchword, with a lot of the focus on the U.S. ahead of not only important inflation numbers but also the quarterly earnings reports from a number of major banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). These numbers are often used as a gauge of the health of the economy as it reopens. 
The banking sector has also been in the spotlight in Europe. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investor Service cut the main debt rating of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to A1 from Aa3 in the wake of its problems with Greensill Capital and the collapsed hedge fund Archegos. Credit Suisse’s stock fell 0.1%.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC (LON:HSBA), and Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) stocks rose between 1% and 1.6%.
Elsewhere, Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock rose 6.8% after it said it planned to raise its full-year outlook as business picked up pace in the second quarter.
Earlier Tuesday, China's exports grew much more strongly than expected in June, indicating a recovery in global demand as vaccination programs reopened economies around the world.
Exports in dollar terms rose 32.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with 27.9% growth in May, and much stronger than the forecast increase of around 23%.
Back in Europe, German consumer inflation rose 0.4% on the month in June, the annual rate falling to 2.3% from 2.5% in May. The easing of the year-on-year rate due to the rebound in energy prices last year at could be a foretaste of  June U.S. CPI number, which is also expected to fall slightly from May’s 5.0% level.
Elsewhere, oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, helped by the expectation of a further drop in U.S. crude inventories as demand picks up in the world’s largest consumer.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.

Exports in dollar terms rose 32.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with 27.9% growth in May, and much stronger than the forecast increase of around 23%.
However, a lot of the focus Tuesday will be stateside as quarterly earnings reports are due this week from a number of major U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) later in the session.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Ian Silk will step down as AustralianSuper's chief executive officer and will be replaced by head of risk Paul Schroder, a former union boss, said Australia's largest pension fund on Tuesday.
Silk, which oversaw AustralianSuper's growth from managing A$21 billion ($15.75 billion)in workers' savings to over A$225 billion over the past 15 years, had recently told the board of his intentions, said the pension fund in a statement. 
Silk also played a key role in representing Australia's retirement fund industry at the 2018 Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct. 
Schroder, who has worked as the fund's chief risk officer since 2019, was unanimously chosen by the board and would take the helm as CEO ""later this year"", the fund said without giving more details.
""Paul is exceptionally well placed to lead the Fund in its next phase as it moves towards being a profit-for-member A$500 billion superannuation fund in the next five years, that uses the scale of the organisation to benefit members,"" Silk said.
The inquiry found widespread misconduct amongst ""for-profit"" funds, many of whom acknowledge taking ""fees for no service"" from members, including from accounts of deceased people.
The scandal led to an avalanche of outflows away from the ""for-profit"" funds as workers moved to relatively scandal-free ""industry"" funds, such as AustralianSuper, who are aligned with worker's unions but open to anyone to join. 
That has fuelled the rapid growth of industry funds such as AustralianSuper into giant investors with increasing power to sway corporate policies, launch takeover approaches for Australian companies, and potentially act as activist shareholders.

Before joining AustralianSuper in 2007, Schroder was the National Secretary for the Finance Sector Union of Australia.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Elon Musk insisted in court that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's board controls the company but also said the electric vehicle maker would ""die"" if he wasn't the chief executive, as he ended his first day of testimony on Monday in defense of Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity.
The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges the celebrity CEO strong-armed Tesla's board of directors into depleting the company’s assets with the $2.6 billion all-stock deal for SolarCity.
The CEO at the time owned a roughly 22% stake in both Tesla and SolarCity, which was founded by his cousins, and some Tesla shareholders alleged the deal was aimed at bailing out Musk's investment in the solar panel company.
Kicking off a two-week trial in Wilmington, Delaware, Musk, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and a slightly askew dark tie, testified that he has tried ""very hard not to be the CEO of Tesla, but I have to or frankly Tesla is going to die.”
Board members and others involved in the deal will testify beginning as soon as Tuesday, when Musk will also return to the witness stand.
The lawsuit accuses Musk of dominating the board's deal discussions, pushing Tesla to pay more for SolarCity and misleading shareholders about the company's deteriorating financial health.
Musk told the court that the Tesla board handled the SolarCity deal and he was not part of the board committee that negotiated the terms. 
""I don't even know what happened,"" he testified.
Musk responded calmly during cross-examination from shareholder attorney Randall Baron, but Baron's yes or no questions often elicited lengthy, meandering responses. At one point Musk called the lawyer ""a bad human being."" 
Baron asked if the board vetted his Technoking title, which he gave himself in March.
“It generated a whole bunch of free press and Tesla doesn’t advertise and it’s helpful to general sales,” he said. He called the title a joke: “I think I’m funny.”
Shares of Tesla closed up about 4.4% on Monday at $685.75.
Central to the case are claims that despite his minority stake, Musk was a controlling shareholder of Tesla due to his ties to board members and domineering style. That designation would impose a tougher legal standard and increase the likelihood that the court would conclude the deal was unfair to shareholders. 
Shareholders have asked the court to order Musk, one of world's richest people, to repay to Tesla what it spent on the deal.
Musk was initially questioned for about an hour by his attorney, Evan Chesler, who asked him to describe his relationship with the board.
“I’d say good,"" Musk replied. ""They work hard and are competent. They provide good advice and are rigorous in acting on behalf of shareholders.”
He said he did not set pay for directors or have the ability to fire or hire them. He also said that because he owned the same percentage of stock in both companies and there was no cash involved in the deal, he didn't benefit. He said the merger was aimed at combining Tesla's battery business with SolarCity's sustainable energy generation. 
""There was no financial gain,"" he testified.
Legal experts said the judge will be looking for evidence that Musk threatened board members or that directors felt they could not stand up to him. 
""It would be a surprise to most people if the court were to come out and say that he doesn't control here,"" said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. ""Because he certainly acts like he does."" 

Tesla's directors settled allegations from the same lawsuit last year for $60 million, paid by insurance, without admitting fault. 
Delaware Court of Chancery Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights will likely take months before he issues a ruling.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said late on Monday that some undelivered Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners have a new manufacturing quality issue that the largest U.S. planemaker will fix before the planes will be delivered.
The FAA said the issue is ""near the nose on certain 787 Dreamliners in the company's inventory of undelivered airplanes. This issue was discovered as part of the ongoing system-wide inspection of Boeing's 787 shimming processes required by the FAA.""
The FAA added that ""although the issue poses no immediate threat to flight safety, Boeing has committed to fix these airplanes before resuming deliveries."" The air regulators added after a review of data it ""will determine whether similar modifications should be made on 787s already in commercial service.""
Boeing declined to comment. Reuters first reported the new production issue to hit Boeing's troubled 787 Dreamliner. The company has about 100 undelivered 787s in inventory.
Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 in late May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method, saying it was ""waiting for additional data from Boeing before determining whether the company's solution meets safety regulations.""
The FAA in May had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes.
The U.S. planemaker's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical and other issues since late last year, and it had only resumed deliveries of the 787s in March after a five-month hiatus - only to halt them again in May.
Two key U.S. lawmakers said in May they were seeking records from Boeing and the FAA on production issues involving the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.
The FAA said in September it was investigating manufacturing flaws involving some 787 Dreamliners. Boeing said in August airlines operating its 787 Dreamliners removed eight jets from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues.
In September, Boeing said some 787 airplanes had shims that were not the proper size, and some airplanes had areas that did not meet skin-flatness specifications.
Last month at a conference, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said the 787s were ""performing beautifully.""
But he added ""the FAA rightfully wants to know more about the analytics and process controls that we put in place, which are different than the ones that we had previously, so that we could be more perfect.""
Calhoun said he hoped the FAA's review of Boeing's approach was ""measured in months and not longer than the calendar year.""
In February, Reuters reported Boeing was beginning painstaking repairs and forensic inspections to fix structural integrity flaws embedded deep inside at least 88 parked 787s.
The fuel-efficient 787 has been a hit with airlines, which have ordered nearly 1,900 of the advanced twin-aisle jet worth nearly $150 billion at list prices.
The FAA has been critical of some Boeing safety practices in recent years and imposed a $6.6 million fine on Boeing in February for failing to comply with a 2015 safety agreement.

The agency did not allow the Boeing 737 MAX to resume flights for nearly 20 months following two fatal crashes and only after it added significant safeguards to a key system.
Last month, Reuters reported the FAA told Boeing in May its planned 777X was not yet ready for a significant certification step and warned it ""realistically"" will not certify the airplane until mid- to late 2023.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Tuesday morning ahead of trade data from China that could offer clues to the country’s recovery from COVID-19. Also on investors’ radars are U.S. inflation data and second-quarter earnings.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.25% by 10:07 PM ET (2:07 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.14%. The Chinese trade data, including exports, imports and the trade balance, will be released later in the day. Further data, including the second-quarter GDP and industrial production figures, will be released on Thursday.
Investors were also calculating the impact of a slowing economic recovery in China, alongside the fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in several regions, on fuel demand.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.55%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.83% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.66%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.46%. The possibility that a COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney could be extended capped gains for the Australian index, however. The National Australia Bank (NAB) Business Confidence Index also fell to 11 in June, below May’s 20 figure.
Meanwhile, auctions of three-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes helped steady yields. A sale of $58 billion of three-year notes fetched yields slightly higher than before the auction, while the sale of $38 billion of 10-year notes saw stronger demand.
With Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) among the names kicking off the earnings season, expectations for a solid earnings season are supporting a rally in global shares.
Investors are also placing bets on when central banks will begin asset tapering as economic recovery from COVID-19 continues in some countries. However, they also remain concerned about inflation alongside the recent spread of COVID-19's Delta variant and declining vaccination rates.
They now await the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for June, due later in the day, and the producer price index, due later in the week, to further gauge inflationary pressures.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will also testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday and Thursday, where his comments will be closely monitored for any hints on the Fed’s asset tapering schedule.
“Wall Street is bracing for a volatile week as market participants are divided on a bevy of issues that include whether to bet on growth or cyclicals and if inflation acceleration intensifies,” Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note.
“One thing that everyone agrees upon is that second-quarter earnings will be stellar,” the note added.
Also on the central bank front, a slew of policy decisions will be handed down throughout the week. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s decision is due Wednesday, with the Bank of Korea and Bank of Japan will hand down their decisions on Thursday and Friday respectively."

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it approved a Blue Origin license to carry humans on the New Shepard launch system into space.
Former Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos is set to fly to the edge of space on Blue Origin's maiden crewed voyage on July 20. 
Blue Origin is authorized to carry humans while its FAA license is valid through August and is approved to conduct these missions from its Launch Site One facility in Texas, the agency confirmed.
Blue Origin was required to verify its launch vehicle's hardware and software worked safely during a test flight and the FAA confirmed it met regulatory requirements.
Blue Origin's flight will come a little over a week after space-tourism rival Virgin Galactic successfully sent a crew including its founder, British billionaire Richard Branson, to the edge of space.

Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, as well as the space firm founded by rival billionaire Elon Musk, are working to usher in a new era of routine commercial civilian space travel in what has been popularized as the ""billionaire space race.""
Proving rocket travel is safe for the public is key to developing what the Swiss-based investment bank UBS estimates will be a $3 billion annual space tourism market in a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Monday asked two federal appeals courts to dismiss the Justice Department's legal challenges to court rulings that barred a Trump-era effort to ban new downloads of Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok.
Last month, President Joe Biden withdrew a series of executive orders issued by former President Donald Trump that sought to ban new downloads of WeChat, TikTok and other Chinese apps and ordered a new review.
The Commerce Department on June 22 formally withdrew a list of prohibited transactions with ByteDance-owned TikTok and Tencent-owned WeChat issued in September that sought to bar downloads of the apps.
The Justice Department said Monday that the government's legal challenges were now moot. It asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Third Circuit to dismiss its appeals.
Separately, the Justice Department said in a filing with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that it had not decided how to proceed in its appeal of a lower court ruling blocking restrictions on WeChat that the Trump administration had sought to put in place. 
The government said it was in talks with lawyers for the WeChat users who had filed suit ""about appropriate next steps in this appeal."" The government plans to inform the court about its decision by July 26.
During Donald Trump's presidency, the Commerce Department had also sought to bar other transactions that would have effectively banned WeChat's use in the United States and later sought similar restrictions that would have barred TikTok's use. Courts blocked all those restrictions from taking effect.
The Biden order directed the Commerce Department to monitor software applications like TikTok that could affect U.S. national security, as well as to make recommendations within 120 days to protect U.S. data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters in a June 28 interview that the department was ""just getting started"" with its review that will include an ""evidence-based"" analysis.
""The whole point of the executive order is to take really strong steps to protect Americans' data from collection and utilization by foreign adversaries,"" Raimondo said.
Biden's executive order also revoked another Trump order signed in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.

That Trump order directed officials to ban transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat pay. No bans were issued.
A separate U.S. national security review of TikTok, launched in late 2019, remains active.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed at their highest levels ever on Monday, lifted by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and bank stocks as investors eyed the start of the second-quarter earnings season and a batch of economic data.
The S&P 500 financials, communication services and real estate sector indexes each gained more than 0.8%.
Tesla rallied over 4% and was the top contributor to gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. CEO Elon Musk insisted in court on Monday he does not control Tesla, and he said he did not enjoy being the electric vehicle company’s chief executive as he took the stand to defend the company’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity.
The S&P 500 banks index climbed 1.3% ahead of quarterly earnings reports this week from major banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose over 1% and Goldman Sachs rallied more than 2%, fueling the Dow's gains. 
Investors will closely watch quarterly reports for early clues on the how long the U.S. economic recovery may last, with June-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies expected to rise 66%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The S&P 500 has rallied about 17% so far this year, with some investors questioning how long Wall Street's rally may last and concerned about a potential downturn.
""Earnings season is going to be warmly greeted as an opportunity for existing biases to be confirmed,"" warned Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management in New York. ""Even if forecasts are not as rosy as what the most bullish had hoped, it's all going to get rationalized away."" 
Focus this week will also be on a series of economic reports, including headline U.S. inflation data and retail sales. As well, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to appear before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday for views on inflation.
Investors have been concerned about higher inflation and the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant in the past few sessions, with traders seesawing between a preference for economy linked-value stocks and tech-heavy growth names.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36% to end at 34,996.18 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.35% to 4,384.63. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.21% to 14,733.24.
All three closed at their highest levels ever.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) jumped over 4% to a two-month high after it and Marvel's ""Black Widow"" superhero movie took in $80 million in its first weekend. And the entertainment company plans to raise prices for its ESPN Plus streaming service.
Didi Global Inc dropped about 7% after it confirmed China's cyberspace administration notified app stores to remove the ride-hailing company's 25 apps and said the move could impact its revenue in the region.
Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) tumbled 17% after the space tourism company said it may sell up to $500 million worth of shares, a day after the company completed its first fully crewed test flight into space with billionaire founder Richard Branson on board. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.3 billion shares, compared with the 10.5 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - After more than 16 months of working from home, some  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) employees in San Francisco and New York returned to the office on Monday as the company reopened its corporate campuses at 50% capacity in the two cities.
With COVID-19 vaccination rates on the rise, major U.S. tech companies are diverging on how and when to reopen their offices. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google announced employees can voluntarily return to the office starting in late July, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects employees to work from the office three days per week starting in early September. 
Twitter employees shared pictures of their breakfasts and unmasked selfies in the elevator. One employee, referencing the food and music at the social media firm's San Francisco office, wrote on Twitter, ""I am more stoked than I expected to be.""
While some employees expressed excitement, most want minimal time in the office. An internal company survey found that 45% of employees in San Francisco and 63% in New York intend to return to the office, even if just one day per week. The remaining intend to keep working remotely.
Twitter, which announced in May 2020 that employees could work from anywhere, is requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for office reentry. The company is still allowing employees whose jobs can be done remotely to work from home indefinitely. Twitter CFO Ned Segal said in a tweet that the company hopes to support employees ""whether on their sofa or in an office.""

Twitter will continue to adjust employees' salaries based on cost of living in their location - a consideration for those who choose to work remotely. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google have also reaffirmed their commitment to location-based pay policies.
Twitter will decide when to reopen other offices based on COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates in each location, according to the company.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Monday said it has fined an Atlanta-based financial technology firm $2.5 million for processing and servicing loans to consumers who did not request or authorize them to do so.
GreenSky, LLC is a mobile app that connects merchants and banks with customers who are usually seeking financing for mostly home-improvement projects. 
The CFPB also ordered the company to refund or cancel up to $9 million in loans it allowed outside merchants to promote and offer consumers.
The order comes as part of ongoing scrutiny of fintech firms that automate the delivery and use of financial services via online platforms and devices, like mobile phones.
The agency found the lender to have acted unfairly toward consumers by failing to ""create and implement appropriate and effective controls during the loan application, approval, and funding processes,"" as well as failing to ""implement adequate merchant training and oversight.""
The CFPB said in its order that GreenSky violated The Consumer Financial Protection Act, which aims to protect consumers against lenders who engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.
The company in a statement on its website said ""GreenSky has agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $2.5 million and to provide redress to eligible consumers where there is insufficient evidence of customer authorization.""
""We cooperated fully with the CFPB in connection with its inquiry and respect and value the important role it plays in regard to consumer protection,"" GreenSky President Tim Kaliban said.
Consumers who may be seeking to remodel their home may solicit the services of a contractor that offers financing through GreenSky's app. The merchant or contractor then submits an auto-populated loan application to GreenSky, including the client's data, which takes about a minute to complete.

""GreenSky's careless business and customer service practices enabled its merchants to take advantage of vulnerable consumers who needed financial help to repair their homes and to pay for other critical retail services by setting up loans without consumers' consent,"" said CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio. 
""For consumers to wind up in debt to GreenSky for loans they never knew about is simply wrong. The CFPB will not stand for practices that allow conduct like this in the marketplace.""

Thus, we think top chip stocks Intel (INTC), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) should be attractive investment bets now.Bitcoin has plunged 44.3% over the past three months, making it the worst performing cryptocurrency over this period. The most popular cryptocurrency is currently trading below its $39,539.50 and $36,292.27 respective 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which indicates a downtrend. An intensifying regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies, particularly in China and the U.K., will likely keep bitcoin prices under pressure in the near term.
However, the semiconductor industry is gearing up to be a major market mover over the long run given the widespread application of semiconductor chips in consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs). The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act authorized $110 billion to be spent over five years to aid research in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other technology. U.S. lawmakers have also proposed an estimated $25 billion to boost domestic semiconductor production. These investments aim to make the U.S. semiconductor industry highly competitive in the global markets.
The strong demand and improving supply conditions should allow the chip industry to generate substantial growth over the long term. Thus, we think shares of established companies in this space, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), and  Qualcomm Inc .

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks closed at a record on Monday and U.S. Treasury yields held above five-month lows touched last week as investors looked for signs on whether the Delta variant of the COVID-19 coronavirus could hamper economic growth. 
Last week, a bond market rally pushed the yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a five-month low of 1.25% as investors worried that climbing cases of the variant could slow the economic recovery. The yield had risen to as high as 1.78% in March as rising vaccination rates fed expectations for growth. 
The World Health Organization warned the Delta variant was becoming dominant and many countries had yet to receive enough doses of vaccine to secure their health workers.
Analysts also cited a lack of supply for the drop in yields. Yields were little changed after Treasury sold $58 billion in three-year notes and $38 billion in 10-year notes, with a sale of $24 billion in 30-year bonds set for Tuesday.
Earnings season begins this week, and the market will take in U.S. inflation data on consumer and producer prices as well as comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Equity gains on Wall Street were modest, with financials the best-performing S&P sector of the session ahead of results from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Tuesday, but the gains were enough to push each of the three major averages to record closing levels.

Investing.com – The three major averages closed at record highs as investors looked ahead to the quarterly earnings from major banks as catalyst for further direction.  
The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to close at a record of 4,384.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4%, or 126 points to a record close, just shy of the 35,000 level, while the Nasdaq gained 0.2% to new closing record of 14,733.24.
A slew of major Wall Street banks are set to kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reporting earnings on Tuesday.
The second-quarter wasn't a particularly good quarter for banks against a backdrop of falling interest rates and subdued loan demand compared with a year earlier as consumers are awash with cash.
“For this quarter [Q2], I don't think the banks are going to report substantial loan growth this quarter, at least from the numbers that we're looking at that's put out by the St. Louis Fed,” George Cipolloni a portfolio manager of Penn Mutual Asset Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Monday. “The market might like the announcement of share repurchase from the banks, which could help support the banks through this quarter, even though I don't think we'll get loan growth yet,"" he added.
Guidance from banks that points to improving net loan to deposit growth will be a key driver to boost investor appetite on banks. “If that dynamic were to change, that would be great for GDP, it would support inflation and higher yields, Cipolloni added. if we see a change net loan to deposit ratio, we'd be very happy with that particular outcome regarding banks,” Cipolloni added.
In tech, semiconductor names helped keep the broader the sector above water following weakness in some of the megacap tech names. 
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX)  and ASML Holding NV ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) were among the top gainers with latter up more than 2%.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were lower, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were above the flatline.

On the economic front, this week is set to be a market-moving week, with the release of inflation data on Tuesday, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set to take stand before Congress on Wednesday.  
Still, some warn the influx of incoming economic and corporate data as well as potential clues on monetary policy could spark volatile into life.

Investing.com -- Investors piled into bank stocks ahead of this week’s earnings from the biggest of the group, pushing the broad market to another record high.
The S&P 500 surged on Monday, as did the other indexes. Banks are seen as a beneficiary of a reopening economy, though the comparisons to last year’s robust trading activity could be challenging. Low interest rates also cut into bank profit from lending.
On the economic front, the government will release the June readings of inflation trends on Tuesday, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify before Congress starting on Wednesday.
Over the weekend, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE:SPCE) founder Richard Branson completed a successful test flight of his space vehicle, setting the stage for the opening of space tourism in the near future. Virgin Galactic shares fell 14% on Monday after the company announced a share sale.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is scheduled to take a flight to the edge of space on his own rocket, through his space company Blue Origin, next week.
As companies kick off earnings this week, here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Big bank earnings
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)is expected to report earnings on Tuesday, and analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per shares of $3.16 on revenue of $30 billion. Rival investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which also reports its second quarter on Tuesday, is expected to announce EPS of $9.96 on revenue of $12.04 billion.
2. More earnings
PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)Is expected to report EPS of $1.53 a share on revenue of $17.97 billion. More than half the analysts who follow the soft drink and snack maker rate the stock a buy, with an average price target of $156, which is 5% higher than its current level.
3. Inflation data
The consumer price index for June is expected to have risen by an annual rate of 4.9%, a trifle lower than May’s 5%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report will release the numbers Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
The core inflation rate in the U.S., which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to have climbed 4% in June from a year ago against 3.8% run-up in May, which was then the quickest pace of increase since May 1992.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Monday it is turning to a German parts supplier to make the initial, small production run of its new electric commercial van in a move to get the vehicle quickly into the hands of customer Fedex.
The decision to use Kuka AG to build the EV600 vans is not typical in the industry. But it shows the No. 1 U.S. automaker's desire to stick to a plan to roll out the vehicle in late 2021, said Travis Katz, chief executive of GM's BrightDrop commercial van business.
""We are working alongside Kuka for initial low-volume production to keep up with market demand and remain on track to deliver our first EV600 order later this year,"" Katz said in a statement to Reuters. 
GM announced the BrightDrop commercial van business in January. 
""They just want to get them going,"" Mike Van Boekel, chairman of Unifor Local 88, which represents about 1,500 hourly workers at GM's CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, that will ultimately build the van, said of the decision to use Kuka. ""The orders are coming through so strong."" 
Kuka declined to comment. 
GM said in June it would end production of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV at CAMI next April and begin production of the electric van there in November 2022 before increasing the number of shifts building it to two in 2023 and three in 2024. It also said it was ""working with supplier partners"" to meet its timetable.
Kuka's production run will number fewer than 500 hand-built models and begin in late October at the supplier's plant in Livonia, Michigan, according to the three sources who asked not to be identified and GM documents. 
""It is unusual. They want to show they can do this quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""However, they don't have the plant (in Canada) ready because they're still building Equinoxes."" 
GM previously said it would invest $800 million in the Canadian plant for the large van's production. 
The electric commercial van business is attractive because governments in China and Europe are pushing companies to slash CO2 emissions, and companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) have pledged to shift their large delivery fleets to EVs. 
In addition, EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has not cracked the market, and it has become a race for companies like GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Stellantis, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and startups Rivian, Arrival and Electric Last Mile Solutions to introduce their EV delivery vans.
GM has estimated the U.S. market for parcel and food delivery vehicles will climb to more than $850 billion by 2025. 
In January, GM's shares surged after Chief Executive Mary Barra announced the company's entry to the growing electric delivery vehicle business, with plans to begin shipping the first BrightDrop vans to FedEx later this year. GM said then the first 500 units would be shipped to FedEx by year end, with deliveries to other customers starting in early 2022. 

GM's EV600 will use a version of its own Ultium battery system that will power many of its future EVs. It will have a driving range of 250 miles (400 km) between charges.
Last month, GM boosted its spending on electric and autonomous vehicles by about 30% to $35 billion and accelerated plans for two U.S. battery cell plants.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high Monday, led by financials as investors piled into banking stocks ahead of their earnings later this week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a record high of 4,384.90. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.31%, or 107 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.08%. 
A slew of major Wall Street banks are set to kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reporting earnings on Tuesday.
The second-quarter wasn't a particularly good quarter for banks against a backdrop of falling interest rates and subdued loan demand compared with a year earlier as consumers are awash with cash.
“For this quarter [Q2], I don't think the banks are going to report substantial loan growth this quarter, at least from the numbers that we're looking at that's put out by the St. Louis Fed,” George Cipolloni a portfolio manager of Penn Mutual Asset Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Monday. “The market might like the announcement of share repurchase from the banks, which could help support the banks through this quarter, even though I don't think we'll get loan growth yet,"" he added.
Any guidance from banks that points to improving net loan to deposit growth will be a key driver to boost investor appetite on banks. “If that dynamic were to change, that would be great for GDP, it would support inflation and higher yields, Cipolloni added. if we see a change net loan to deposit ratio, we'd be very happy with that particular outcome regarding banks,” Cipolloni added.
The bid up in financials and other cyclical stocks appeared to come at the expense of the broader growth sector as tech pared some its gains, though remained in the green thanks to a climb in semiconductor stocks.
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX)  and ASML Holding NV ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) were among the top gainers with latter up more than 2%.
Megacap tech, meanwhile, traded mostly lower.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were lower, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were above the flatline.

This, along with a fast-paced reopening of infrastructure activities after a prolonged pause, should benefit infrastructure companies  Johnson Controls  (NYSE:JCI) and Jacobs Engineering (J) in the coming months. But read on to learn which of these stocks is a better buy now.Johnson Controls International plc (JCI) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J) are two important players in the engineering and construction industry. JCI is an Ireland-based company that provides building products and technology solutions, offering air systems, building management, HVAC controls, security, and fire safety solutions. J offers interior construction management, scientific research and testing, architecture, engineering, and operations and maintenance services. J is based in Pasadena, Calif. Both companies serve industrial, commercial, and governmental clients worldwide.
With an overall grade of C-minus for the quality of U.S. infrastructure given by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), President Biden proposed $1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending over he next eight years will be used to repair and rebuild water conduits, roads and bridges, build EV charging stations, upgrade broadband infrastructure and support renewable energy to achieve long-term sustainability goals. Because the bipartisan infrastructure plan is expected to be voted on in the U.S. Senate soon, investors are now focusing on the infrastructure sector. Moreover, rising infrastructure activities with the reopening of the economy and increasing demand for smart building technology and design services are buoying investor sentiment about the industry’s growth prospects. The global construction market is expected to grow at a 3.5% CAGR to reach $14.4 trillion by 2026. So, with that, we believe both JCI and J should benefit substantially in the coming months.
While J lost 4.9% over the past month, JCI surged 4.8%. And in terms of past nine months’ performance, JCI is a clear winner with 63% gains versus J’s 35.6% returns. So, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Consequently, Wall Street analysts have recently upgraded their ratings of these two stocks. Read on.The capital markets have been buoyant since early 2021, driven by the fast-paced macroeconomic recovery.

U.S. IPOs hit an annual record of $171 billion less than six months into the year, as of June 15.
Furthermore, rising consumer and corporate borrowing in the ultra-low-interest-rate environment has driven increased loan business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said on Monday it will vote July 21 on whether to rescind a 1995 policy statement regarding “prior approval” and “prior notice” remedies in merger cases.
The FTC said in 1995 it would no longer require prior approval of certain future acquisitions in such orders as a routine matter. 
But the FTC's commissioner at that time, Mary Azcuenaga, objected to the agency's decision to abandon the longstanding policy. She noted that the ""prior approval requirement is imposed only on firms that have attempted unlawful acquisitions"" and argued it was ""less costly than a new investigation of a proposed transaction and a second challenge under the law.""

Separately, the FTC will vote on a proposed policy statement on repair restrictions imposed by manufacturers and sellers after the FTC in May issued a report on ""Right to Repair"" issues that impact mobile phones, home appliances, cars, farm equipment and many other consumer products.
President Joe Biden, in an executive signed on Friday that is designed to boost competition, singled out repair restrictions that bar farmers from being able to make software-related repairs to tractors as an issue the FTC should address.

Investing.com – Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)stock rose 1% on a report in The Wall Street Journal the chipmaker is in talks to buy closely-held software firm SAS for an enterprise value of anywhere between $15 billion and $20 billion.
A deal hasn't yet been reached and the talks could go either way, according to the WSJ report.  
Broadcom, a semiconductor powerhouse built largely through acquisitions, has been looking for more deals since former President Donald Trump blocked its quest to buy rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in 2018, citing security risks. Broadcom has since moved its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore.  
Cary, N.C.-based SAS sells analytics, business-intelligence and data-management software. It traces its roots back to the 1960s, when universities teamed up to analyze troves of agricultural data through a program called the Statistical Analysis System, according to its website.
The company has more 12,000 employees and customers around the world. It is still run by co-founders Jim Goodnight and John Sall.
Earlier this month, the antitrust regulator accused Broadcom of monopolizing the market for semiconductor components.
It ordered “the semiconductor supplier to cease its anticompetitive conduct.""
The complaint says Broadcom illegally maintains its power by entering into long-term agreements with both OEMs and service providers, thus preventing these customers from purchasing chips from Broadcom’s competitors."

Earlier, Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) said Porter was the mystery buyer behind an order of up to 80 E195-E2 jets, a deal previously announced in May. Porter placed an order to buy a record 30 jets and options for 50 more, for a total value of $5.82 billion based on list prices, Embraer said.
Embraer shares were up 6% in early afternoon trade in Sao Paulo.

""It certainly will be highly competitive,"" Deluce said in an interview.
Like their global peers, Canadian carriers were battered during the pandemic with flights plummeting due to strict travel restrictions. But the pandemic also led to growth opportunities, including lowering the cost of acquiring planes.
""The pandemic created opportunities on acquisition that were not available before,"" Deluce said, without giving details on pricing. ""We were looking at various growth plans, but I think the specifics really emerged during the pandemic.""
United Airlines in late June announced its largest-ever order for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets in a push for post-pandemic growth.
Porter is restarting flights on Sept. 8 after suspending travel for nearly 18 months. The carrier operates 29 DeHavilland Dash 8-400 turboprops and competes by offering perks like free beverages and snacks, at a time when rivals are moving toward charging for onboard services.
But while the fuel-efficient turboprops help Porter lower costs, their limited range capped the airline's growth potential. 
The E195-E2 jets would allow Porter to fly to new U.S. Mexican and Caribbean destinations from Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal, although new routes have not yet been announced. The jets will enter service starting in the second half of 2022.

Embraer has orders for up to 280 E195-E2 planes, a mix of firm orders and options.
Porter will be Embraer's first North American customer for the E2 line.

And primarily restaurants in the fast-food industry have been able to stay in business and generate profits by implementing heightened hygienic measures, online delivery, and drive-throughs.
But, although fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has managed to gain significant ground over the past year, the stock has been losing its momentum lately on concerns over the company's growth prospects. While CMG’s revenue increased 23.5% to $1.74 billion in the first quarter of 2021, its operating expenses surged 18% to $1.58 billion. In addition, the company closed five of its restaurants in the first quarter. And CMG’s recent menu price hike by roughly 4%, to cover the cost of raising its workers’ wages has piqued investors’ concerns.
In contrast, McDonald’s Corporation(MCD), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH), and The Wendy’s Corporation (WEN) are better positioned to take advantage of the rising demand for indoor dining given that nearly 50% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Since these companies have plenty of room for growth, we believe their stocks could be solid bets now in contrast to CMG’s.

Furthermore, with the help of new technology, the industry has been making tremendous progress in developing treatments for many previously incurable ailments. Against this backdrop, we believe two significantly undervalued biotech stocks—Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN)—are positioned nicely to deliver solid returns owing to the companies’ continued innovation and strong financials.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Walmart Inc-owned Flipkart on Monday ushered back SoftBank Group Corp as an investor in a $3.6 billion funding round, doubling the Indian online retailer's valuation to $37.6 billion in less than three years and ahead of its expected market debut.
The U.S. retail giant bought a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018 and since then has expanded to small towns and cities, added more items such as furniture and grocery to its online store and increased its warehouses in its race with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s India unit.
The Bengaluru-based company is aiming for a $50 billion valuation for its public listing as early as this year and was in talks in the United States for a deal with a blank-check firm, Reuters reported in March.
About $800 million of the latest funding came from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. GIC, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were also among the lead investors. 
""SoftBank's re-investment in Flipkart is driven by our experience with and conviction in the company's management team to continue addressing the needs of the Indian consumer in the decades to come,"" Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said.
SoftBank had sold its roughly 20% stake to Walmart as part of the 2018 deal. 
Like Amazon, Flipkart began by selling books but diversified rapidly into selling smartphones, clothing and other items. It has benefited from India's rapid smartphone adoption and cheap mobile data that helped propel growth at digital startups. 
The new capital will be used to expand operations and invest further in the company's grocery, fashion and last-mile delivery programs, Flipkart said, adding it currently has more than 350 million registered users. 
""It is a triumph for Walmart as investors were initially skeptical of the U.S. retailer's tie-up with Flipkart,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group.
He added the success of Flipkart bolsters India as a destination for foreign investment. 
Several Indian startups have spelt out plans to go public to cash in on liquidity by foreign funds. Some closely watched include food delivery startup Zomato, payments services Paytm, beauty brand Nykaa and ride-hailing service Ola.

Twenty-two companies have debuted this year as of July 9. There were $3.6 billion worth of IPOs in India in the first half of 2021, up from $1.1 billion at the same time last year, according to Refinitiv data. 
The level so far this year is the highest since 2008.

Investing.com – Meme stock Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) fell more than 3% in Monday’s trading after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Lisa Gill cut her price target to $9 due to a “less compelling” risk-reward ratio.
The weakness in shares took it below Gill’s latest target.
Clover lowered most guidance metrics, including reducing the number of aligned beneficiaries under the direct contracting program in 2021 by 50%, Gill wrote in her note.
The analyst thinks shares of larger, more diversified rivals in the managed care business offer a better balance of risk-rewards, given Clover's reduced visibility into near-term risks. These include a rebound in post-pandemic medical utilization, uncertainty in aligned beneficiary growth and a pause in the direct contracting program.
For fiscal 2021, Clover expects total revenue to be between $810 million and $830 million, inclusive of a preliminary estimate of approximately $20 million to $30 million of revenue generated from direct contracting.
A normalized adjusted loss in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is seen between $240 million and $190 million. The company will disclose its second quarter earnings on August 11.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -A World Health Organization (WHO) committee said on Monday that human genome editing technologies to treat serious disease should be shared more generously, to allow poorer nations to benefit from the highly dynamic scientific field.
""WHO should work with others to encourage relevant patent holders to help ensure equitable access to human genome editing interventions,"" the 18-member committee said in a report, which covered a wide range of governance structures and processes.
The panel of gene editing experts was established in late 2018 after a Chinese scientist said he had edited the genes of twin babies to make then resistant to HIV infection.
Underlining the WHO's existing stance, the report strongly opposed making modifications to the genetic code in humans that would be passed on to future generations, known as heritable germline genome editing.
""No-one in their right mind should contemplate doing it because the techniques are simply not safe enough or efficient enough and we're not ready in terms of looking at all the ethical considerations,"" said Robin Lovell Badge of Britain's Francis Crick Institute, a committee member.
But the technology, with the CRISPR/Cas9 'genetic scissors' as its most prominent tool, also holds the promise of curing diseases such as HIV or sickle-cell disease and boosting fundamental medical knowledge, and unequal access could cement global disparities, the panel warned.
""The danger in fully implementing intellectual property as we know it,"" would be that rich countries benefit while poor countries bear the main burden of diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, Anne Wangari Thairu-Muigai of Kenja's Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, told a press briefing.
Intellectual property in medicine became a contested issue when U.S. President Joe Biden in May proposed a temporary waiver of vaccine patents to make anti-COVID-19 shots more quickly available in low-income countries.
Pharmaceutical companies and other countries have argued such a step would be ineffective and risks discouraging work on future health technologies.

Seeking to head off irresponsible human gene modification, the panel also warned it should only be conducted where sufficient policies and oversight are in place, raising the spectre of rogue clinics attracting medical tourism to loosely regulated countries with purported therapies or clinical trials.
Specific rules, however, could be a while in the making as WHO said its Science Division would be given up to 3 years to initiate an extensive review of the recommendations, while the review itself could take as long as 18 months.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",MSP Recovery to go public via nearly $33 billion mega SPAC deal,"By Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - MSP Recovery, which helps recover money from Medicare and Medicaid secondary payments, will go public through a deal with a blank-check firm, giving the combined company an enterprise value of $32.6 billion in the second biggest SPAC merger.
The deal with Lionheart Acquisition Corp II is expected to fetch $230 million in proceeds for MSP, it said on Monday. https://refini.tv/3wuAoOV
MSP, led by billionaire entrepreneur John Ruiz, collects and analyzes data on the government-backed Medicare and Medicaid insurance claims, and then helps recover money owed to its clients, which include hospitals, health insurers and medical providers.
""Medicare and Medicaid pay billions of dollars of healthcare claims they should not pay. This harms taxpayers, the underprivileged, and America's senior citizens,"" Ruiz said. 
""Our tools help fix this broken system.""
Medicare Advantage plans cater to Americans older than 65 and those with disabilities. 
The Florida-based company, founded in 2014, earns a fee after a successful recovery. The Lionheart deal will help MSP quickly buy claims portfolios, while further growing its data-analytics capabilities, it said. 
Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public through a merger at a later date.
Lionheart raised $230 million in an initial public offering in August. The company's shares were up 5.2% at $10.40 in trading before the bell.
At $32.6 billion, the merger is second in size only to the nearly $40 billion deal inked in April between Southeast Asia's Grab and Altimeter Growth Corp.
The MSP deal is also the largest since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was considering new rules to protect investors amid a surge in the use of SPACs as capital-raising vehicles.
It also pointed to a rebound in merger activity in the blank-check space after Wall Street's appetite showed signs of waning following a period of frenetic deal-making using the investment vehicle. 
In the past few months, biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks and SoftBank-backed mortgage startup Better HoldCo have announced multi-billion dollar deals with blank-check vehicles.
Lionheart stockholders who do not redeem shares of its common stock will be issued more than 1 billion warrants in connection with the merger, the company said. 
MSP's founders will sell an equivalent number of their shares back to the company so that the provision won't dilute the stock's value. 
MSP will list its stock on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MSPR"". Its existing and additional warrants will trade as ""LCAP W"", and ""MSPR W"", respectively. 

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods served as the financial adviser to MSP, while Nomura Securities advised Lionheart. 
The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's antitrust regulator is set to order the music streaming arm of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd to give up exclusive rights to music labels which it has used to compete with smaller rivals, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) will also fine it 500,000 yuan ($77,150) for lapses in reporting the acquisitions of apps Kuwo and Kugou, the people told Reuters - a milder penalty than the forced sale indicated earlier this year.
SAMR, Tencent Holdings and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The move is the latest in a clamp-down to curb the economic and social power of China's once-loosely regulated internet giants. The campaign, which began late last year, has included a record 18 billion yuan fine on e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd for abusing its market position.
In April, Reuters reported that SAMR aimed to fine Tencent Holdings at least 10 billion yuan, and that the social media leader was lobbying for leniency. Reuters also reported that SAMR had told Tencent Music it may have to sell Kuwo and Kugou.
Instead, SAMR will no longer require a sale but will impose the maximum 500,000 yuan fine for not properly flagging the 2016 app purchases for antitrust review, the people said on Monday.
""Personally, I think this punishment falls short and is even a boon for Tencent. The acquisitions obviously would restrict competition in the market, and should have been vetoed,"" said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices.
""It is too little a hit to Tencent Music's dominant position in the market,"" said You, a commentator on antitrust law.
Reuters could not determine whether Tencent Holdings faces any further antitrust penalty beyond the expected ruling on Tencent Music, China's dominant music streamer.
On Saturday, SAMR said it would block Tencent Holdings' plan to merge China's two biggest videogame streamers - Huya (NYSE:HUYA) Inc and  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) Ltd - on antitrust grounds, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
EXCLUSIVITY
Tencent Music, China's equivalent to  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), had been pursuing exclusive streaming rights with labels including Universal Music Group,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp to fend off competition.
It became the subject of a SAMR investigation in 2018 which stopped the following year after the company agreed not to renew some of its exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, Reuters previously reported.
It nevertheless kept exclusive rights to music from some acts, including Jay Chou, one of the Chinese-speaking world's most influential artists.
After SAMR's latest ruling, Tencent Music will at least be able to retain rights to music from some domestic indie acts, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Losing exclusive rights means Tencent Music will likely have to redouble efforts to build a more interactive and lively community to engage with its users. The firm has also been diversifying its content through long-form shows and live talk shows to attract more paying users as well as advertisers.

Tencent Music is facing a mounting challenge from ByteDance, which is using its Douyin app - its Chinese version of TikTok - to promote music backed by sophisticated algorithms.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week mixed on Monday, as concerns about the global spread of the Covid-19 virus encouraged further rotation out of value stocks and back into the 'growth-oriented' stocks that benefited so much from the pandemic last year.
Even so, they remained close to record highs at the start of a week that will feature testimony from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, U.S. inflation data for June and the start of the second-quarter earnings season.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT). the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 113 points, or 0.3%, at 34,757 points, while the S&P 500, which had finished last week at a record high, was down 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite, which likewise closed at a record high on Friday, extended that streak with a 0.3% gain. 
The U.S. recorded its highest number of new Covid-19 cases in over two months at the weekend, prompting fears that the highly-transmissible delta strain of the virus may yet derail economic reopening, especially in those state with low vaccination rates. The U.S. vaccination rate has tailed off sharply since April and is currently running at one-tenth of its peak rate, despite the fact that less than half of the adult population is fully vaccinated.
For many, though, that's still only a cloud on the horizon that may or may not blow their way. The gradual return to normal life was illustrated at the weekend by  Disney 's new blockbuster Black Widow raking in $218 million at the box office, including over $150 million from reopened movie theaters. Analysts were more impressed by the $60 million it made through the Disney+ streaming channel, where it earns higher margins. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)stock outperformed with a 0.9% gain.
Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock followed its founder Richard Branson in returning to earth after a brief stratospheric rise in the overnight session. The stock fell 8.7% after investors took profit on a trade driven by anticipation of the company's first full-crew test flight on Sunday, leaving it some 25% below the record high it hit after Branson announced the flight date earlier in the year.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)stock rose 2.7% as some bet on a speedy exoneration for CEO Elon Musk at a much-delayed trial in a Delaware Court, where he faces charges of defrauding Tesla investors by overpaying for solar panel business SolarCity back in 2016. 
Chinese American Depositary Receipts remained under pressure after further signs of the Communist Party taming the country's big Internet firms. Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) ADRs fell 3.1% after the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of 25 more apps owned by the ride-hailing giant from local app stores. The company acknowledged this would hurt its revenue in China. Meanwhile, Tencent Music Entertainment ADRs (NYSE:TME) fell 3.4% to their lowest in five weeks after reports that antitrust regulators want it to give up certain exclusive rights to music.
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), TME's largest shareholder, also fell 2.5% after antitrust regulators stopped it from orchestrating a merger between two of its affiliates, on the grounds that it would create too much concentration in the videogaming sector."

Producer are consolidating in U.S. shale as oil and natural gas prices recover from last year's pandemic swoon and this month traded at multi-year highs. Smaller producers also are snapping up unwanted properties in a bet on continued demand for oil and gas while some big oil companies shift their acquisition emphasis to renewables.
Total value of the 40 reported deals last quarter was $33 billion, estimated energy data provider Enverus Inc, up from $44.5 billion for all of last year.

""There is still a lot of activity out there,"" said Dittmar, citing recovering share prices and the number of private-equity backed firms looking to sell. ""Public companies are not done consolidating"" smaller, closely-held producers, he said. 
""If commodity prices stay strong, we'll see a fairly active rest of the year,"" Dittmar said. 
A number of top oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) are considering or have put U.S. oil properties on the market due to rising buyer interest.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) -Hungary has offered to buy Budapest Airport from its foreign shareholders, part of an effort to take it back into state hands and protect what the government says are national interests. 
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government earlier this year expressed its interest in buying a majority stake in Hungary's main international airport saying its past privatisation had been against the country's ""strategic interests"".
Orban, a nationalist often at loggerheads with the European Commission on a range of issues, has said he wants to see the airport in domestic hands, but until now its owners have expressed no interest in selling it. Since Orban took power in 2010, his government has boosted Hungarian ownership in strategic sectors such as energy, banking, and the media.
The biggest shareholder in Budapest Airport with 55.44% is AviAlliance GmbH, formerly Hochtief AirPort GmbH, owned by Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments). 
AviAlliance GmbH said on Monday it had received an offer from the Hungarian government which it had not asked for.
""We can confirm that the Hungarian Government submitted a non-binding offer to the shareholders of Budapest Airport. In the interest of our co-shareholders and on legal grounds we are obliged to review potential offers,"" AviAlliance said in an emailed reply to Reuters questions.
""Nonetheless, this NBO was not initiated by us. AviAlliance is a committed long-term investor ... We deeply hope to be given the opportunity to remain invested in this airport.""
Singapore's GIC Special Investments and Canada's Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) each hold a little over 21%.
CDPQ declined to comment and GIC was not immediately available to comment.
The Hungarian government would like to acquire a majority stake in Budapest Airport again through negotiations with the owners, the Innovation and Technology Ministry told Reuters in a statement, adding it was ""strategically important to have the airport in Hungarian hands again"".
Orban's government has expanded state ownership in several sectors since he took office in 2010.
The state currently has no stake in the airport, which was privatised in 2005.
In an interview last month, Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics, who has been put in charge of the airport deal, told website vasarnap.hu that acquiring the airport was key to relaunching tourism after the pandemic, and criticised its owners for not investing enough in the quality of services at the airport.
Budapest Airport is a fast-growing, medium-sized airport that has benefited from a boom in low-cost travel, but is facing a difficult market due to the pandemic.

AviAlliance, which holds interests in five airports including Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Athens, said like all European airports, Budapest has been severely affected by COVID-19. 
""Yet, we continued our investments in the airport's infrastructure and operation during the current crisis as we believe in its fast economic recovery and long-term growth potential,"" it said.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 09:26AM ET</span>","Analysis - Pfizer/BioNTech bid for booster doses premature, more data needed - experts","By Julie Steenhuysen and Michael Erman
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s push for health regulators to authorize a third dose of its COVID-19 shot is not yet backed by evidence, despite the fast-spreading Delta variant, vaccine experts said. 
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said last week that they will ask U.S. and European regulators within weeks to authorize a booster dose due to an increased risk of infection after six months. 
The companies did not share the data showing that risk, but said it would soon be made public. A meeting with federal health officials to discuss the matter was scheduled for Monday, Pfizer said.
In interviews with Reuters, some leading vaccine experts questioned Pfizer's rationale and said that more data was needed to justify a booster, especially as many countries struggle to administer the initial vaccine doses needed to protect their citizens. 
""It's disappointing that with such a complicated decision they took such a unilateral approach,"" said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who is overseeing U.S.-government backed COVID-19 vaccine trials. 
The rise of the Delta variant, first detected in India and now the dominant form of new coronavirus infections in many countries, has raised concerns over whether currently available vaccines offer enough protection. Several experts say a booster shot would be warranted if there is a substantial increase in hospitalizations or deaths among vaccinated people. 
""That's the line for boosters,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and an advisor on vaccines to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
That has not been the case so far in the United States, where the overwhelming majority of severe illness occurs in unvaccinated people, he said. 
Shortly after Pfizer's announcement late on Thursday, U.S. health officials sought to reassure the public that anyone who already received two doses of the drugmaker's vaccine was protected against severe disease and death, even from the Delta variant. 
""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
A Pfizer spokesperson declined to comment on the criticism. 
ISRAELI FINDINGS
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla and other officials have said for months that they expect a regular booster shot will be needed against COVID-19, a prospect that could help company profits for years to come.
In explaining the decision to seek emergency authorization now, Pfizer cited findings released last week by Israel's Health Ministry suggesting the vaccine was only 64% effective at preventing transmission and mild disease in the face of the Delta variant. The ministry said it remains 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations and death. 
Pfizer's chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, told Reuters the Israeli data showed that protection had waned in individuals who got the vaccine in January or February. 
Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb told CNBC that those vaccinated included people who are older and who had experienced asymptomatic or mild COVID. 
""Frankly you do not want them to get any infection because of the uncertainty of infection in older individuals and how dangerous infection is in older individuals,"" he said. ""That's why I believe ... boosters will likely be an option for older individuals who were vaccinated a while ago heading into the fall and winter.""
The Israeli Health Ministry, however, has not published any data showing a specific correlation between infections among vaccinated people and the date the vaccine was administered. On Sunday, the government said it would offer a booster to adults with weak immune systems who are at higher risk for severe COVID.
""I am not aware of valid clinical evidence coming from Israel that establishes a higher risk of breakthrough infection, let alone severe illness, associated with six months or more elapsing from vaccination - not in a methodologically sound analysis suggesting causal association beyond early descriptive hints,"" said Ran Balicer of healthcare provider HMO Clalit and chair of the Israeli government's expert advisory panel on COVID-19.
""I am not saying it could not be the case - but that to date I have not seen such evidence,"" he said.
It is not clear at this point what might be causing the drop in efficacy, Corey said. ""Is it really due to waning antibody levels, or is it something else?""
The U.S. government is backing two studies of a similar vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc that could shed more light on how the vaccines fare against the Delta variant. Those results are expected in late fall.

Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he was encouraged by statements from Pfizer that the company's own preliminary data show a third vaccine dose produces a fresh spike in antibody levels, in case it will be needed. 
""But the argument for a booster right now, I don't find compelling,"" he said.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",Founding family plan $1.1 billion bid to take Daily Mail owner private,"By Muvija M and Paul Sandle
(Reuters) -The founding family and leading investor in the publisher of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper is considering taking the group private in a $1.1 billion deal as part of a break-up of the business.
The Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) said the Rothermeres, who own 28% of the company, are ready to make a cash offer to buy the group outright, provided it sells its RMS insurance risk business and that the listing of online car seller Cazoo, which it partially owns, goes ahead.
Shares in DMGT, which publishes the Daily Mail tabloid, The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, climbed as much as 10% to their highest in more than two decades in early trading. They were up 3.3% at 1,074 pence at 1240 GMT.
The Daily Mail was first published in 1896 by the ancestors of current DMGT chairman Jonathan Harmsworth, the Viscount Rothermere.
The Mail has weathered the long-term decline in newspaper sales better than rivals, overtaking Rupert Murdoch's Sun to become the UK's top-selling newspaper last year, and wields political clout as the voice of conservative ""middle England"".
The group's website - MailOnline - is among the most visited English-language news sites globally thanks to its celebrity focused formula.
DMGT, which has been slimming down in the last few years to focus on its mainstay news business, said on Monday it was in talks to sell RMS in a deal that could complete before the end of September.
Without its interests in Cazoo and RMS - which offers risk-modeling for businesses - DMGT would comprise news publishing and its events and property information businesses.
DMGT said it intended to distribute the proceeds of a sale of RMS along with its cash and its stake in a listed Cazoo via a special dividend, with a cash element of about 610 pence.
The company's stake in Cazoo could be worth $1.35 billion after the flotation, expected in the current quarter.
Contingent on the transactions, the Rothermeres would be prepared to offer 251 pence for each DMGT share, DMGT said.
Analysts at Berenberg said the approximate value of the terms implied a value per share of 1,261 pence, a 21% premium on Friday's closing price.
""The premium doesn't represent a knock out offer, but given the Rothermere holding company already controls the group, there aren't really other alternatives, and versus the share price of DMGT earlier in the year, it's obviously very significant upside,"" they said. 

""Its unlikely, therefore, that we will see a much more generous offer appear from elsewhere."" 
DMGT's liquidity has been constrained by its dual-share structure, with voting rights only granted to some stock, tightening the family's hold on the company.

Investing.com – Shares of major banks were trading weaker as bond yields drifted lower in Monday’s premarket trading, a day before they kick off the second-quarter earnings season.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were all trading lower by 0.4%-0.7% as the market prepares for most to announce their earnings this week.
The outlook for bank earnings has been hit by the marked drop in bond yields in recent weeks, as fears of the economic rebound flattening out have overshadowed concerns about high inflation. Falling bond yields depress banks' lending margins and consequently their profitability.
A big reason behind the fresh skepticism has been the coronavirus’ rapidly-spreading Delta variant. New cases of infection and deaths have again been on the upswing in parts of U.S., the U.K. and Europe, as well as southeast Asia.
The yield on the United States 30-Year Treasury bond has traded below 2% again lately, ruling mostly flat at 1.97% at 8.40am ET today. The United States 10-Year benchmark was 1 basis point lower at 1.34%.
The yield on the United States 5-Year, more sensitive to expectations of short-term interest rate changes, was also down a basis point at 0.77%.  
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. Bond yields and prices are inversely related.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>","Analysis: Dealmakers see M&A rush, then chills, in Biden's antitrust crackdown","By David French and Sierra Jackson
(Reuters) - Dealmakers expect a new wave of transformative U.S. mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as companies rush to complete deals before President Joe Biden's antitrust push takes shape, to be followed by a slowdown when regulators start cracking down.
Biden signed a sweeping executive order on Friday to bolster competition within the U.S. economy. This included a call for regulatory agencies to increase scrutiny of corporate tie-ups which have left major sectors such as technology and healthcare dominated by few players.
The order came amid an unprecedented M&A frenzy, as companies borrow cheaply and spend mountains of cash they have accumulated on transformative deals to reposition themselves for the post-pandemic world. Almost $700 billion worth of U.S. deals were announced in the second quarter, the highest on record.
The dealmaking bonanza is set to continue, as companies seek to take advantage of the time window during which regulators frame precise rules to implement Biden's order, advisers to the companies said. The M&A slowdown will come only when regulators implement the rule changes, possibly in two years or more, they added.
""The order itself will be less likely to have a chilling effect on strategic M&A than the potential chilling effect of a significant increase in the number of prolonged investigations and merger challenges brought by the agencies,"" said Michael Schaper, partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.
Spokespeople for the White House and the two main antitrust regulators, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dealmakers were bracing for a tougher antitrust environment under Biden even before last week's executive order. Last month, the DoJ sued to stop insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON)'s $30 billion acquisition of peer Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW). And Biden tapped Lina Khan, an antitrust researcher who has focused her work on Big Tech's immense market power, to chair the FTC.
Alongside the acting head of the DoJ's antitrust division, Richard Powers, Khan said on Friday they would soon launch a review of merger guidelines to determine if they are ""overly permissive.""
""(Khan)'s already done a great deal to make clear that there's a new sheriff in town, and her appointment is a signal that the administration, at least the FTC, is looking for some very aggressive action,"" said Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School.
INVESTMENT FIRMS COULD ALSO TAKE A HIT
The White House said Friday's executive order was aimed at corporate monopolies across a broad swath of industries, and included 72 initiatives which President Biden wants more than a dozen federal agencies to act on.
Private equity firms, which face little antitrust scrutiny in their acquisitions, could benefit from this trend when they acquire companies, dealmakers said. But they and venture capital firms could take a hit when they try to sell companies they have invested in to competitors and peers in their sector.
""My fear is the only one that this is going to hurt is the startup and the venture capitalists who are developing technology that suddenly no longer can sell that to its natural acquirer,"" said Louis Lehot, partner at Foley & Lardner LLP.
One area that is poised for special scrutiny are vertical mergers, where a company buys a supplier or someone to which it sells a product. Such tie-ups have been attracting heightened regulatory attention in recent years, especially for technology firms that own both the platform and the content that they host.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s $8.5 billion proposed acquisition of movie studio MGM is an example of such a vertical merger. A source told Reuters on Friday the transaction was headed for an extended probe by the FTC.
""There has already been attention to vertical merger issues at the FTC and DOJ, but I suspect there may be more enhanced review of vertical issues or a different type of review of vertical mergers,"" said James Fishkin, partner at law firm Dechert.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 08:26AM ET</span>","Analysis: JPMorgan, Goldman bet on tech to crack UK consumer market","By Anna Irrera and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) are taking on a consumer finance market many outsiders have tried and failed to crack: Britain.
    The two are testing the UK market to see if their U.S. retail brands, Chase and Marcus, can be rolled out globally. The challenge, analysts say, is scraping some business from customers who are entrenched with local providers.
    Success hinges on whether they can deliver slicker technology and more attractive pricing than incumbents. Six lenders dominate the UK retail arena: Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) PLC, NatWest Group PLC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC, HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC, Banco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) and Nationwide Building Society.
It will be difficult, analysts said, because customers tend to have sticky relationships with banks. Transferring money or opening additional accounts can seem too much of a hassle.
""The length of time it takes to build up a franchise in the UK is easily underestimated,"" said Goodbody banking analyst John Cronin. ""It takes years.""
JPMorgan has already bolstered its British venture by purchasing digital wealth manager Nutmeg for 700 million pounds ($973.00 million). The deal helps JPMorgan to tap a growing band of pandemic-era savers.
Goldman, whose Marcus savings account launched in Britain in 2018, plans to offer services like automated investment management in the UK next year after gathering more than $30 billion in deposits here.
Startups have also entered the British banking scene, including Metro and Monzo, but have made losses and have yet to crack the dominance of the big players. Germany's N26 exited the market after just two years.
""We are not underserved here; we have an awful lot of existing providers,"" said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at digital banking consultancy 11:FS. ""Who are they going to target?""
TEST CASE
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said last month the bank is using Britain as a test case to expand globally.
""The UK is the beginning,"" he said. ""If it works there, then we'll think about other things we could do with that.""
By offering products digitally, JPMorgan can see what strategies work best without the cost of branches, Dimon said.
JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank, with more than $1 trillion in consumer deposits as of March 31. Its retail business accounted for 42% of revenue last year, and it plans to have branches in 48 out of 50 U.S. states by the end of summer.
To grow, JPMorgan Chase's retail business needs to stretch beyond the United States. 
For Goldman, consumer banking is a key pillar of CEO David Solomon's reinvention plan. He wants to reduce reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. 
Goldman's fledgling consumer business accounted for less than 5% of its revenue last year. Deposits topped $100 billion in the first quarter.
Those figures are small relative to larger banks like JPMorgan, but Goldman is growing its consumer business quickly to get cheaper funding and new revenue sources.
""It mirrors what they are both doing in the U.S.,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) bank stock analyst Betsy Graseck. ""The rationale is they want to be servicing all consumers across savings, investing and borrowing.""
The two U.S. banks have chosen Britain because of its established payments system, solid regulatory infrastructure, an affluent customer base and compelling talent, analysts said.
""The UK is an extremely attractive market because of its thriving fintech ecosystem. Talent in the sector is both plentiful and ever-growing,"" said Ben Richmond, CEO of regtech Cube, which provides regulatory intelligence to banks.
Britain is also ahead in terms of Open Banking, which aims to give customers full control of their financial data, making it easier to switch banks.
""The UK is charging months ahead of the rest of Europe when it comes to Open Banking,"" said Aurelie L'Hostis, senior analyst at Forrester.
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs spokespeople declined to comment for this story. 
TOUGH MARKET
But the British market is also tough. The four largest UK banks reported a collective 12% decline in revenues last year as rock-bottom interest rates squeezed income. The industry has been pruning branches to cut costs, since customers are visiting less in favour of digital options.
Yet the digital challengers, including Monzo, Starling and Revolut, have had a mixed track record.
Some analysts, however, can see a path for JPMorgan and Goldman to take significant market share in Britain in everything from deposits to home loans.
""New entrants can only compete by keeping costs lower than competitors. JPMorgan and GS might have a competitive advantage in that they have deep pockets to build the technology from scratch or acquire new capabilities with fintech acquisitions,"" said L'Hostis. 
Britain's retail banks make the bulk of their profits on the difference between interest generated on loans - including from giant mortgage books - and what they pay out on deposits, because they do not charge for basic current accounts.
Goodbody's Cronin believes there could be space for a challenger in home lending, where the ten largest mortgage lenders in Britain accounted for 85% of the market in 2020, based on data published by banking trade body UK Finance.
""The returns in mortgages can be highly attractive, particularly if they can keep the cost base down,"" Cronin said.
Ultimately, the cost of rolling out these initiatives has to be worth it, said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) bank analyst Mike Mayo. For instance, JPMorgan scrapped its U.S. digital bank Finn just a year after a nationwide debut in 2017 because it did not work out as expected.

""They need to demonstrate a return on their tech investments,"" Mayo said.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 08:02AM ET</span>",Big banks brace as British forex class action seeks go-ahead,"By Kirstin Ridley and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - A specialist London court will decide whether a long-awaited multi-billion pound class action against some of the world's biggest banks over alleged foreign exchange rigging can proceed, after a five-day hearing kicked off on Monday. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), UBS and NatWest, along with Japan's MUFG Bank, are braced for the first forex class action in Britain over cartels dubbed ""Essex Express"" and ""Three Way Banana Split"".
The European Commission fined all the lenders https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-banks-idUSKCN1SM0XS apart from UBS, which had alerted the body to the two cartels, a total of more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the matter in 2019.
A similar decision https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-banks-fine-idUSKCN1T70J6 by the Swiss regulator added a further 90 million Swiss francs ($98.49 million) in fines. 
Michael O'Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog The Pensions Regulator, and Phillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at the Competition Markets Authority, are now vying to lead a class action case on behalf of pension funds and asset managers they claim lost out.
""This legal action will ensure that all affected entities - large and small, based in the UK and abroad – are able to obtain the compensation that they are owed,"" O'Higgins said in a statement ahead of the hearing.
London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) will decide whether to allow the planned lawsuit to proceed as a so-called collective action and, if so, which class representative is suitable to bring it.
Only Evans' case names MUFG. 
JPMorgan, Citi, Barclays, UBS, NatWest and MUFG all declined to comment.
Foreign exchange is the crown jewel of London's financial sector. 
With roughly 43% percent of the $8.3 trillion-per-day forex market traded in the city, lawyers have been sharpening swords since the European Commission found that banks shared commercially sensitive customer order information, transaction prices, open currency risk positions and other details between 2007 and 2013.
At the time the fines were levied in 2019, JPMorgan and RBS (LON:NWG), now NatWest, as well as UBS, said they had since made changes to their controls. MUFG said it had also taken measures to prevent a re-occurrence.
O'Higgins has instructed U.S. law firm Scott & Scott while Evans is being advised by Hausfeld - the two litigators that co-led a similar U.S. case against 15 banks and helped secure $2.3 billion in settlements for American claimants.
But a CAT judge said in 2019 there could only be one representative for a British lawsuit.
Investment banks across the globe have paid more than a combined $11 billion in fines to settle U.S. and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged forex markets.

According to Reuters, the country’s antitrust regulator is set to order Tencent Holdings' (OTC:TCEHY)’ music streaming arm to give up exclusive rights to music labels it has used to compete with smaller rivals.
The State Administration of Market Regulation will also fine it 500,000 yuan ($77,150) for lapses in reporting the acquisitions of apps Kuwo and Kugou, the report said.
In a separate matter Reuters reported Saturday, China's market regulator will block Tencent Holdings’ plan to merge the country's top two videogame streaming sites, Huya (NYSE:HUYA) and DouYu (NASDAQ:DOYU) on antitrust grounds.
Tencent is Huya's biggest shareholder with almost 37% stake and also owns over a third of DouYu.
SAMR said Huya and DouYu’s combined market share in the video game live streaming industry would be over 70% and their merger would be anti-competitive, given Tencent already has over 40% market share in the online games operations segment.

Countries across Europe are looking at ways to produce emissions-free hydrogen to help reduce carbon emissions and avert global warming. 
Clean hydrogen can be produced from water using electricity generated by renewable energy sources.
When produced from natural gas, it is considered clean when the associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are captured and stored permanently. Today, most of the associated CO2 emissions are released into the atmosphere. 
Partners ACH, Shell and Norwegian infrastructure investor CapeOmega have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to build a large-scale hydrogen production facility at Aukra in western Norway, ACH said.
The clean hydrogen could be used to decarbonise local industries, for emissions-free fuel for vehicles and ships, or for export to Europe, ACH said.
Natural gas for the project would be supplied from the Nyhamna gas processing plant nearby, it added.

Shell serves as a technical service provider at the Nyhamna plant, which processes natural gas its Ormen Lange field and Equinor's Aasta Hansteen field off Norway.
The Anglo-Dutch energy firm, which aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, is also a partner in a joint venture project with Equinor and TotalEnergies to build CO2 storage off Norway.

The acquisition is in line with Novo's strategy to diversify its core insulin portfolio that has been facing tough competition, prompting it to turn toward newer diabetes and obesity drugs to revive growth. 
Under the agreement, Prothena will receive $100 million in upfront and near-term clinical milestone payments for PRX004, currently in a mid-stage trial. 
Prothena in December had reported positive data from an early-stage trial of PRX004 to treat hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a life-threatening genetic disease that affects the heart, nerves and other organs. 
Novo Nordisk said it would focus on developing PRX004 for ATTR cardiomyopathy, a potentially fatal form of the disease characterized by a build-up of amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue. 

The Danish firm in June last year had agreed to buy AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) spin-off Corvidia Therapeutics for an initial $725 million to expand into cardiovascular disease treatments.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Monday ahead of the start of the new quarterly reporting season, with key inflation data and testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell also due.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 145 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 30 points, or 0.2%.
The three major indices closed at record highs on Friday, rebounding after Thursday’s sharp selloff. However, Wall Street is expected to give back some of these gains Monday, with the exception of the high growth tech stocks, on concerns about the spread of the highly-transmissible delta strain of the Covid-19 virus. The U.S. recorded its highest daily total of new cases since May over the weekend.
Also of interest will be the start of the quarterly earnings season, with the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) set to start the ball rolling on Tuesday.
The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for the second quarter is just over 65% from the same period a year ago, according to data from Refinitiv, which would be the strongest earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009. The year-on-year numbers will be boosted in the main by extremely weak comparable results from a year ago.
Additionally, the U.S. is scheduled to release key inflation data for June later this week, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify in front of Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, potentially providing clues on the central bank’s thinking over tapering.
In the corporate sector, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock rose 7.3% in premarket after the company successfully completed its first full-crew spaceflight over the weekend, an important step towards the launch of a commercial space tourism service next year.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) will also be in focus after its Black Widow movie grossed $218 million on its debut weekend, with some $60 million of that generated by distribution through the Disney+ streaming channel. 
Elsewhere, oil prices also weakened Monday given the rising Covid-19 cases and the uncertainty following the lack of agreement at the last meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies over production levels.
However, prices remain at elevated levels with U.S. officials reporting hefty drops in the nation’s crude inventories and soaring gasoline demand.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google will seek to overturn a record 4.34-billion-euro ($5.15 billion) EU antitrust fine at a five-day hearing in September at Europe's second-highest court, people familiar with the matter said.
The European Commission in its 2018 decision said Google had used its popular Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals, an anti-competitive practice dating from 2011.
Android, used by device makers for free, is found on about 80% of the world's smartphones. The case is the most important of the EU's three cases against Google because of Android's market power. Google has racked up more than 8 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in the last decade.
The hearing will kick off on Sept. 27, the people said. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Luxembourg-based General Court said it could not confirm the hearing as the dates have not been made public for now. The five-day event is longer than average but not unusual.
Google is backed by lobbying groups Application Developers Alliance (ADA) and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), Android device makers Gigaset Communications GmbH and HMD Global Oy, which is the exclusive licensee of the Nokia (NYSE:NOK) brand for phones, and Norwegian tech company Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) Software.
The Commission has the support of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), German publishing groups VDZ and BDZV, Czech search engine Seznam, lobbying group FairSearch and French search engine Qwant.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators may revamp decades-old rules covering the market power of companies to take into account cases such as when tech giants offer products for free while harvesting users' data, or the impact of deals on innovation, 
The comments from the European Commission on Monday followed feedback from national competition watchdogs, experts and other parties during a 16-month consultation of the Commission's rule known as the market definition notice.
The rule, which dates back to 1997, helps regulators measure a company's pricing power in a merger or its power to shut out rivals in an antitrust case. The regulators use that information to decide whether to demand concessions from the company. 
Lawyers and academics have in recent years criticised EU antitrust laws for failing to keep up with the times, especially regarding U.S. tech giants' merger deals and market power.
The feedback showed that the current rule may be inadequate when it comes to small, but lasting increases in prices, and in digital markets where products or services are offered for free, the EU competition enforcer said.
It is also not up to date when assessing geographic markets in an era of globalisation and import competition, the use of quantitative techniques, the calculation of market shares and non-price competition such as innovation.

""The evaluation indicates that the notice does not fully cover recent evolutions in market definition practice, including those related to the digitalisation of the economy,"" Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
""We will now analyse if and how the notice should be revised to address the issues we have identified,"" she said.

The company confirmed the tender after Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith was quoted as saying Air France-KLM had approached Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) about 160 jets.
""We've done a little bit in this area, it's been on the agenda since 2004, but it's never been put in place as it is now. I am very pleased to be able to put together this order, the largest in the group's history,"" he told the daily Het Financieele Dagblad in an interview.
A competition for medium-haul jets would typically pit the Airbus A321neo family against the Boeing 737 MAX, although Air France has also ordered the smaller Canadian-designed A220 jet for its French operation.
Smith said in the interview that the Air France-KLM combination had slipped behind competitors Lufthansa of Germany and Anglo-Spanish IAG (LON:ICAG), which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus.

Air France-KLM should strengthen cooperation to be able to respond more quickly to market developments, he said, without specifying which business segments.
""In 2004, Air France-KLM was the largest group in Europe, now we are number three. They have worked more effectively. Obviously we can do that too, but we need to move forward a little faster.""

Investing.com – Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) ADRs were down by more than 4% in Monday’s premarket as the company warned its revenue would suffer as a result of the Cyberspace Administration of China's order withdrawing 25 more of its apps from local app stores.
“The company expects that the app takedown may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,” a company note said today.
The CAC ordered the apps' withdrawal on Friday, alleging the apps illegally collect personal data.
The spate of listings by Chinese companies in the U.S. has raised the heckles of the authorities there, owing to the fact that big Internet-based companies possess vast amount of data on their users. Being listed in the U.S., they are required to disclose crucial data to the U.S. regulators.   
The apps targeted in Friday’s crackdown include Didi’s app for drivers offering rides through its platform, an app for corporate users and a financing app. On July 4, the CAC had ordered mobile stores like Alipay and WeChat to remove Didi’s main app in China.
The country’s authorities took other steps too over the weekend that indicate a tougher life for the ride-hailing company in the coming days.
On Saturday, a cybersecurity review was proposed for companies with data on more than 1 million users before they seek to list in foreign countries, according to various reports.
China’s State Council plans a closer scrutiny of all offshore listings. The fallout of these moves has been immediate. Chinese companies have lost billions of dollars in market cap, leaving many American investors poorer. It has also forced other Chinese aspirants to look for other listing avenues.
According to another WSJ report, TikTok’s parent Bytedance has put on hold its plans for a public listing in the U.S. due to the tightened oversight.

The case has added to growing worries over backsliding on democratic principles in Poland, as well as leading to a standoff between Washington and its staunch European ally.
The TV regulator told Reuters the broadcaster, TVN24, was in violation of Poland's cap on foreign ownership of media, and that the body was split on whether to renew the licence after the current one expires on Sept. 26. 
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party submitted draft legal amendments that might challenge Discovery to divest most of its Polish business - estimated to be worth more than $1 billion - to continue broadcasting in the country of 38 million people. 
""The new draft Polish law on broadcasting concessions is yet another worrying signal for media freedom and pluralism in the country,"" European Union Commissioner for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova said on Twitter. 
""We follow closely the situation related to TVN24 whose licence has not been renewed yet.""
The increasingly authoritarian PiS has long argued that foreign-owned media outlets distort public debate and do not serve Polish interests. 
Poland recently used its state-run refiner, PKN Orlen, to buy out a newspaper publisher from Germanowners, giving Warsaw more influence over 20 local dailies, thewebsites of which get nearly 17 million visitors a day.
PiS lawmaker Marek Suski was quoted last Saturday as saying the Polish government was moving to increase its influence over TVN, which is the parent company of TVN24 and has more than a dozen channels in Poland, as well as a video on demand platform.

Decarbonisation of the shipping value chain is already well underway and will continue to be front and centre for ship owners, charterers and financiers in the decade ahead. 
The ZCFI comes as the European Union is due to unveil climate legislation this week which is likely to include the extension of the EU emissions trading system (ETS) to the maritime sector.
As a consequence, the shipping industry would have to factor in carbon costs when conducting voyages that call at EU ports.
""By referencing the ZCFI, market participants will have a new reference point, which they can use to calculate the cost of their carbon exposure, thereby giving a clearer, more indicative picture of their overall transportation cost,"" EEX, which is part of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), said in a statement.
Participants would be able to make more informed trading decisions on this basis, which would help them navigate more easily through the decarbonisation process, it said.

The index uses the EEX Dry Freight forward freight agreement (FFA) market's daily timecharter prices for capesize and panamax vessels and adjusts them for the cost of carbon by drawing on EEX EU carbon allowances futures (EUAs).
The EEX Zero Carbon Freight Index is available via www.eex.com, www.eexasia.com, the Cleartech Portal, and the EEX Group Daily Freight Market Update Report.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>","Politics, health collided in Taiwan's tortured BioNTech vaccine talks","By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - As talks for Taiwan to access BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s COVID-19 vaccine via two major Taiwanese companies reached a head last week, the German firm's Chinese sales agent put forward a template contract seeking access to Taiwanese medical records.
The clause sparked alarm, as such a requirement would be anathema for Taiwan's government, long wary of Beijing's attempts at influence over the democratic island, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
""The other side did propose such a contract template, which made negotiators in Taiwan and the Taiwan government feel puzzled and troubled, but after talks, the other side stopped insisting and adjusted it in a short time,"" the source said.
Reuters could not determine why Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd sent the template, and the company did not respond to requests for comment.
But the incident highlights how politics became entangled with a public health issue, laying bare wider disagreements between the governments of China and Taiwan.
The BioNTech issue has challenged China's efforts to project a benign global image through vaccine diplomacy, especially after Taiwan's direct deal with BioNTech collapsed in January.
Shortly after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen accused China in late May of blocking her government's deal with BioNTech, Japan and the United States announced they would donate millions of vaccines to the island.
Germany also said it had been helping in Taiwan's talks with BioNTech.
CONTENTIOUS CONTRACT
Fosun's contract template, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, stipulated that it or its ""authorised representatives"" should have the right to audit the vaccination process, including checking facilities and reviewing documentation. 
It also granted Fosun the right to collect data and interview vaccine recipients, something more akin to a clinical trial than a mass vaccination scheme.
Two other sources briefed on the talks said that personal information was never going to be sent to China, and that the contract was only a template based on a deal signed with Chinese-run Hong Kong. ""It was just that - a template"" and a starting point for negotiations, one of the sources said. On Sunday, Fosun said an agreement had been signed to provide the vaccines to two Taiwanese tech firms, Foxconn and TSMC. Taiwan's government allowed them last month to negotiate on its behalf, after public pressure about the slow pace of vaccines arriving.
TSMC said the template was not the contract they signed, and declined to comment further.
A representative for Foxconn's billionaire founder Terry Gou, who led a high-profile campaign to buy the vaccines and donate them to Taiwan's government, rejected the idea that the template was a problem, or that detailed data would have been sent to China.
Other data, such as reporting on patients who have serious reactions to vaccine shots, will be closely protected, she said.
""The follow-up information exchange shall comply with Taiwan regulations, protect privacy, and be used for medical purposes,"" Amanda Liu told Reuters.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office referred Reuters to a faxed statement on June 23 in which it denied seeking to block Taiwan from getting vaccines from overseas.
It said Taiwan's government ""on the one hand refuses mainland vaccines and on the other blames it for the lack of vaccines on the island"".
BioNTech did not respond to questions about the template contract. Taiwan's Presidential Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China's government had said repeatedly that if Taiwan wanted the BioNTech vaccine it had to do it through Fosun. 
Chinese state media has also relentlessly focused on how bad the pandemic was in Taiwan, though even the latest outbreak was relatively small and is now well under control.
The drama has fascinated Taiwan's public and led news coverage for weeks, even as other vaccines directly purchased by the government from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) arrive.
One Taiwan-based official familiar with the vaccine talks said Taiwan arguably did not need vaccine deliveries as urgently as countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, where the virus is spreading fast.

Moreover, he said, Taiwan's accusations that China earlier obstructed the BioNTech shots worked in Taipei's favour because it prompted Washington and Tokyo into action.
""This was always a political not a health issue,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse announced the departure of its Swiss chief compliance officer on Monday as recently appointed Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio shakes up the bank in the wake of a series of costly blunders.
The bank was forced to wind down $10 billion in funds linked to collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill and suffered billions in losses after family office Archegos imploded.
On Monday it said Floriana Scarlato, compliance boss at Swiss Universal Bank (SUB) just since March 1, would leave with immediate effect to pursue opportunities elsewhere.
Scarlato, who joined in 2005, was previously chief compliance officer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s International Wealth Management division, where sources say a post-Greensill overhaul is now under consideration.
Horta-Osorio, who took over two months ago, has vowed to scrutinise risk management and culture following Credit Suisse's serial mishaps, as well as to review the bank's strategic options for the bank.
Separately, the bank named Markus Ruetimann as new global chief operating officer of Credit Suisse Asset Management, turning to the ex-UBS manager to help it recover from repeated crises.
He will join Ulrich Korner, another former UBS executive named in March to lead asset management.
The bank said Scarlato is also stepping down from her posts as SUB management committee member and from the executive board of Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd.

""Floriana Scarlato's successor will be announced in due course,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement.
Her exit follows that of the bank's chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, in April.

VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC, became the country's first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer when its gasoline-powered models built under its own badge hit the streets in 2019.
""VinFast has set up representative offices in five international markets and will soon open showrooms in California,"" Vingroup said. 
""VinFast USA's CEO has already relocated to the U.S. from Vietnam recently,"" the company added.
The company had set a target of selling 56,000 electric vehicles in 2022, but had scaled that back to 15,000 units due to global chip shortage, Vingroup's chairman Pham Nhat Vuong told the company's annual meeting in June.
VinFast, which achieved annual sales of around 30,000 units last year in Vietnam, has yet to make a profit. 
In an interview with Reuters in April, the CEO of VinFast USA said they were betting on a battery leasing scheme and planning on conducting most of its U.S. sales online, removing the need for a costly dealership network.
The company said two electric car models, the VF (NYSE:VFC) e35 and VF e36, would be officially launched in March next year.

To support its growth, VinFast will need more cash. It flagged in April that it would consider an initial public offering in the United States or merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company.
However, sources told Reuters in May VinFast's offering, which was slated for the second quarter and could help the company raise at least $2 billion, faced a delay.

Although 2021 has been a record year for IPOs in Europe and globally, there are signs of investor fatigue.
""We had very good initial contacts with investors that we met in recent weeks and we are confident we can pursue this project,"" Colis Privé said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Investing.com - European stock markets headed lower Monday, with investors starting an event-packed week on a cautious note as they seek out fresh cues.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.7%.
The major indices in Europe ended last week with sharp gains, but there are plenty of reasons for investors to take a watchful stance this week.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Sunday that the central bank will update its guidance on monetary stimulus at its next meeting, and indicated that fresh policy might be introduced in 2022 to support the European economy to replace the current ""Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program"". That's pushing back against warnings from the German-led bloc of ECB members who want the extraordinary level of stimulus to be wound down as soon as possible. The ECB has already more than doubled the size of that program to 1.85 trillion euro ($2.2 trillion) since first announcing it last year.
Last week the ECB changed its stance on inflation, potentially allowing CPI to climb higher than its 2% goal if the circumstance dictates. 
Away from Europe, the U.S. is scheduled to release key inflation data for June later this week, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify in front of Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. China, where regulators launched another salvo at local technology companies over the weekend, is set to release second-quarter GDP data on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in large parts of Asia, while the U.S. had the most cases since mid-May as the delta variant spreads in less vaccinated parts of the nation.
Turning to the corporate sector, German chemicals giant BASF, a bellwether for European cyclical stocks, fell 0.3% despite raising its full-year forecasts for the second time in quick succession. 
French IT consulting group Atos (PA:ATOS) slumped over 13% after cutting its full-year earnings forecast, and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) stock fell 0.3% after the online trading platform reported a sharp fall in customer income for the first half of the year.
 Daily Mail  and General Trust (LON:DMGOa) stock rose 5% after its largest shareholder, the Rothermere family, said it was considering taking the British newspaper private in a 810-million-pound ($1.13 billion) deal.
Additionally, ASOS (LON:ASOS) stock rose 0.6% after U.S. giant Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) announced that it had acquired a minority stake in four brands owned by the British online fashion house, including Topshop and Miss Selfridge, in a bid for younger shoppers. 
This week also sees the start of the quarterly earnings season on Wall Street, with the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) due to report on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Monday amid uncertainty within the sector given the rising Covid-19 cases globally and the lack of agreement at the last meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies over production levels.
However, prices remain at elevated levels with U.S. officials reporting hefty drops in the nation’s crude inventories and soaring gasoline demand.
At 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $73.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $74.88.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,804.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1877.

Earlier this year it announced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kinnevik-dividend-zalando-idUSKBN2AH0VN plans to distribute its stake in German online fashion group Zalando to its shareholders.
The company, which counts influential Swedish Stenbeck family and Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford among its shareholders, said it had invested 734 million crowns in four companies in the quarter. [nGNE7N5TYY] 
""We are not obliged to deploy capital from one quarter to another or from one year to another, but it's actually when the opportunities arise,"" Chief Executive Officer Georgi Ganev told Reuters.
""Two years ago we deployed around 4.6 billion crowns and deployed two and a half last year, and this year will be somewhere in the middle of that range.""
On Monday, Kinnevik said it had invested 49 million euros in a 210-million-euro funding round in Nordic ""neo-bank"" Lunar.
Kinnevik's shares have more than doubled in the last one year as its focus on digital businesses led to many of its holdings rising rapidly in the midst of the pandemic.
While the Swedish firm's investments range from telecom operator Tele2 to delivery startup Budbee, it has deepened its focus on the healthcare industry with investments in companies such as Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) and Babylon.
""We have generated more than 25 billion crowns out of the healthcare portfolio, and we are continuing that journey with new investments within the healthcare sector,"" Ganev said.

1059,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 02:36AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s $6 Billion Bonanza Chilled by China IPO Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Just months after bankers celebrated a record haul from taking Chinese companies public in New York and Hong Kong, they’ve had a rude awakening. Deals are being shelved and investors are nursing heavy losses.
A chill has settled over global finance after a fortnight in which China first cracked down on its Uber-like Didi Global Inc (NYSE:DIDI) within days of a U.S. trading debut, followed swiftly by the State Council announcing closer scrutiny of all offshore listings. On Saturday, a cybersecurity review was proposed for companies with data on more than 1 million users before they seek to list in foreign countries.
The warning signs had been flashing for a while. As underwriters totted up a record $1.5 billion in fees last year from helping Chinese firms with initial public offerings offshore, relations between China and the U.S. were at a low ebb. In December, Donald Trump signed a bill that could delist Chinese companies that don’t meet audit inspection rules. Simultaneously, President Xi Jinping stepped up oversight of big technology firms, partly to secure the treasure trove of data they control.
The moves imperil the frenetic dealmaking seen during the pandemic, and the lucrative business of offshore listings that’s pulled in some $6.4 billion in fees since 2014, when  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s began trading in New York.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and China International Capital Corp. topped the league tables over that stretch, when nearly 40% of fees came from U.S. deals.
Bankers now say they expect the majority of Chinese IPOs aimed for American exchanges to be suspended or diverted to other venues, eating into projected revenue for the year given the significantly lower fees in Hong Kong. Listing requirements in the financial hub and mainland China are also more stringent, making deals there far from certain.
“There are some uncertainties that might take one or two months to work its course,” David Chin, head of investment banking in Asia Pacific at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) said of China’s changing rules at a briefing last week. “Ultimately, China will find a solution because the U.S. has been very supportive of Chinese internet companies, the development of them, and the subsequent financing.”In the meantime, what had been a healthy IPO pipeline is weakening. One immediate victim was LinkDoc Technology Ltd., a Beijing-based medical data company, which halted preparations for a U.S. IPO on Thursday.
Fitness app Keep has also opted not to go ahead with a planned U.S. public filing, the Financial Times reported. Podcast app Ximalaya’s U.S. IPO is also in limbo, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Other deals that could be in doubt include Hong Kong delivery firm Lalamove’s potential $1 billion IPO.
In all, China’s crackdown on overseas listing threatens about 70 other private firms based in Hong Kong and China that are set to go public in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Valuations for China’s technology firms, which were already falling before the recent onslaught, now look shakier as investors signal they will demand steeper discounts to buy shares, said one banker, asking not the named discussing internal business. So far this month, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index -- which tracks some of the biggest Chinese firms listed in the U.S. -- has shed some $145 billion in value.
At the heart of the recent crackdown is how far regulators will go to check foreign investment in sensitive industries, particularly those controlling vast amounts of data. For two decades China’s technology giants have sidestepped restrictions, using the so-called Variable Interest Entity model to attract foreign capital and IPO offshore.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission is now leading efforts to revise overseas listings rules that would require VIE firms, which do business in China but are registered in places like the Cayman Islands, to seek approval before selling shares overseas, Bloomberg has reported. The Cyberspace Administration of China said Saturday that its proposed review would address risks for data to be “affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign governments.”
Undercut Fees
Hong Kong looks well placed to benefit from the geopolitical and regulatory frictions though dealmaking in the financial hub may also become entangled in the regulatory push. If IPOs of Chinese unicorns grind to a halt, the Hong Kong exchange should still be boosted by secondary listings and the conversion of American depository receipts, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sharnie Wong.
“Some Chinese companies that operate in sensitive sectors might be thinking of listing in Hong Kong instead of the U.S.,” said Kenneth Ho, managing director of equity capital markets at Haitong International. “Currently the H.K. IPO pipeline is ridiculously vibrant.”
The rerouting will undercut fees banks can earn after a decade in which Chinese firms raised about $76 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S.
Banks typically charge about 1.5% to 2% for billion-dollar offerings in Hong Kong, compared with 3% to 5% in the U.S. as fees vary with sectors and underwriters. That increases by about two percentage points or more for deals below $500 million, bankers familiar with the matter said.
In mainland China, fees for listing on Shanghai’s tech-heavy STAR board are about equal to the U.S. but sponsors are required to co-invest in between 2% and 5% of the shares issued by their clients, an unusual arrangement that may limit interest in leading deals due to the need for a capital base onshore.
The tighter regulatory regime comes against a backdrop of China opening its financial market to allow foreign banks and asset managers to set up wholly owned firms. Powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs have been ramping up their staffing, seeking to double or triple their headcounts in mainland China, as they expand to capture billions in potential profits in the world’s second-largest economy.
China’s Nasdaq-like STAR market has made it easier for technology firms to access funding at home, though it places an emphasis on companies focused on hardcore technology and innovation.
China’s dependence of foreign capital to fuel its businesses has decreased from where it was less than a decade ago, said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “We’re in a world where it’s not really that hard for Chinese firms to raise a large quantity of capital without listing their shares aboard.”
Even so, UBS’ Chin said it’s doubtful that many Chinese companies can meet domestic listing requirements, which have become more stringent this year.
“Ultimately they’ll have to list somewhere else,” he said. “We are very used to this type of regulatory development and uncertainties, and ultimately the commercial logic will prevail and the financing and IPOs will continue.”

1060,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 02:04AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Caution Prevails as Week Starts,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening just lower Monday, with investors starting an event-packed week on a cautious note as they seek out fresh cues.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%. 
The major indices in Europe ended last week with sharp gains, with the DAX in Germany climbing 1.7%, the CAC 40 in France gaining over 2% and the FTSE 100 up 1.3%, as strong advances on Wall Street and policy easing in China helped calm some of the recent anxiety over global growth.
That said, there are plenty of reasons for investors to take a watchful stance this week.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Sunday that the central bank will update its guidance on monetary stimulus at its next meeting, and indicated that fresh policy might be introduced in 2022 to support the European economy to replace the current bond-buying program.
Last week the ECB changed its stance on inflation, potentially allowing CPI to climb higher than its 2% goal if the circumstance dictates.
Away from Europe, the U.S. is scheduled to release key inflation data for June later this week, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify in front of Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, potentially providing clues on the central bank’s thinking over tapering.
Additionally, China will release second-quarter GDP data on Thursday amid concerns they could disappoint given a sudden easing in monetary policy last week.
The number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in large parts of Asia, while the U.S. had the most cases since mid-May as the delta variant spreads in less vaccinated parts of the nation.
This week also sees the start of the quarterly earnings season on Wall Street, with the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) due to report on Tuesday.
Back in Europe, ASOS (LON:ASOS) is likely to be in the spotlight Monday after U.S. giant Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) announced that it has acquired a minority stake in four brands owned by the British online fashion house, including Topshop and Miss Selfridge, in a bid for younger shoppers.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Monday amid uncertainty within the sector given the rising Covid-19 cases globally and the lack of agreement at the last meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies over production levels.
However, prices remain at elevated levels with U.S. officials reporting hefty drops in the nation’s crude inventories and soaring gasoline demand.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $74.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $75.37.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,800.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1868.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Singapore's Temasek set to post record portfolio in global equities rally,"By Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings' portfolio value likely rebounded to scale a record in the year ending March, boosted by a rally in global markets and the public listing of some of its holdings.
Analysts expect the value of Temasek's assets to have jumped over 20% in the year ending March, pushing up the portfolio value to roughly S$375 billion ($277.7 billion) - after dipping 2.2% to S$306 billion a year ago - which marked the first drop after three consecutive years of gains.
The long-term outlook for Temasek, one of the world's biggest state investors, has been clouded by its support to pandemic-hit businesses. Temasek bulked up funding to Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and offshore marine services firm Sembcorp Marine, among others.
""We have seen broad economic growth and a rebound in financial markets, but there are industries which are facing headwinds, so the challenge for big long-term investors like Temasek and GIC really is about managing portfolios in which occasionally, some sectors will take a hit,"" said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking.
Temasek is anchored in Asia, with a 66% exposure to the region as measured by underlying assets, most of which are in China and Singapore. But the investor has been stepping up investments in the United States, especially in the tech sector.
Temasek said it will give details of its annual performance this week, while larger investor GIC will publish its annual report later this month.
Analysts expect no major change to Temasek's strategy, though senior executive Dilhan Pillay is set to take over as the CEO of the investment firm from Ho Ching, who is retiring after heading Temasek for 17 years.
Unlike many state investors, the majority of Temasek's investments are in equities, with unlisted assets making up a record 48% of its portfolio in the year to March 2020.
Global equities have surged over the past financial year, with MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index rallying 55% and Singapore's Straits Times index rising 28%.
""There remains a flood of liquidity, so competition for funding is still fierce,"" said Song.
Among the shares held by Temasek that posted strong gains over the past financial year, DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) surged 55%, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) rose 12% and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) gained 16%. 
Some other firms in Temasek's portfolio, notably Airbnb and food delivery firm Doordash, had public listings.

""I don't expect Temasek's medium to long term strategy to change due to any result this year - it is obviously ruled by a long term horizon and aims at anticipating the market by being one of the world's largest and most active investors in VC (venture capital) and technology,"" said Diego Lopez, managing director of sovereign wealth fund tracker Global SWF.

1062,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2021 12:18AM ET</span>",Yellen to Press Europe on Digital Tax Plan Following G-20 Accord,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will press European Union officials in Brussels this week to reconsider their plan to propose a digital levy after securing the Group of Twenty’s endorsement for the principles of a global corporate-tax agreement.
Yellen is in Brussels Monday and Tuesday following the gathering of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in Venice, which concluded Saturday with the group’s call to finish work on the global plan’s details by October.
The Treasury chief is set to make the case for the EU to hold off on unveiling its plan for a bloc-wide digital levy on online sales. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has delayed the rollout until July 20 amid pressure to withdraw it or show that it’s compatible with the global effort on how and where to tax the profits of multinational companies.
Some European officials are considering a further postponement of any digital-levy proposal until the fall, according to people familiar with the plans.
Asked Sunday if the planned levy would violate the global deal, Yellen avoided a direct answer but signaled the U.S. is not satisfied with the EU’s justification for it.
“It’s really up to the European Commission and the members of the European Union to decide how to proceed,” she said. “But those countries have agreed to avoid putting in place in the future, and to dismantle, taxes that are discriminatory against U.S. firms.”
Digital Services
The global deal is designed to stop major corporations from moving to low-tax jurisdictions and to establish a fairer system for distributing the taxation rights on multinationals, based on where they operate instead of where they are headquartered.
The latter component also includes an agreement to end so-called digital services taxes that several European countries have implemented to target the revenues of large tech companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google.
While EU officials haven’t finalized the plan for the bloc-wide levy, they have said its name is misleading and it wouldn’t qualify as a DST.
“I really think we can fix the issue, we can alleviate the difficulties,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Saturday. “There are solutions and I’m sure that the European Commission will do its best efforts to find solutions with the American administration.”
The Treasury Secretary is set to meet with the European Union finance ministers collectively Monday, and will also have separate meetings with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis, among others.
After agreeing to jointly issue 750 billion euros of debt to pay for the recovery from the Covid pandemic, the EU is preoccupied with finding new resources to finance the plan. The idea of a digital levy is just one of the options, which could also include a plastic packaging tax.
Hurdles Ahead
Yellen will sit down with the bloc’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, whom she has already lobbied on the tax issue. When asked last week about U.S. pressure to drop the digital levy, Vestager expressed resistance.
“The discussions that we have in Europe about own resources to fund the recovery and resilience plan eventually - these are for us and we will have those discussions internally in the commission as to how to deal with it,” she said.
So far, 132 countries and jurisdictions have backed the two-part global plan. Over the weekend Yellen, along with her counterparts from Germany and France, each expressed confidence that the proposed global tax deal can overcome political obstacles in Washington and within the European Union in time for it to be finalized in October.
Yellen said she’s “very optimistic” that the U.S. Congress would pass legislation this autumn needed to implement the part of the deal calling for a minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15% across countries. She also said she hoped that Congress could address the portion of the deal dealing with the redistribution of tax rights as soon as spring of 2022.
European leaders face their own internal fights to get the agreement adopted across the 27-member bloc. Ireland, Hungary and Estonia have so far refused to sign up to the minimum tax, creating a potential roadblock because of the need for unanimity on tax issues within the EU.
The EU commission is working on a directive to implement the global tax deal and German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has expressed optimism the three countries will eventually back the deal. They are opposed to an effective minimum tax of 15%.
Yellen will meet with Paschal Donohoe, finance minister of Ireland, while in Brussels.
Donohoe, who is also president of the Eurogroup of euro-zone finance ministers, said earlier this month that the nation isn’t yet ready to agree to a global minimum tax rate of at least 15%, though he intends to hold a public consultation in the country on the draft agreement. The government also pledged to “constructively engage” in the tax discussions. Ireland is among nations that have used low business taxes as a key economic development strategy.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>","Pfizer, U.S. health officials to discuss COVID boosters on Monday -company","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccine maker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) will meet with federal health officials as soon as Monday to discuss the need for a booster dose of the coronavirus vaccine as it prepares to seek authorization, the company said on Sunday. 
The meeting comes days after the drugmaker and its partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) announced plans to seek U.S. and European regulatory approval for a third dose of their COVID-19 shot amid the spread of variants and data they said showed heightened risk of infection six months after initial inoculation. 
That push prompted a quick response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying Americans do not need a booster right now.
On Monday, Pfizer is scheduled to meet with representatives of the FDA, a company spokesperson said. The meeting was first reported by the Washington Post.
Representatives for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser who also directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as the heads of the National Institutes of Health and the CDC were also among those invited to the briefing, which could move to another day, according to the Post's report. 
Fauci, in several television interviews on Sunday, said U.S. health officials were not dismissing the possible future need for boosters -- especially as breakthrough infections among those who have been vaccinated have emerged -- but that more data is needed for any formal recommendation. 
""There's a lot of dynamic things going on right now,"" he told ABC News' ""This Week"" program. 
""There are studies being done now ongoing as we speak about looking at the feasibility about if and when we should be boosting people... there's a lot of work going on to examine this in real time,"" he added on CNN's ""State of the Union."" 
Despite the FDA and CDC's statement, ""that doesn't mean that we're not very, very actively following and gathering all of this information to see if and when we might need it and if and when we do, we'll have everything in place to do it."" 
U.S. health officials are still struggling to get people in some areas to receive their initial inoculations as the highly contagious Delta variant has grown to be the nation's dominant strain, with COVID-19 cases rising mostly among the unvaccinated.
European officials has also said vaccines currently seem protective against variants. Canada has also said it is monitoring variants and the possible need for boosters.

While some scientists have also questioned the need for booster shots, others have said they could be beneficial for the elderly and other vulnerable populations, although it is unclear when they would be needed.
Some public health experts have also expressed concern that authorizing boosters in wealthy developed nations while other countries are still struggling against initial inoculations will further exacerbate vaccine inequity.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2021 04:50PM ET</span>",BlackRock CEO calls for stronger climate finance plan at G20 meet,"By Simon Jessop and Gavin Jones
VENICE (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Sunday called for governments to develop a stronger long-term climate finance plan to unlock the private capital needed to fund the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Speaking to The Venice International Conference on Climate at a meeting of G20 Finance Ministers, he said without such a plan, current efforts, including on corporate sustainability disclosures, risked being ""nothing more than window dressing"".
Fink, who heads the world's biggest asset manager, with around $9 trillion in assets, also called for reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to make them more suited to tackle the challenge of climate change. 
Fink, highlighted three ""critical"" issues needed to power the ecological transition, which he said represented a $50 trillion opportunity for investors. BlackRock itself is a major investor in fossil fuels.
Firstly, he said private companies needed to be under the same pressure to share information on their sustainability efforts as public companies.
Currently, listed oil and gas companies had a ""massive incentive"" to sell out of more polluting assets, often to private and state-owned companies on which there is less scrutiny and which disclose far less about their operations.
Secondly, Fink said governments risked fuelling inequality unless they created more demand for greener products and services, lowering the cost, or 'green premium', that penalises the worse off and could fuel social instability.
Lastly, global institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF needed to be changed so they could do more to encourage private sector capital to help fund the transition in emerging markets.
He noted that the two bodies were created nearly 80 years ago based on a bank balance sheet model and said it was now necessary to ""rethink their roles."" 

Citing BlackRock's role in the creation of a $250 million public-private climate finance strategy to help fund sustainable infrastructure, in which government and philanthropic investors provide subordinated capital to protect the returns of private investors, he said more of the same was needed.
""If we don't have international institutions providing that kind of first-loss position at a greater scale than they do today, properly overseeing these investments, and bringing down the cost of financing and the cost of equity, we're just not going to be able to attract the private capital necessary for the energy transition in the emerging markets,"" he said.

The companies, which include Europe's top three insurers by premiums - Allianz (DE:ALVG), AXA and Generali (MI:GASI) - said the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) would work to shift underwriting portfolios towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The move comes as insurers come under increasing pressure to spell out how they plan to decarbonise their businesses amid growing calls for them to stop underwriting and investing in fossil fuel projects.
Each of the companies will individually set intermediate targets every five years and report on progress annually in cooperation with competition authorities, the NZIA members said in a statement.
""With this new Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, we are raising our climate ambition further,"" said Thomas Buberl, Chief Executive of the AXA Group, which chairs the NZIA.
NZIA members, which also include  Aviva  (LON:AV), Munich Re, SCOR, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) and Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF), will set underwriting criteria for the most carbon-intensive activities in their underwriting portfolios and offer solutions for low-emission and zero-emission technologies.
They will also include net-zero and decarbonisation risk criteria in their risk management frameworks. 
""By committing to join the gold standard alliance for net zero, the (NZIA) will ultimately make underwriting contingent on underlying companies having credible net-zero transition strategies,"" said U.N. climate envoy Mark Carney.

The Alliance, first outlined in April, was presented by Generali CEO Philippe Donnet at Sunday's G20 Climate Summit in Venice.
Many of the leading Europe-based insurers have already adopted climate-friendly policies. Last month, Generali pledged to reach carbon neutrality in its direct investment portfolio by 2050.

LONDON (Reuters) -Banks clearing gold trades in London can apply for an exemption from tighter capital rules due in January 2022, a British regulator said on Friday, removing what some said was a threat to the functioning of the market.
London is the world's biggest physical precious metals trading hub. Its clearing system, operated by a handful of large banks with access to metal in vaults - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), HSBC, ICBC Standard and UBS - settles gold transactions worth around $30 billion a day.
The upcoming rules, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), are part of Basel III regulations designed to make banks more stable and prevent a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008-09. 
The rules treat physically traded gold like any other commodity, requiring banks to hold more cash to match their gold exposure as a buffer against adverse price moves.
The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), an industry body, has lobbied against them, saying they are unnecessary and could force some banks – including clearing banks - to stop trading. 
Following a consultation, the Bank of England's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulatory Authority (PRA) said on Friday it had ""decided to amend its approach to precious metal holdings related to deposit-taking and clearing activities.""
It said it had introduced an ""interdependent precious metals permission"" which would reduce the size of the required capital buffer. 
""This is one of the key points that what we've been asking for all these years,"" said Sakhila Mirza, the LBMA's chief counsel. ""Clearing will be exempt."" 
The PRA said it would not classify gold as a high-quality liquid asset, which would have freed other trades such as precious metals loans and leases from the high capital requirement.
The LBMA says gold is liquid enough not to need an additional liquidity buffer for clearing and settlement and short-term transactions.

JPMorgan and HSBC declined to comment. ICBC Standard did not immediately respond late on Friday. 
A spokesperson for UBS said: ""UBS welcomes the PRA's decision, which supports stability in bullion cleaning and avoids disruption to the London market.""

The French government closely follows recommendations made by the Haute Autorite de la Sante (HAS), which also advised using mRNA-based  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines to slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant because they offered more protection than other shots.
""While the number of new cases and the pressure on the hospital system remain relatively low, the dynamic of the epidemic in France is significant and could quickly lead to a deterioration in the health situation,"" HAS said in a statement. 
President Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the nation on Monday on the progress of the epidemic and his government's strategy to dampen the impact of what many scientists say is an inevitable fourth wave.
Government officials have said in recent weeks that mandatory vaccination for health workers was being considered as the now-dominant Delta variant causes a sharp upturn in France's infection rate.
On Saturday, the country's National Medicine Academy, a doctors' society, pressed authorities to impose compulsory vaccination for everyone aged 12 and above.
HAS also said the government should start thinking about mandatory vaccination for the entire population, in order to be ready to take such a decision if it became necessary.
The body also recommended shortening the time period between the first and second vaccine doses and said people over 55 who received a first shot of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine should be given a second dose with an mRNA-based vaccine. 

After falling from more than 42,000 per day mid-April to less than 2,000 per day in late June, the seven-day average of new infections has been climbing rapidly again since early July. 
On Friday, the health ministry registered 4,580 new infections. In the past six days, the seven-day average number of new infections has increased by more than 50% every day, a pattern similar to the early phases of previous waves.

Tencent first announced plans to merge Huya and DouYu last year in a tie-up designed to streamline its stakes in the firms, which were estimated by data firm MobTech to have an 80% slice of a market worth more than $3 billion and growing fast.
Tencent is Huya's biggest shareholder with 36.9% and also owns over a third of DouYu, with both firms listed in the United States, and worth a combined $5.3 billion in market value.
Reuters first reported the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) plan to block the deal on Monday, which came after the regulator reviewed additional concessions proposed by Tencent for the merger.
SAMR said Huya and DouYu's combined market share in the video game live streaming industry would be over 70% and their merger would strengthen Tencent's dominance in this market, given Tencent already has over 40% market share in the online games operations segment.
Huya and DouYu are ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, as China's most popular video game streaming sites, where users flock to watch e-sports tournaments and follow professional gamers.
Tencent said in a statement it ""will abide by the decision, comply with all regulatory requirements, operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and fulfill our social responsibilities."" 
The deal termination comes amid an ongoing crackdown on Chinese tech companies from the government. Earlier this year, the anti-monopoly regulator placed a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.
DouYu said it ""fully respects the regulatory decision and actively cooperates with regulatory requirements to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.""
Huya did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a memo from SAMR published concurrently with the announcement, Zhang Chenying, a member of the state council's anti-trust committee, argued the deal would prevent fair competition.

""If Huya and DouYu are to merge, the original joint control of Douyu will become Tencent's complete control of a merged entity,"" Zhang wrote.
""Considering factors such as revenue, active users, livestreaming resources and other key indices, we can expect that a merger would eliminate or restrict fair competition.""

The security review will put a focus on risks of data being affected, controlled or manipulated by foreign governments after overseas listings, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said, posting the proposed rules on its website.
China's cyberspace regulators are imposing tighter restrictions on data collection and data storage. Authorities are also more broadly pushing for companies to list domestically.
Two new sets of rules, the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law, which cover data storage and data privacy respectively, are set to go into effect this year. 
Saturday's announcement will also require firms to submit the IPO materials they plan to file for review. 
The security review, according to the CAC, will consider national security risks as ""risk of supply chain interruption due to political, diplomatic, trade and other factors,"" and risk of key data ""maliciously used by foreign governments after listing in foreign countries.""
The CAC is seeking public opinion on the proposed rules.

The notice comes after Chinese authorities launched a probe of ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc for allegedly violating user privacy, just days after its listing in New York.
Didi's shares plunged 20% on news of the probe, and the company said its revenue would be affected.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2021 01:26AM ET</span>",Biden signs order to tackle corporate abuses across U.S. economy,"By Nandita Bose, Jarrett Renshaw and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order on Friday to promote more competition in the U.S. economy, urging agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor.
If fully implemented, the effort will help lower Americans' internet costs, allow for airline baggage fee refunds for delayed luggage, among other steps.
The order instructs antitrust agencies to focus on labor, healthcare, technology and agriculture as they address a laundry list of issues that have irritated consumers, and in the case of drug prices, has bankrupted some.
""No more tolerance of abusive actions by monopolies. No more bad mergers that lead to massive layoffs, higher prices and fewer options for workers and consumers alike,"" Biden said at a White House signing ceremony. 
The president noted areas where advocates feel that prices are too high, wages are tamped down or new businesses excluded from competition. ""Let me be very clear, capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation,"" he said.
The White House says the rate of new business formation has fallen by almost 50% since the 1970s as large businesses make it harder for Americans with good ideas to break into markets.
Biden's action goes after corporate monopolies across a broad swath of industries, and includes 72 initiatives he wants more than a dozen federal agencies to act on. 
Lower wages caused by lack of competition are estimated to cost the median American household $5,000 per year, according to a White House fact sheet that cites research from the American Economic Liberties Project - an influential Washington-based anti-monopoly group.
The initiatives will no doubt kick off a series of fights with the affected industries. 
The powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a statement saying the move ""smacks of a 'government knows best' approach to managing the economy"" and pledged to ""vigorously oppose calls for government-set prices, onerous and legally questionable rulemakings, efforts to treat innovative industries as public utilities, and the politicization of antitrust enforcement.""
INTERNET, HEARING AIDS
Among the administration's plans to open up the U.S. economy are new rules to mandate ending excessive internet contract termination fees, allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter and end non-compete clauses for millions of workers and many occupational licensing requirements. 
Biden's order pushes the Agriculture Department to act to stop what the White House called ""abusive practices of some meat processors,"" reacting to farmers and ranchers who sometimes say they face too few buyers for their animals.
The administration also seeks to make it easier for customers to switch banks and take their transaction data with them, and restore net neutrality rules that require companies to treat all internet services equally. 
Reuters first reported Biden's plan to issue a competition executive order in late June and subsequently published stories on how it will impact industries such as farm equipment manufacturers, banking, rail and sea shipping.
The executive order will direct the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to carefully review mergers, and to challenge prior deals that have closed.
It directs the FTC to issue rules to address competition concerns from Big Tech companies, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and limit ""killer acquisitions"" where large internet platforms acquire potential competitors.
FTC Chair Lina Khan and the acting head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, Richard Powers, said Friday that they would soon launch a review of merger guidelines to determine if they are ""overly permissive.""
On prescription drugs, it aims to lower prices for consumers by allowing importation of drugs from Canada, where they are cheaper. It also urges the Department of Health and Human Services to draw up a plan to fight high drug prices, and gouging. 

Evercore/ISI analyst Michael Newshel said in a research note that the impact of allowing imports from Canada on pricing would be limited given Canada's limited drug supply and that Canada has indicated in the past that it would not cooperate with any program. He said the government's decision to turn to executive orders on drug pricing was surprising given ongoing legislative efforts in Congress.
The executive order also establishes a White House Competition Council, led by the Director of the National Economic Council and including many cabinet secretaries, to monitor progress.

By Rozanna Latiff and Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's government and state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) are seeking over $5.6 billion in damages from KPMG partners for alleged breaches and negligence linked to a corruption scandal at the fund, court documents seen by Reuters showed.
Audit firm KPMG on Friday denied the allegations and pledged to ""vigorously"" contest the suit filed against 44 current and former partners and linked to its audit of 1MDB's financial statements between 2010 to 2012.
The suit, which the finance ministry confirmed had been filed on Tuesday, is the latest in a series of suits filed by Malaysian authorities to recover billions of dollars missing from 1MDB in a scandal that has implicated high-level officials, banks and financial institutions around the world.
""All allegations as reported in the news are refuted and the claim will be vigorously contested,"" KPMG said in an emailed statement to Reuters, noting it was ""disappointed"" with the suit.
Malaysia's finance ministry declined to comment further due to sub judice. In June, it said it was negotiating a settlement with the auditor.
Lawyers for 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that about $3.2 billion were misappropriated from 1MDB and its subsidiaries during the period KPMG served as the firm's auditor. 
The amount was part of a larger sum of $5.64 billion allegedly siphoned from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014 - losses that could have been avoided if KPMG had obtained sufficient evidence to support its audit findings, the plaintiffs allege.
A proper audit by KPMG would have identified fraud risk warning signs which the firm would have had a duty to report and which would have led to the discovery of the fraud at 1MDB sooner, the plaintiffs said. 
The plaintiffs said they would seek the full amount misappropriated, including interest accrued as well as additional costs. 
The Malaysian government and MoF Inc, a statutory body under the finance ministry, would also seek 2.63 billion ringgit ($627.83 million) from the KPMG partners to cover losses incurred in bailing out 1MDB.
KPMG was sacked as 1MDB's auditor after it refused to sign off on the fund's 2013 accounts. 
In June 2018, it said it had informed 1MDB to ""immediately take all necessary steps to prevent any further or future reliance on the audit reports prepared by KPMG Malaysia for the financial years ended 31 March 2010 to 31 March 2012"".
Deloitte PLT which took over as 1MDB's auditor after KPMG, paid $80 million to Malaysia's government last month to settle claims related to its dealings with 1MDB. 
At least six countries have opened investigations into 1MDB, co-founded by former prime minister Najib Razak. 

Last year, Najib was found guilty of corruption and money laundering in a 1MDB-linked case. He denies wrongdoing and is appealing the verdict.

Transair Flight 810 was found approximately 2 miles offshore from Ewa Beach. The major components of the airplane -- the aft fuselage including both wings and tail along with both engines, and forward fuselage -- were located on the sea floor at depths between 360 and 420 feet, the NTSB said in a statement.
The plane components were located with a Side Scan Sonar and Remotely Operated Vehicle, the NTSB said.
The NTSB said the wreckage is too deep to deploy divers for recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. The investigative team is developing plans to recover the aircraft.
The safety board said fuel samples from another airplane fueled on the same night were tested and no irregularities were found. The agency released photos of airplane components located on the ocean floor.
The two crew members on Transair Flight 810 were injuredafter being forced to land in the Pacific Ocean. One was taken to a hospital by helicopter and the other was rescued by boat.
The Boeing cargo plane was built in 1975.

The crew reported engine trouble and plans to turn backshortly after taking off at 1:33 a.m. local time from Daniel K.Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. The plane was en routeto the Hawaiian island of Maui.
The NTSB said its investigators have completed more than a dozen interviews including the flight crew, other Transair personnel, and Federal Aviation Administration employees.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>",Investors eager for earnings amid growth concerns,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking to U.S. companies' upcoming quarterly results and forecasts about the recovery in the second half of 2021 as some worry that the recent economic surge is already waning.
U.S. Treasuries rallied sharply this week on fears that economic growth may slow in the second half, pushing yields to levels not seen since February. On the stock market, there was a selloff in financials, energy and other so-called value shares tied to the recovery.
A massive jump in second quarter earnings is expected to mark a peak for U.S. earnings growth and the recovery from last year's pandemic-induced profit collapse. S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have surged 65.8% from a year earlier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
That's on track to be the biggest percentage growth since the fourth quarter of 2009 following the Great Financial Crisis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Starting Tuesday, earnings reports are due from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and other big banks, kicking off the quarterly results season. They could give early clues on the economy and stocks tied to growth.
Most big U.S. banks are expected to report a big rebound in quarterly profits even with trading income falling and revenue stalling on low interest rates and weak demand. 
Investors are also eager to assess whether earnings will support Wall Street's run higher, with the S&P 500 up roughly 16% for the year so far. Many market watchers say the expected surge in earnings this year is a big reason for the market's strong performance.
Yet this week's weaker-than-expected report on U.S. jobless claims and the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant added to investor questions about the economic re-opening.
""For this earnings season, what investors will want to see and what we expect is that the earnings trend for the value side is still intact, to give support to (the view) it's too early to leave this trade. And that starts with the banks next week,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.
Many investors including Lerner remained bullish on economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials and industrials that are considered value trades because of years of underperformance.The S&P 500 value index is down for the week. Over the same period, the S&P 500 growth index - known for companies with upward momentum behind them - is higher, reflecting an advance in technology shares that were helped by the fall in the benchmark 10-year note yields.
Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, who likes energy, materials, restaurants and some retailers, said while the picture is not all perfect across all companies, earnings season should confirm the strength in the economy. 
""It's not 100% rosy,"" he said, but ""we would expect earnings to be extremely strong, and so we're optimistic about the market.""
Among sectors, industrials, consumer discretionary, energy and materials are expected to post the biggest year-over-year profit gains, with industrials estimated up more than 500%, based on Refinitiv's data.
Second-quarter earnings estimates are likely still too low, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note this week. 
As a result, estimates for 2021 overall and for 2022 ""should continue to increase as we get Q2 financial reports,"" and that could give investors more confidence that earnings should support the market going into next year, he wrote.

Also on the radar will be what companies are doing to pass on price increases they may be grappling with from raw materials, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. Signs of these pressures have come up in economic data in recent months.
Other companies due to report next week include Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).

(Reuters) - Recent price rallies in U.S. government debt drove flows into exchange-traded funds tracking longer-dated Treasuries, according to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) ETF provider iShares. 
The iShares 20+ year Treasury Bond ETF attracted $1.4 billion of inflows in the past three weeks to Thursday, with around $447 million added in the last week. 
Comparatively, investors pulled $547 million out of the iShares 7-10 year Treasury Bond ETF over the same period, according to iShares fixed income investment strategist Dhruv Nagrath. 
""We see the balance of risks tilting toward higher yields as markets continue to price in the economic restart,"" he said. 
After steep declines earlier in the year, Treasuries have rallied over the past few weeks, sending the benchmark 10-year yield as low as 1.25% on Thursday. [US/]
BlackRock's Nagrath noted that recent pullbacks in inflation breakeven rates have increased flows into short-duration, inflation-linked TIPS bond funds, with those ETFs adding $7.7 billion in 2021. 
In total, iShares Treasury funds attracted $801 million of net inflows. However, funds tracking corporate debt were in more demand as investors sought higher yielding assets. 
iShares ETFs focused on investment-grade company debt recorded $873 million in inflows, while funds tracking high-yielding ""junk"" bonds have added $1.3 billion since mid-June, according to iShares data. 

The iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF was the biggest beneficiary, attracting inflows of over $700 million. HYG's shares have risen as high as $88 in the last week, levels last seen before the coronavirus-prompted selloff in March 2020. 
Globally, bond funds saw their biggest weekly inflow in over three months, according to Refinitiv Lipper data.

Deputy Commissioner David Black, also a Trump appointee, was asked to resign and complied, the White House official said.
Biden has appointed Kilolo Kijakazi as acting commissioner while the search for a commissioner and deputy commissioner is conducted, the official said. Kijakazi is currently the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy at the agency.
The Social Security Administration, which oversees programs that provide financial support to the elderly and disabled, referred questions about Saul and Black to the White House.
An attempt to reach Saul was unsuccessful. 
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a tweet prior to the announcement that firing Saul would be ""an unprecedented and dangerous politicization of the Social Security Administration.""

But Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee overseeing the agency, applauded their removal. ""They've been trying to destroy Social Security,"" he said on Twitter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes rallied to record closing highs on Friday as financials and other economically focused sectors rebounded from a selloff sparked by growth worries earlier in the week.
The rally allowed the indexes to notch slight gains for the week, which also saw a sharp rally in U.S. Treasuries as investors worried the U.S. economic recovery might be losing steam as the Delta variant of the coronavirus spread globally.
U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell on Friday, halting an eight-day price rise, while the S&P 500 financials sector jumped 2.9% in the sector's biggest daily percentage gain since March 1. 
Financials led sector advances followed by energy, materials and industrials. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will kick off the second-quarter earnings season next week when they report results.
""What an about-face from all of the gloom and doom from yesterday,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
""The U.S. is in a bubble compared to the rest of the world, in a break from COVID. How long that's going to last we don't know,"" he said, but ""until that narrative changes, this is a market with a lot of free money and low interest rates.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 448.23 points, or 1.3%, to 34,870.16, the S&P 500 gained 48.73 points, or 1.13%, to 4,369.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 142.13 points, or 0.98%, to 14,701.92.
For the week, the Dow is up 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each added 0.4%.
A big jump in quarterly earnings is expected to mark a peak for U.S. profit growth in the recovery from last year's pandemic-induced collapse. Investors are looking to U.S. companies' upcoming quarterly results and forecasts about the recovery in the second half of 2021 as some worry that the recent economic surge is already waning. 
Analysts expect earnings growth of 65.8% for companies in the S&P 500 index in the quarter, up from a previous forecast of 54% growth at the start of the period, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Among individual stocks,  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI) rose 1.4% as it forecast a strong full-year profit after beating quarterly earnings estimates on improving demand across its markets for jeans, tops, and jackets.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc gained 7.3% after four sessions of losses, as it was recently hit by an investigation from China's internet watchdog.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.51 billion shares, compared with the 10.5 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.33-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 32 new lows.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) -A Canadian judge has denied Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's application to add a trove of documents her legal team received from HSBC as evidence to her U.S. extradition case, the judge announced on Friday.
Meng, 49, is facing extradition from Canada to the United States on charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, potentially causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions. She has been held under house arrest in Vancouver since December 2018, when she was first detained.
Her legal team received over 300 pages of internal documents from HSBC through a court on Hong Kong, which the defence argued should be entered as evidence because they would disprove the basis for the United States' extradition claim.
Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes, who has been overseeing the case in the British Columbia Supreme Court since its inception, disagreed. Her reasons will be released in writing in approximately ten days, Holmes said.
""We respect the court's ruling, but regret this outcome,"" Huawei Canada said in a statement released after the ruling, insisting that the documents showed HSBC was aware of Huawei's business dealings in Iran, proving that the United States' account of the case was ""manifestly unreliable.""

The Canadian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meng is set to appear in court in early August. Her extradition hearings are scheduled to finish by the end of that month.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government will invest at least $500 million to expand beef, pork and poultry processing capacity, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Friday, after consumers faced limits on meat purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
The money from a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March will be awarded to meat processors in grants and loans to make the supply chain more resilient and increase competition in the sector, Vilsack said at a news conference in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order that pushes the U.S. Department of Agriculture to crack down on ""abusive practices of some meat processors"" and promote more competition in the U.S. economy.
Cattle ranchers say there are too few processing companies that buy livestock to turn into beef, sometimes forcing farmers to accept the one and only bid they receive for animals.
Ranchers are now selling cattle for a loss even though meat companies make profits selling beef to consumers, Vilsack said. 
""It seems to me in fairness profit ought to go both ways,"" he added. 
The meatpacking sector came under increased scrutiny after slaughterhouses closed temporarily during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as workers fell sick. 
When large meat plants close, meat supplies tighten while ranchers get stuck with cattle that would otherwise have been slaughtered. That means the price of cattle generally falls, while the price of meat in supermarkets rises.
A cyberattack against the North American arm of Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) that shut U.S. beef plants last month highlighted concerns about concentration in the sector.
Biden's order directs USDA to consider new rules to make it easier for farmers to bring and win legal claims against big processors. 
The USDA said in June it would pursue three rules to strengthen enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, passed 100 years ago to protect farmers from unfair trade practices. 

The North American Meat Institute, which represents meat companies, said on Friday that Biden's order will ""open the floodgates for litigation."" 
""Government intervention in the market will increase the cost of food for consumers at a time when many are still suffering from the economic consequences of the pandemic,"" said Meat Institute President Julie Anna Potts.

(Reuters) - Even in the depths of the 2009 financial crisis, it was never this bad for the owners of the world's biggest shopping malls. 
New real estate industry data for June reveals that vacancy rates in the United States' indoor malls could surpass those in suburban shopping centers and strip malls. 
The figures from property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle come on top of a series of bankruptcies and takeovers, which has seen even sector leader Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) hand back control of some buildings to creditors or take over broken retail operations for their debts.
The JLL data predicts that U.S. indoor mall vacancy rates will peak at just under 9% this year compared to 7.8% for outdoor shopping centers and 7% for ""power centers"", industry code for open-air centers anchored by big box retailers like Best Buy or  Target  (NYSE:TGT). 
Experts say that a deeper change is underway, with property owners focusing investment on open air locations and smaller stores in cheaper locations where shoppers can feel more at ease in the post-COVID world.
""The demand for space right now is higher than I've seen it in 15 years,"" said David Lukes, chief executive officer of SITE Centers (NYSE:SITC), who runs over a hundred power and shopping centers. 
Deals done or underway with retailers include Macy's (NYSE:M),  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), Bed Bath and Beyond, Warby Parker and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Bonobos. 
In Chicago, for example, Macy's has shut its sprawling store in the Water Tower Place building on Michigan Avenue's ""Magnificent Mile"", a magnet for thousands of shoppers and tourists every weekend for the past half century. 
The company is turning to modest buildings like its new ""Market by Macy's"", set on a canalside lot in Fort Worth, Texas and flanked by a steakhouse and a branch of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). 
In 2009, vacancy rates for the more downmarket properties peaked at 11% while malls still showed rates of just 5%. 
But for Macy's and others, the cost reward has become compelling: average annual rent for shopping centers in the first quarter of the year was $20.36 per square foot, as little as a third of the cost of big city centre malls. 
At Magnificent Mile, vacancy more than doubled to over 8% currently from 4% in late 2019. Rents fell by 2.5% over the past year to a still very high $62.30, according to industry data provider CoStar.
Alexander Levy, senior consultant at CoStar, said shopping centers in suburban areas have fared better than malls in urban areas since U.S. pandemic-related restrictions began to ease in the first quarter. 
Signet, Ethan Allen (NYSE:ETH) Interiors and Express are among those to have opened stores in suburban areas, ranging from the suburbs of San Mateo, California and Southlake to smaller towns like Westport, Connecticut and Towson, Maryland.
""We are experiencing the migration to the suburbs right now,"" said Conor Flynn, chief executive of U.S. investment trust  Kimco Realty  (NYSE:KIM), which owns nearly 400 open-air shopping centres and complexes based around grocery stores.
""I'm cautiously optimistic that the lion's share of what we've experienced is sticky.""

City center landlords have responded by turning some city malls into mixed use retail and residential buildings.
In Britain, Intu, owner of Manchester's Trafford Centre shopping that called in the administrators last year, said they had applied for permission to use its outdoor space for events, food stalls and an urban beach.
Others, like office and mall owner British Land, say they are now targeting ""last mile"" logistics, to get online orders to consumers' doorsteps as fast as possible. 
For ex-mall goer and Bay Area resident Ian Fagalar, it may all be too late: the Hilltop Mall he frequented as a kid in Richmond, California is now being converted for residential and other uses.

""Retail stores are dropping like flies,"" he says. ""I shop online 99% of the time now.""

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 05:36PM ET</span>","Treasury yields rise, U.S. stocks hit new highs; dollar weakens","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Treasury yields extended their rise on Friday while the three major U.S. stock indexes rallied to record closing highs, as markets relaxed a bit from fears of a slowing pace of economic recovery from COVID-19 that dominated trading for much of the week.
In currencies, the safe-haven yen weakened 0.32% versus the greenback at 110.14 per dollar, while the dollar index fell 0.205%, and the euro edged up 0.24% to $1.1871. 
Signs of risk relief were tempered, however, as spot gold, another safe-haven asset, logged its third straight weekly gain, rising 0.3% to $1,807.65 an ounce.
Concern about a faltering recovery, driven in part by the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, had reduced risk appetite early in the week and prompted flight-to-safety bond buying, with some betting the reflation trade had stalled.
That action helped push 10-year U.S. government bond yields to a 4-1/2 month low on Thursday. Data released on Friday showed investors through July 6 were reducing short bond positions, which also weighed on yields. 
Still, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 7.7 basis points to 1.365% on Friday.
""The downward pressure in yields from continual buying just frankly ran out of steam ... at these levels,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
Stocks rose as financials and other economically focused sectors rallied from the selloff sparked by growth worries earlier in the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 448.23 points, or 1.3%, to 34,870.16, while the broad S&P 500 gained 48.73 points, or 1.13%, to 4,369.55.
The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite added 142.13 points, or 0.98%, to 14,701.92.
Investors will next gauge risk appetite by assessing results of auctions of $38 billion of 10-year Treasury notes on Monday, and $24 billion of 30-year bonds on Tuesday.
""If auction demand is a little bit squishy, especially at the 10-year sale, then we could see 1.45% in a hurry,"" LeBas said, referring to the effect on the 10-year Treasury yield if investors resume selling. 
Concerns remain that vaccination alone won't squelch the virus enough to get economies back to normal. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech said they plan to ask regulators to authorize a booster dose of their vaccine, based on evidence of greater risk of infection six months after inoculation and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.
That has stoked fears ""that in the fall, we might be shutting down again,"" said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York.

Aligned against such fears: loose monetary policy from major central banks. But that support may vanish if inflation spikes.
Oil prices added to overnight gains as U.S inventories declined. U.S. crude was up 2.3% to $74.62 per barrel and Brent was at $75.58, up 1.97% on the day.

Given this backdrop, we believe mid-cap oil exploration companies Apache (APA), ARC Resources (AETUF), and  PDC Energy  (NASDAQ:PDCE) should see a substantial rise in their revenues and profit margins in the near term. Let’s discuss.
Supply cuts and rising demand with the reopening of economic activities have recently driven crude oil prices to six-year highs. And oil prices are expected to continue moving higher as supply cuts remain in place because OPEC+ failed to reach a production agreement.
OPEC+’s proposal to increase oil production for August has been postponed because Saudi Arabia and the UAE remain at loggerheads over the oil output. In light of these developments, former U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette expects oil to hit $100 a barrel soon.
This, coupled with declining inventories, should help mid-cap oil companies Apache Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), ARC Resources Ltd. (AETUF), and PDC Energy, Inc. (PDCE) generate higher revenues and profits in the near term. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department on Friday released proposed new rules to require passenger airlines to refund fees for bags that are significantly delayed and refunds for services like onboard Wi-Fi that do not work.
The proposal, which will open for public comment for 60 days, came shortly after President Joe Biden signed an executive order to boost competition throughout the economy.
That order also directs U.S. regulators to review airport slots and aviation market structure issues.
White House economic adviser Bharat Ramamurti said ""it is our goal to have more competition in the airline industry.""
Rules on the allocation of airport slots have big ramifications for airline competition and market access for low-cost carriers.
Under existing U.S. rules, passengers are entitled to a fee refund if bags are lost, but not when delayed.
Under the proposed rule, a “significantly delayed checked bag” is one not delivered to the passenger within 12 hours for domestic itineraries and within 25 hours for international itineraries.
The department estimates consumers could see $10.7 million to $11.4 million annually in refunded baggage fees and estimates carriers costs at around $4 million.
That is just a tiny fraction of baggage revenue.
U.S. airlines collected approximately $5.8 billion in baggage fees and $2.8 billion in change and cancelation fees in 2019, up from just $464 million in baggage fees and $915 million in change and cancellation fees in 2007.
Airlines for America, a group representing major airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, wrote White House economic adviser Brian Deese on Thursday to discuss the proposals.
The group said Friday that ""robust competition in the U.S. airline industry has generated unprecedented levels of affordability and accessibility, benefiting the customer at every level.""
The order says the department should evaluate ""existing commercial aviation programs, consumer protections"" and to consult with the Justice Department ""to ensure competition in air transportation and the ability of new entrants to gain access.""
It also directs considering ""measures to support airport development and increased capacity and improve airport congestion management, gate access... and 'slot' administration.""
The administration proposal would require airlines to promptly refund fees – such as for advance seat selection, Wi-Fi and other flight services – if passengers do not receive the service or it does not work.

The Transportation Department also intends to issue a separate proposed rule to require upfront disclosure of baggage fees, change fees and cancellation fees.
The department must also submit a report within 45 days ""to address the failure of airlines to provide timely refunds for flights cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."" In June, the department said was seeking a $25.5 million fine from Air Canada over what it said was the carrier’s failure to provide timely refunds to thousands of U.S. consumers.

The S&P 500 rose 1.1% to a closing record high of 4,369.55. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.30%, or 447 points, and the Nasdaq was up 0.92%, with closing at record highs.
The U.S. bond yields found their footing as the 10-year yield recovered from a slip below 1.3% a day earlier. The move higher in yields sparked a bid in regional banking stocks, lifting the overall financial sector more than 2% higher.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT),  Capital One  Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) were among the biggest gains, up more than 4%.
Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
The rally in banking stocks comes just days before major Wall Street banks kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest on Tuesday. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are scheduled to report its fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) will report results on Wednesday.
Wall Street will be watching for any guidance from banks on loan growth for the second half of the year following softness in the first half amid record consumer savings.   
""Average loan growth to be under pressure in 2Q, but pay attention to end of-period (EOP) loan balances because if EOP is above the average it should foreshadow stronger loan growth in 2H21,"" Wedbush said in a note. ""We expect positive commentary related to rebuilding loan pipelines to pre-pandemic levels and increased business activity supporting a pickup in loan growth in 2H21.    
Tech stocks, meanwhile, also benefitted from strength in semiconductor stocks with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), and  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) rising.
Big tech shrugged off further regulatory threats after President Joe Biden signed an order to increase competition in the biggest industries including tech.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were above the flatline. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was slightly lower.

The rise in oil has driven energy stock prices up as well. The current dip in prices and a strong outlook presents a great buying opportunity to pick up shares of Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG).Crude oil prices have risen sharply this year as demand increased significantly once global economies reopened. The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), which tracks Light Sweet Crude Oil, is up 48% in 2021. The rise in oil prices helped drive prices of energy stocks up, with the SPDR Select Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) gaining over 41% year to date.
On Monday this week, an OPEC meeting was called off as countries couldn't agree on an increase in output for July. I see this as bullish for oil prices and energy stock prices. As another meeting won't occur until later this year, this rebound in oil and energy has more room to run. 
Though prices are down this week, after the ISM services survey came in weaker than expected, I see this as a temporary blip and a great time to buy energy stocks on the dip. The outlook for oil consumption isn't changing. The EIA predicts global oil consumption will top 100 million barrels per day later in the year. This is why I think investors should consider Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), two energy stocks that rank highly in our POWR Ratings system.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on Friday charged three men with insider trading ahead of Long Island Iced Tea Corp's announcement it would change its name to Long Blockchain Corp, and change its focus to blockchain from iced tea and lemonade, which caused its shares to soar nearly 400%.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Eric Watson, who controlled more than 30% of Long Island Iced Tea shares, leaked the news to his friend and broker Oliver-Barret Lindsay (NYSE:LNN), who passed it to his friend Gannon Giguiere, a stock promoter.
According to the SEC, Giguiere bought 35,000 Long Island Iced Tea shares on Dec. 20, 2017, and sold them the next day for a $162,500 profit less than two hours after the Farmingdale, New York-based company's self-described ""pivot"" became public.
Long Island Iced Tea's share price rose as much as 388% that day, boosting its market capitalization to $92.6 million from $23.8 million.
The SEC said a colleague of Lindsay's asked him in a chat message that day why he wasn't told in advance to buy Long Island Iced Tea, and Lindsay replied: ""I think I told everyone.""
Lawyers for Lindsay and Giguiere did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Watson could not immediately be located.
The SEC said Watson, 60, is a New Zealand citizen believed to live in London; Lindsay, 44, is a Canadian living in Vancouver; and Giguiere, 47, lives in Newport Coast, California.
It is seeking to impose civil fines and recoup illegal profits. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court.

Long Island Iced Tea's changes were part of trend of companies reshaping their business models to profit from blockchain technology, which supports cryptocurrencies.
The case is SEC v Watson et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-05923.

Hoggett has been with Tesco, the UK's biggest retailer, for over 31 years and is currently chief strategy and innovation director.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said Hoggett will join in January 2022 as senior vice president of physical stores, reporting to Dave Clark, chief executive of its worldwide consumer business.
""Over the next few months we’ll put together a plan for Tony’s transition to Amazon,"" Clark said in a statement.
Hoggett started his career at Tesco as a 16-year-old trolley boy. Over three decades he rose to become CEO Asia and then group chief operating officer before starting his latest role in April.
""It was a big decision to move on from Tesco but after meeting members of the Amazon leadership team and hearing the ambitions for the business and physical stores, I know it’s a journey and an opportunity that I want to be part of,"" said Hoggett, who will relocate to Seattle.
For Tesco, it is the first high profile departure since Ken Murphy became CEO in October.
Alan Stewart retired as finance chief in April this year but his exit was announced in June 2020. Similarly Charles Wilson stepped down as boss of Tesco's Booker business in February, having announced his departure in September.

Amazon's move comes as investors have speculated it may be interested in a bid for Tesco's smaller rival Morrisons, with whom the U.S. company has a supplier partnership agreement.
Amazon in March opened its first physical store outside the United States, an Amazon Fresh cashierless location in London, and now has five of the outlets in the UK.

Against a backdrop of continuing product launches and collaborations, both Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to benefit handsomely. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are two well-established players in the technology space. With a $2.08 trillion market capitalization, MSFT develops, supports, licenses and sells a range of software products, services and solutions worldwide. It also designs, manufactures, and sells devices that include PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices and related accessories. NVDA designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software that are used in the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive markets. It has a market capitalization of $495.98 billion.
While the technology industry witnessed a sell-off earlier this year, the continuation of remote working, at least in-part, along with a rising need for advanced technology by almost all industries, is motivating investors to bet on this space again. The resurgence of COVID-19 in several countries is also increasing investors’ optimism about the industry’s prospects. Investors’ interest in this space is evident in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF’s (IYW) 7.3% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 2.1% returns. So, we believe both MSFT and NVDA, owing to their market dominance and fundamental strength, should benefit substantially in the coming months.
While MSFT gained 9.8% over the past month, NVDA returned 14%. In terms of their past six month’s performance, NVDA is a clear winner with 49.9% gains versus MSFT’s 26.3% returns. So, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Despite these gains, there is more upside as demand is strong, and companies are not increasing production or investing in new supply.Like many assets, oil has had a stunning turnaround since the depths of the coronavirus. In April 2020 the front-month contract actually went negative as many traders were forced to sell at a loss to avoid taking delivery. Of course, demand was also collapsing due to the coronavirus, shutdowns, and restrictions in mobility in many parts of the world. It resulted in record inventories, and companies paying exorbitant amounts of money to store oil on tankers.
A little more than a year later, the situation is quite different, as oil prices are at multi-year highs with the front-month contract reaching $75 per barrel. This is evident with the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) which is up 193% from its lows during last spring. 
Inventories have been drawn down, while demand is nearly at pre-pandemic levels, despite continued COVID-19 restrictions in many parts of the world. If things continue to normalize and travel volumes continue improving, then demand is likely to continue growing. While demand has rebounded, supply has not rebounded. In fact, CAPEX in the energy sector has been low for many years due to the impact of shale production over the last decade. Based on the lack of new production and supply constraints, I believe that oil prices could reach new highs in the coming years.

(Reuters) - Stock-trading app Robinhood Markets Inc is giving its billionaire founders four more years to hit share price targets that trigger stock awards worth $1.4 billion, according to a regulatory filing and four executive compensation experts who reviewed it.
The company had agreed to award CEO Vladimir Tenev and chief creative officer Baiju Bhatt 13.8 million shares contingent on its share price reaching certain price levels at the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the executive compensation experts who analyzed the filing told Reuters in interviews.
Robinhood tweaked the terms of the stock awards in late May so the founders will get a second chance to receive the shares if the IPO price does not meet the thresholds under the plan, according to the filing and the executive compensation experts. 
The change could cost Robinhood roughly $569.1 million in accounting expenses over time, according to the filing and one of the compensation experts. The company made the change to ""maintain the incentives"" of the stock award program, the filing states.
Sarah Anderson, a program director at the Institute for Policy Studies whose research focuses on executive pay and inequality, said Robinhood's IPO would add to the wealth of Tenev, 34, and Bhatt, 36, thanks to their stakes in the company, and that changing the stock award terms to reward them further was questionable. 
""Once you are already a billionaire, how much more of an incentive is this going to be for you to do a good job,"" Anderson said. Forbes pegs the net worth of Tenev and Bhatt at $1 billion each.
A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment or to make Tenev and Bhatt available for interviews.
Under the original plan, Robinhood would have to be priced at a minimum of $30.45 per share in the IPO for Tenev and Bhatt to receive some stock, according to the filing and the executive compensation experts. It would have to be priced at $101.50 per share for Tenev and Bhatt to each receive the entire stock award worth $1.4 billion. 
Robinhood has not yet disclosed its targeted IPO price range, but in the filing it said that its board determined the fair value of its shares was $16.33 at the end of December. Under the modified plan, Tenev and Bhatt will have until the end of 2025 to hit the share price targets, the filing showed. 
Some executive compensation experts defended the changes that Robinhood made. The amended stock award program may be a better way for Robinhood to get the most out of its founders for the benefit of its shareholders long-term, even if it ends up costing the company, according to Eric Hoffmann, a vice president at compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC. 
This is because tying the awards solely to the IPO could have enticed the founders to keep the company private until they could hit the share price targets or push for an unsustainable valuation in the stock market debut.
""This does incentivize them over a longer period of time to drive up the stock price and increase shareholder value. A lot of people would argue that's a good thing,"" Hoffmann said.
COURTING IPO INVESTORS
The corporate governance arrangements of technology startups, including their executive compensation structures, are often scrutinized by IPO investors. Robinhood is expected to launch its IPO later this month, seeking to capitalize on an amateur investor frenzy for so-called meme stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) that fueled a fourfold jump in its trading revenue in the first quarter.
""Changing 'in-flight' equity awards is often viewed negatively by investors,"" said Yonat Assayag, a partner at executive pay consultant ClearBridge Compensation Group LLC.
More stock awards could be in the offing for the founders. In late May, Robinhood approved additional stock grants for Tenev and Bhatt tied to more ambitious share price goals ranging from $120 to $300, according to the filing. For Tenev, the value of the awards is $4.7 billion, and for Bhatt, $2.8 billion.

Robinhood said in the filing that Tenev and Bhatt would not be granted any other equity awards through the eighth anniversary from when they received some of the stock, unless there are ""changes in circumstance or in our business."" 
Tenev and Bhatt, who founded Robinhood in 2013, slashed their annual base salaries in April from $400,000 to $34,248, which was the median wage for U.S. workers in 2019.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>","Stellantis in lithium supply deals with California, German firms -sources","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest automaker with brands that include Jeep and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), has signed memorandums of understanding for lithium supply with geothermal brine projects in California and Germany, according to two sources.
Automakers across the globe have been jockeying for access to lithium, a key ingredient used to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries. They also want the metal to be produced with as little carbon footprint as possible.
Stellantis said this week it plans to invest more than 30 billion euros ($35.54 billion) through 2025 on electrifying its vehicle lineup.
The agreements are with privately held Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR) Ltd, which operates in California's Salton Sea about 160 miles (258 km) southeast of Los Angeles, and Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd, which operates in Germany's Black Forest area of southwestern Germany, according to the sources.
Stellantis had said on Thursday that it had signed the agreements, but did not name the companies. The French-Italian automaker declined to comment on Friday.
Spokespersons for Vulcan and CTR, both with offices in Australia, could not be immediately reached during overnight hours.
Geothermal projects typically involve extracting super-hot lithium-rich brine from underground reservoirs and using the heat to produce electricity, after which lithium is extracted from the brine. 
The brine is then reinjected into the earth, making the process more sustainable than open-pit mines and brine evaporation ponds, the two most-common existing methods to produce the white metal.

The process is increasingly getting attention from major global automakers, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which last week said it would invest in CTR's California project. CTR has said it could be producing 60,000 tonnes of lithium - enough to make roughly 6 million EVs, depending on design - by 2024.
Vulcan has said it will invest 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) to build geothermal power stations and facilities to extract lithium in Germany, with a goal of hitting output of 55,000 tonnes of the white metal per year.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s supervisory board was discussing a two-year extension to Diess' contract, which would have expired in 2023, after two attempts last year failed over ongoing resistance by labour representatives.
By staying on until 2025 Diess will be able to see through an ambitious goal Europe's largest carmaker has set itself by the middle of the decade, namely becoming the world's leading electric vehicle player and overtaking key rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The supervisory board, which approved the contract extension at a meeting on Friday, also received a presentation from management on the company's new ""Strategy 2030"" to be made public next week.
""The Supervisory Board believes that under the leadership of Dr. Diess conditions will be optimal for the continued successful development of the entire company in the coming years as well, especially in view of Strategy 2030,"" said VW chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch.
VW said the new strategy was focused on an ""automotive industry shaped by e-mobility and software"". The board said it saw the strategy as ""the basis for future growth"".
Since becoming CEO in April 2018, Diess has accelerated the pace of reform to raise margins, cut costs and get serious about software and battery cells - two major areas of future vehicle production where German carmakers lack expertise.

Osterloh, once Germany's most powerful labour boss, had been Diess' fiercest opponent and was at loggerheads with the 62-year old over his aggressive management style.
He left Volkswagen's supervisory board earlier this year to join the management board of Volkswagen's trucks unit Traton.

(Reuters) - Does Elon Musk control Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc or does Tesla control Elon Musk?
More than $2 billion hinges on that question as a trial kicks off on Monday. Shareholders allege that Musk used his control of Tesla to force the company in 2016 to rescue SolarCity, saving the solar panel maker - and Musk's investment in the company - from bankruptcy.
The union pension funds and asset managers leading the case want Musk to repay to Tesla the cost of the $2.6 billion deal and to disgorge the profits on his SolarCity stock. If they win, it would be one of the largest judgments against an individual. 
The two-week trial in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware, will boil down to whether Musk, who owned about 22% of Tesla at the time of the deal, is that rare controlling stockholder who does not hold a majority stake.
""I think it's going to be very hard for the court to ignore the reality that Elon Musk is Elon Musk and his relationship with Tesla,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane University Law School.
She said the case might present an unusual situation given Musk's celebrity status, his personal ties to Tesla board members and those board members' financial ties to SolarCity.
""Put it all together, and it might be enough to count as a controlling shareholder,"" she said. 
Few executives dominate their company's image as much Musk, known for taunting regulators, battling naysayers and personally engaging with his 57 million Twitter followers.
""We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer,"" said Tesla's 2020 annual report. 
Plaintiffs allege that Musk drove the negotiations and even pushed Tesla's board to raise, not lower, the price for SolarCity.
A higher price benefited Musk, who was the largest shareholder of SolarCity, with a stake of about 22%, as well as four members of Tesla's board, who directly or indirectly owned SolarCity stock, according to court records.
Board members settled allegations against them last year for $60 million and did not admit to any fault.
Plaintiffs also allege the deal benefited two of Musk's cousins who founded SolarCity, saving a company that was rapidly running low on cash.
Musk has said he was ""fully recused"" from board negotiations and that shareholders voted to approve the deal because it was central to his ""Master Plan, Part Deux"" that aims to integrate sustainable solar energy with electric self-driving cars.
He has said that what plaintiffs see as evidence of control is little more than strong management.
""Taken to its natural conclusion, virtually all 'hands-on' and 'inspirational' CEOs with minority stock ownership would be deemed controllers,"" Musk's lawyers wrote in a court filing.
If Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights determines Musk was a controlling shareholder, it will fall to Musk to prove the SolarCity deal met the high bar of the ""entire fairness"" standard, which examines process and price, said legal experts.

Musk has noted in court papers that the SolarCity deal has been a huge success for Tesla shareholders, demonstrating the deal was not only fair, but a boon. After Tesla split its stock 5-1 in 2020, it has risen to $652 on Thursday from near $37 a share when the deal closed in November 2016. 
""If the vice chancellor thinks this deal was awful and was not effectively negotiated on behalf of the company, he’ll strike it down,"" said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly one fifth of votes cast at Sainsbury's annual shareholders' meeting on Friday opposed the British supermarket group's remuneration report in the latest investor protest against executive pay.
Ahead of the meeting investor advisory groups had recommended shareholders vote against the report because the board's remuneration committee opted to apply some upward discretion to payouts for 2020-21.
Investors have become more vocal in their opposition to boardroom pay deals they deem excessive amid society's broader struggles in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last month investors in Morrisons overwhelmingly rejected the grocer's pay report.
Sainsbury's said 19.4% of votes cast were against the resolution to approve the pay report, while 80.6% were in favour.
It noted the opposition.
""The remuneration committee regularly consults with our major shareholders in order to understand their views on key decisions, and we will continue this dialogue in future years,"" it said.
At the meeting, held both physically and virtually, Chairman Martin Scicluna was asked if Sainsbury's was vulnerable to a takeover following Morrisons' decision to agree a 6.3 billion pound ($8.7 billion) private equity buyout but declined to be drawn on the matter.
""What I can say is what we're doing, and what we're doing is very very clearly (focusing) on the strategy that (CEO) Simon (Roberts) has laid out which was approved by the board and on the execution of that plan,"" he said.
""We are very pleased with the progress that we are making and the operational improvements that we're making to the business and we're also very pleased that the market recognises that - and you will have seen and noted the share price outperformance over the last few months.""
Shares in Sainsbury's are up 26% so far this year.

Bid speculation has swirled around the group since April when Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake to just under 10% and has been fuelled over the last three weeks by a potential bid battle for Morrisons.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 12:56PM ET</span>",Cigarette maker Philip Morris to buy UK producer of respiratory treatments,"By Yadarisa Shabong and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -Tobacco group Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) agreed on Friday to buy Vectura for 1.05 billions pounds ($1.44 billion), giving the U.S. firm access to the British drugmaker's respiratory ailment treatments and inhaling device technology.
The move by Philip Morris is the latest push by big tobacco companies to change their image following years of negative press and lawsuits for marketing and selling cigarettes, a product that health advocates and experts say continues to be a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide.
The offer of 150 pence per share to investors in Vectura topped a previous 136 pence proposal by investment firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), and was 11% higher than the drugmaker's closing share price on Thursday. 
Vectura, whose shares rose as much as 14% to 154 pence, said it was withdrawing its recommendation for Carlyle's proposal and was adjourning a shareholder meeting it had convened on Monday. 
Philip Morris aims to use Vectura's expertise with inhalable formulations and device design to produce a range of over-the-counter and prescription-based respiratory therapies, it said in a statement.
It has set a target to generate more than 50% of its revenue from smoke-free products and at least $1 billion from products beyond nicotine by 2025 as part of its ""evolution into a broader healthcare and wellness company"".
Vectura makes approved inhaled medicines and associated devices to treat respiratory illnesses such as asthma, and counts Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc among its customers. 
""On the one hand Phillip Morris’ determination to accelerate the end of smoking might seem like turkeys voting for Christmas but as more and more people shift to 'healthier' lifestyles they would have eventually found themselves obsolete,"" AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson said.
""The move to scoop up Vectura from under the nose of Carlyle is part of a carefully thought out shift to smoke free products and investing in devices that will make lives better for people suffering from respiratory problems and gives good PR.""
BIDDING WAR
Carlyle said it was ""considering its options and a further announcement will be made in due course"", raising the prospect of a bidding war. In the meantime, it encouraged Vectura shareholders to take no action.
Peel Hunt analysts said Philip Morris' bid underscored the value of Vectura's technology platform, reducing the likelihood of a counter bid by private equity.
Other tobacco majors  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) (BAT (LON:BATS)) and Altria have also set ambitious targets to switch customers from smoking to less harmful e-cigarettes, cannabis and tobacco-heating products but with varying degrees of success. 
While BAT is seeing a benefit from more smokers switching to its e-cigarettes,  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) has seen its $12.8 billion investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs nosedive after regulators started taking a much harder stance on vaping products. Altria on Friday also announced it was selling its wine business.
Winston cigarette maker Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) Plc, in contrast, has scaled down its ambitions with vaping devices and other alternative nicotine products, and is doubling down on cigarettes as it embarks on a five-year turnaround plan. 
The deal is Philip Morris' second acquisition in the past week, after agreeing to buy nicotine gum maker Fertin Pharma for 5.1 billion Danish Krone ($812 million).
The U.S. company said Vectura will operate as an independent unit and will be the backbone of its inhaled therapeutics unit.

(Reuters) - Europe's drug regulator has found a possible link between very rare heart inflammation and COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), it said on Friday, stressing that the benefits of the shots outweighed any risks. 
The conditions, myocarditis and pericarditis, must be listed as side-effects of the two mRNA vaccines, the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said, adding that such cases primarily occurred within 14 days of inoculation.
It said cases occurred more often after the second dose and in younger adult men. This is in line with U.S. findings last month.
Symptoms from the conditions include breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain. 
EMA's safety panel also advised that people with a history of the rare blood disorder capillary leak syndrome (CLS), must not be vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s shot.
While the regulator cautioned healthcare professionals and people to be on the lookout for post-vaccine symptoms, it said it was continuously monitoring the safety of approved vaccines as they are rolled out more widely.
""EMA confirms that the benefits of all authorised COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh their risks,"" it said. 
EMA in total reviewed more than 300 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in the European Union, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - together referred to as the European Economic Area (EEA). 
Most cases occurred with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine, called Comirnaty, the watchdog said. 
SIDE-EFFECTS 
Roughly 177 million doses of Comirnaty had been given in the EEA as of May 31, compared to 20 million doses of Moderna's Spikevax vaccine, EMA said.
The cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were ""generally mild,"" and individuals ""tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest,"" Pfizer said in a statement.
EMA had also been looking into such cases with J&J and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines, but on Friday said it had not found any causal relationship so far and had asked for more data from the drugmakers.
Both J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines use similar technology but with different versions of a cold virus to deliver immunity-building instructions to the body. 
EMA in June asked CLS to be added as a side-effect of AstraZeneca's shot, Vaxzevria.
The regulator then too said people who had previously sustained the condition, in which fluids leak from the smallest blood vessels causing swelling and a drop in blood pressure, should not receive the shot.
For J&J, EMA reviewed three cases of CLS which occurred within two days of vaccination. 

The developments could put pressure on vaccination plans in Europe and on the U.S. company after millions of doses of the vaccine were banned for EU use over safety concerns following a contamination incident in the United States. 
J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>","European stocks rise on bargain-hunting, erase weekly losses","(Reuters) - European stocks jumped more than 1% on Friday, posting their best session in two months and erasing all of this week's losses, as investors sought bargains after one of the worst sell-offs this year on global economic recovery worries.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 1.3%, with sectors that took a hit earlier this week such as automakers and miners surging 4% and 3.4%, respectively. The mining sector marked its best session in two months. 
French stocks rose by the most in four months, advancing 2.1% and leading gains among major European bourses. 
Banks were up 2.4%, but were the hardest hit this week as government bond yields dropped. [GVD/EUR] 
A fresh surge in COVID-19 cases and underwhelming U.S. and Chinese economic data raised concerns about the strength of the recovery, boosting bonds and sending the benchmark STOXX 600 1.1% lower on the week until Friday's gains negated those losses. 
But with France saying the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 will probably account for most new coronavirus cases in the country from this weekend, and Spain's tourism hotspots asking the government to bring back curfews, the path out of a pandemic-induced economic slump still looks challenging.
""This sort of angst is nothing new for markets. However, the slide in yields is telling us that the recovery is either in trouble, or merely being delayed,"" CMC Markets' Michael Hewson said in a note. 
""Much is likely to depend on the vaccine rollout plans, and the speed with which it can be rolled out in the countries where cases are rising sharply.""
UK airlines such as British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Ryanair rose between 0.5% and 1.9%, as Britain planned to scrap quarantine for fully-vaccinated arrivals from other countries in the coming weeks.
Data released earlier showed UK's post-lockdown economic rebound slowed sharply in May despite an easing of COVID-related restrictions.
French planemaker Airbus gained 3.4% after it reported a 52% jump in deliveries in the first half of the year.
British luxury goods group Burberry rose 3.8% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to ""buy"", while Italian rival Salvatore Ferragamo slipped 0.7% after the U.S. bank downgraded it to ""sell"". 

Investors will now turn their focus to the earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week. The bulk of the European companies are expected to report later this month, with analysts forecasting a near-109% surge in second-quarter profit for STOXX 600 companies, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Indeed, the global cannabis market is expected to hit $118.9 billion in 2027, growing at a 28.5% CAGR from 2021.
As state-level cannabis legalization has gained significant traction, several multi-state operators have been able to capture these new markets and grow their sales significantly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s legal challenge to the Defense Department's 2019 decision to award a $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing project to rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the Pentagon canceled the contract. 
Amazon.com had accused then-President Donald Trump, alleging that the former president exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon. The Pentagon said on Tuesday it expected the new multi-billion dollar contract would be split between Amazon and Microsoft. 
Amazon did not object to dismissing its 2019 lawsuit.
Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims agreed to dismiss the lawsuit at the government's request, saying the case was now moot.
Trump publicly derided then-Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company. Amazon had sought to question Trump about his role in the contract decision.
The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC).
John Sherman, acting chief information officer for the Defense Department, said on Tuesday he expects both Microsoft and Amazon will get cloud contracts.
Microsoft said in a statement that the company was confident it will ""continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work.""
Amazon's Amazon Web Services cloud unit said it agreed with the Pentagon's decision to cancel the contract. It said the initial award was ""not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.""

In April, Campbell-Smith refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award to Microsoft after putting it on hold indefinitely in February 2020.
The now-canceled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was budgeted for as much as $10 billion and was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: What is open banking?,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order on Friday that asks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules giving consumers full control of their financial data to make it easier for them to switch lenders.
The measure was seen as a big win for financial technology startups in the United States and other proponents of ""open banking.""
What does open banking mean and what is its significance?
Open banking describes the process of banks and other traditional financial institutions giving customers and third parties easy digital access to their financial data. This includes being able to download and share information about account balances, payments, transactions and investments.
The term can also refer to allowing a third party to initiate transactions from a customer's account, such as sending a payment or withdrawing money.
Why would I want to share my financial data with a third party?
Consumers may want to share their banking data with other providers to get better and cheaper services than what they already have.
For example, an online wealth management startup might be able to offer better financial advice with a full picture of a consumer's assets and liabilities. To do so smoothly, it would need access to all the information in digital form, and in real time.
Easy access to data also, in theory, makes it easier for customers to leave one provider for another. Quickly moving information like direct debit instructions or frequent payees removes some of the burdens that prevent people from switching banks.
Why does open banking matter?
Proponents say customers should have access to their data so that they can get cheaper and better services. Open banking would also foster greater competition, they say, and customers, not banks, should get to decide who sees their information.
Critics, including many in the banking world, argue that the industry is already competitive and that privacy and cybersecurity concerns should supercede other considerations. Because it is expensive to maintain and protect customer data, banks have also resisted giving away the information for free.

Have regulators stepped in before?
Yes. European and UK regulators have mandated that https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-payment-regulation-facts-idUSKBN1EZ2CY, with customers' permission, banks must allow outside companies to access transaction history and take payments directly from an account.

Nevertheless, enterprise marketing software provider Marin Software Incorporated (MRIN) has yet to recover from COVID-19 pandemic-led damages. In its last reported quarter, the company reported a 27.2% year-over-year decline in net revenue to $6.31 million. Its net loss came in at $2.21 million. And while the stock has surged 1,017% over the past month on the meme stock craze, we think its deteriorating financial performance could cause it to suffer a price pullback soon.
Conversely, given the advertising industry’s solid growth prospects, it could be prudent to bet on fundamentally sound companies in this space Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG).

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra issued the order ""in the interest of safe railway operations, and to protect public safety for the temporary return of residents to inspect their homes in Lytton, British Columbia,"" the statement said.
Residents were due to return to Lytton on Friday to see what was left after a fire ravaged the town last week. The blaze started after a heat wave in which Lytton broke Canada's more than 80-year-old heat record with a 49.6-degree Celsius (121.3-degree Fahrenheit) temperature. 
There are currently 210 wildfires burning in B.C., an increase of 26 from two days ago, according to official data.
The order, which took effect on Friday, will affect lines used by both the Canadian National Railway and  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway, according to the statement.
Shipments of goods in and out of the Port of Vancouver have been delayed after wildfires damaged railway tracks.

Consequently, the stock has gained 16.3% year-to-date. But does the stock have more upside to deliver? Read on to find out.
Incorporated in 2004, Yelp Inc. (YELP) is a social networking platform that connects local businesses, including restaurants, shopping, beauty and other categories, with consumers in the United States and internationally. The company’s increasing investment in product innovation and its efficient go-to-market approach have allowed it to cater to the needs of businesses as they recover from the pandemic-induced downturn.
In May, YELP’s restaurant bookings surged above their pre-COVID-19 levels in nearly every U.S. state largely because an increasing number of restaurant owners are embracing digital platforms to boost their sales.
A substantial improvement in consumer foot traffic as pandemic restrictions have eased, coupled with YELP’s initiatives to boost its self-serve advertising channel, position it to take full advantage of the uptick in business activities. The stock has gained 16.3% year-to-date to close yesterday’s trading session at $38.00. As demand from retail and other businesses continues to surge, YELP is well positioned to maintain its growth and deliver solid returns.

However, the stock has generated tepid interest among investors so far due to concerns surrounding an anticipated tightening of regulations related to SPACs. 
In April, the SEC warned the market about accounting rule clarifications regarding SPACs, and NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said last month that SPACs can expect increased regulation and calls for transparency amid heightened scrutiny from the SEC.
The housing market has been booming with rising demand amid low interest rates. This has allowed OPEN to expand its market reach. The company now has a presence in more than 30 markets.

Not that prices are moving back up, it's a great time to consider precious metal stocks such as Centerra Gold (CGAU), Centamin (CELTF), and Jaguar Mining (OTC:JAGGF).Gold and other precious metals suffered quite the steep skid a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the decline was gold's steepest for a single week dating back to the spring of 2020. Thankfully, gold bounced right back after the disappointing week.
Most investors have some exposure to precious metals. However, plenty of investors have invested the entirety of their funds allotted to precious metals in gold. A better approach might be to invest in several different precious metals producers before a larger rebound occurs in the days and weeks ahead.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s first-half operating profit is expected to reach around 11 billion euros ($13 billion), it said on Friday, topping pre-pandemic levels on strong demand in Europe and the United States, particularly for Porsches and Audis.
The upmarket brands were less affected by an ongoing global shortage of crucial semiconductors, the German automaker said, adding its financial services arm also helped to boost earnings.
In the same period last year, Volkswagen posted an operating loss of 1.49 billion euros, hit by the coronavirus crisis, while it made a profit of around 9 billion in the first half of 2019.
Volkswagen's shares rose as much as 5.8% to the top of Germany's blue-chip DAX index.
Business in China, the world's largest car market, was slightly weaker in the period, Volkswagen said. Industry data earlier showed that auto sales in China fell 12.4% in June year-on-year, hit by the global chip bottleneck.
Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, said it now expected the main impact of the shortage, which has also hit rivals, to occur in the second half of the year.
The group said first-half reported automotive net cash flow was expected to reach around 10 billion euros, versus 5.57 billion in 2019 and a negative 4.8 billion last year.

Volkswagen, whose supervisory board is meeting to discuss a contract extension for Chief Executive Herbert Diess, is scheduled to publish full second-quarter results on July 29.

British supermarket groups have this month warned of gaps on shelves with demand for food and drink exceeding expectations during the month long soccer tournament, as families continue to eat more at home despite the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions on hospitality openings. 
With England playing Italy on Sunday evening in its first major soccer tournament final since 1966 and millions of people across the country planning weekend parties, barbecues and get togethers, supermarkets are braced for demand to go through the roof.
Asda, Britain's No.3 supermarket group, predicted it would sell over 45 million packs of beer and more than 1 million pizzas this weekend.
On Sunday alone it estimates it will sell 200,000 individual burgers, equivalent to 19 tonnes. 
Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest grocer, said this week that last Saturday (July 3), when England played Ukraine in their Euro 2020 quarter final, the group sold around 17 packs of beer a second, which was 60% higher than an average Saturday.
""We're working hard to make sure we can maintain availability but clearly there are challenges in the upward supply chain,"" he said, highlighting some issues in high demand product areas, such as beer, soft drinks and salad packs.
His finance chief Kevin O'Byrne added: ""You'll find products you want, you may not find every brand you want.""
Britain's government said on Wednesday it would relax rules this month for how long truck drivers can work, as a temporary fix for a severe shortage of qualified heavy goods vehicle (HGV) operators.

The pandemic, which prompted many foreign drivers to return home during lockdowns, and new immigration controls after Brexit have led to the shortage - estimated at over 100,000 by industry lobby group, the Road Haulage Association.
Premier Foods, one of Britain's biggest food companies, last week called on the government to consider using the army to distribute goods.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Friday added 14 Chinese companies and other entities to its economic blacklist over alleged human rights abuses and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang.
The Commerce Department said the companies had been ""implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass detention, and high technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.""
Beijing denies the alleged abuses.
Reuters first reported the planned additions late Thursday.
They include the China Academy of Electronics and Information Technology; Xinjiang Lianhai Chuangzhi Information Technology Co; Shenzhen Cobber Information Technology Co; Xinjiang Sailing Information Technology; Beijing Geling Shentong Information Technology; Shenzhen Hua'antai Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.; and Chengdu Xiwu Security System Alliance Co., Ltd.
The Commerce Department said in total it was adding 34 entities including some from Russia and Iran, and another five entities directly supporting China's military modernization programs related to lasers and battle management system.
“The Department of Commerce remains firmly committed to taking strong, decisive action to target entities that are enabling human rights abuses in Xinjiang or that use U.S. technology to fuel China’s destabilizing military modernization efforts,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. 
The list also includes eight entities for facilitating the export of U.S. items to Iran and six entities for involvement in the procurement of U.S.-origin electronic components, likely in furtherance of Russian military programs.
The action follows the department's decision last month to add five other companies and other Chinese entities to the blacklist over allegations of forced labor in the far western region of China.
China dismisses accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang and says its policies are necessary to stamp out separatists and religious extremists who plotted attacks and stirred up tension between mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs and Han, China's largest ethnic group.
""The Chinese side will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and rejects U.S. attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Friday.
The latest action shows President Joe Biden aims to press China over what the administration says are worsening human rights abuses against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang.
Generally, entities added to the economic blacklist are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department and face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.
This is not the first time the U.S. government has targeted Chinese firms linked to allegations of high-tech surveillance activity in Xinjiang.

In 2019, the Trump administration added some of China’s top artificial intelligence startups to its economic blacklist over its treatment of Muslim minorities.
The Commerce Department under Trump targeted 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd.

The deal will put London-headquartered Aon ahead of the world's largest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC) and comes as insurers struggle with rising claims and new challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.
The European Commission said the asset sales will make Arthur J. Gallagher a credible rival to the combined company.
""The commitments will strengthen Gallagher in its capabilities in reinsurance and commercial risk brokerage and improve its footprint in the European Economic Area,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.
Reuters had exclusively reported on April 28 that the Commission would give conditional approval to the deal. 
Aon and Willis cautioned in a joint statement that the deal sill faces other regulatory approvals, including in the United States, where the antitrust regulators sued last month to block the combination. 

But the companies said the EU approval ""demonstrates continued progress toward obtaining regulatory clearances.""
On June 16, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Aon's acquisition of Willis, saying it would reduce competition and could lead to higher prices.

A bigger dividend of 8 cents for the third quarter from the second quarter’s 6 cents and HSBC's (NYSE:HSBC) higher target of $34 for the stock, a 19% upside, were also contributing to the bump in the stock price.
The company now expects its adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year to come between $1.29 and $1.33. This is higher than the $1.12 EPS the company clocked for the year ended November 24, 2019, a pre-pandemic time.   
The company expects a sharp rebound in the business in the second half, given that compared to 2019, its two major markets, Europe and Asia, were still reporting revenue lower than the 2019 levels. Americas, its biggest market, was the exception as it grew from both 2020 and 2019 levels.  
The company swung to a profit in the three months ended May 30. Adjusted net income was $93 million compared to $192 million loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  
Revenue more than doubled to $1.27 billion from $498 million in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per share came at 23 cents.

Foxconn and electric car manufacturer Fisker Inc said in May that they had finalised a vehicle-assembly deal. They did not identify a location, but Fisker's CEO said Foxconn's Wisconsin site was a possibility.
In a statement, Foxconn said it had begun discussions with Wisconsin. 
""Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions,"" it added.
The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, gave no further details.
A Wisconsin Economic Development Corp spokesman said the agency does not comment on any potential talks until a contract is executed.
In April, Foxconn drastically scaled back a planned $10 billion factory in Wisconsin, confirming its retreat from a project that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world"" and was supposed to build cutting-edge flat-panel display screens.
A month earlier, Foxconn's chairman said it may make electric vehicles (EVs) at the Wisconsin site, though could decide on Mexico, and would make a decision this year.
Over the past year or so Foxconn has announced several deals on the production of EVs with automakers including Fisker, China's Byton and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, and Stellantis NV's Fiat Chrysler unit.

On Friday, Fisker said talks with Wisconsin economic development officials were normal in the process of evaluating potential plant sites. The carmaker said in May it had finalized plans for Foxconn to build vehicles for the electric car startup at a U.S. plant starting in 2023, and Wisconsin was one of four options.
Foxconn aims to provide components or services to 10% of the world's EVs by 2025 to 2027, posing a threat to established automakers by allowing technology companies a shortcut to competing in the vehicle market.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened higher on Friday supported by a return to normal conditions in an overbought bond market. 
Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds rose all along the yield curve, amid perceptions that this week's growth scare had been overdone. The prospect of big Treasury bond auctions next week also restored some balance to a market that had been dominated by Federal Reserve buying amid a general lack of liquidity in recent days.  The rise in yields supported financial stocks, which have cheapened this week despite the prospect of another strong set of results when earnings season kicks off next Tuesday. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 2.5%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock rose 2.7%.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 244 points, or 0.7%, at 34,666 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% but the Nasdaq Composite underperformed, against a backdrop of concern about a new and wide-ranging executive order from President Joe Biden claiming to champion the consumer against big business. 
Biden's latest executive order focuses on the need to promote competition. While Internet service provision and the planned return of 'Net Neutrality' garnered most of the headlines, the order also promised to make things tougher for airlines, drug stores and the makers of medical products. 
Yet there was no obvious pattern to the market's reaction, suggesting that many would like to see more detail before jumping to conclusions. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock rose 3.6% after a bullish note from Wedbush praising its electrification strategy and highlighting its huge valuation discount to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The report also pulled Ford Motor (NYSE:F) up by over 2% in sympathy, while sentiment towards legacy automakers was also underpinned by Germany's Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY)announcing 11 billion euros ($13 billion) in operating profit in the first half of the year. VW ADRs rose 5.1%.
The largely symbolic action by the Biden administration to expand the blacklist of Chinese companies didn't stop a broad rebound in Chinese ADRs after a week of more substantial bad news from their home country. Didi Global  (NYSE:DIDI) ADRs rose 7.4%, while JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs rose 1.9% and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 2.0%.
Reopening plays broadly corrected upwards after a torrid week in which growing reports about the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus have cast doubt on the world's ability to end the pandemic. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Financial Times in an interview that the spread of Covid-19 through the rest of the world had the potential to act as a headwind on U.S. growth, and said that ""premature"" declarations of victory over the virus were ""one of the gravest risks"" to the outlook right now. 
BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 2.7% and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 2.0% after the two companies said they will ask for emergency use authorization for a 'booster shot' of its vaccine, after an early study showed it bolstered patients' defenses against the disease. They'll also start work on an updated vaccine aimed at ensuring equally high degrees of protection against more recent Covid variants."

1147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Canadian Labor Market Bounces Back Strongly After Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s job market roared back to life faster than expected in June, reversing the bulk of employment losses from country-wide lockdowns earlier this year.
The economy added 230,700 positions last month, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus economists’ expectations for an increase of 175,000. The nation had lost 275,000 jobs in April and May as governments shut down parts of the economy to contain a third wave of Covid-19 cases.
The report shows companies are prepared to rehire workers as pandemic restrictions are lifted, though there was one bit of weakness in the report. All the gains were in part-time employment, with full-time jobs down for a third straight month.
Total hours worked were little changed. The unemployment rate fell to 7.8% from 8.2%; economists had predicted a jobless rate of 7.8%.
The Canadian dollar was little changed on the report, trading 0.4% higher at 9:02 a.m. in Toronto. One U.S. dollar buys C$1.2485.
One bit of good news is that the labor force jumped by 169,900, suggesting firms who want to hire will having greater success recruiting workers. The labor force participation rate rose to 65.2%, fully recovering from two months of declines.
“The rising participation rate should alleviate some concerns about widespread labor shortages,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors.
Part-Time Work
With the June gains, Canada has recovered 2.65 million of the 3 million jobs lost at the height of the pandemic last year.
The nation created 263,900 part-time jobs, with full-time employment down 33,200.
The bulk of the gains were in pandemic-exposed sectors, like retail, food and accommodation that got hit most by the new containment measures. Employment in accommodation and food services was up 101,000. The retail sector added 75,000 jobs.
Increasing vaccination rates and falling Covid-19 case counts have allowed the country to finally re-open restaurants, bars and retail stores after months of closures. Ontario began allowing patio dining earlier this month and several cities in Quebec have further relaxed restrictions, allowing indoor dining for the first time this year.
The jobs report is the last major piece of economic data before next week’s central bank policy decision, where it’s expected to continue paring back its stimulus efforts. The Bank of Canada is among the first from advanced economies to shift to a less expansionary policy, having already cut its purchases of Canadian government bonds to C$3 billion ($2.4 billion) weekly from a peak of C$5 billion last year.
Analysts anticipate that will come down to C$2 billion per week at the July 14 meeting, before eventually falling to a weekly pace of about C$1 billion by early next year. In addition to the bond tapering, the market has priced in at least one interest rate hike by this time next year.
With vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing, economists are predicting a strong rebound in the second half. Canada’s expansion is seen accelerating to an annualized pace of 9.1% in the third quarter, with a 6% gain in the final three months of 2021, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists earlier this month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Pfizer and partner BioNTech plan to ask U.S. and European regulators within weeks to authorize a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, based on evidence of greater risk of infection six months after inoculation and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, however, in a joint statement that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster COVID-19 shot at this time.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was too early to determine whether more than the two shots that are currently required would be called for, saying it was confident for now that the established regimen was sufficient.
Some scientists have also questioned the need for booster shots. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, said the recently reported dip in the vaccine's effectiveness in Israel was mostly due to infections in people who had been vaccinated in January or February. The country's health ministry said vaccine effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease fell to 64% in June.
""The Pfizer vaccine is highly active against the Delta variant,"" Dolsten said in an interview. But after six months, he said, ""there likely is the risk of reinfection as antibodies, as predicted, wane."" Data would be submitted to the FDA within the next month, he added.
Pfizer did not release the full set of Israeli data on Thursday, but said it would be published soon.
""It's a small data set, but I think the trend is accurate: Six months out, given that Delta is the most contagious variant we have seen, it can cause infections and mild disease,"" Dolsten said. 
The FDA and CDC, in their joint statement, said: ""We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.""
Pfizer's own data from the United States showed an erosion of the vaccine's efficacy to the mid-80s after six months, Dolsten said, against the variants circulating there in the spring.
He stressed that data from Israel and Britain suggests that even with waning antibody levels, the vaccine remains around 95% effective against severe disease. 
The vaccine, initially devised by Germany's BioNTech, showed 95% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in a clinical trial the companies ran last year. 
PROMISING PROTECTION
Dolsten said early data from the company's own studies shows that a third booster dose generates antibody levels that are five-to-10-fold higher than after the second dose, suggesting that a third dose will offer promising protection.
He said multiple countries in Europe and elsewhere have already approached Pfizer to discuss booster doses, and some may begin administering them before a potential U.S. authorization.
Dolsten said he believes booster shots are particularly important in older age groups.
Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said basing the decision on waning antibody protection ignores the role of important other parts of the immune response, including memory B cells, which can make antibodies on demand when challenged by the virus.
""You need better studies to be able to assert that. It isn't just neutralizing antibodies,"" Topol said.
European watchdog EMA stressed that available vaccines appeared to work well provided that the two-shot course, required for all but Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s product, is completed.
""It seems that the four vaccines authorised in the EU protect against all the strains that are circulating in the EU including the delta variant,"" it said in a statement.
Pfizer has previously said people will likely need a booster dose, though some scientists have questioned when, or whether, boosters will be needed.
BioNTech has previously argued that while antibodies are the body's main weapon against an initial infection, the cellular immune response mainly shields against the disease breaking out and worsening.
Pfizer plans to launch soon a placebo-controlled efficacy trial of the booster with 10,000 participants. The study will run throughout the fall, Dolsten said, meaning it will not be completed ahead of the company's filing with the FDA. 
European governments have braced for the possibility of repeat shots. Britain in April moved to buy 60 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine ahead of a possible booster programme later this year, bringing its total order to 100 million doses.
The EU in May signed a new contract to receive 1.8 billion doses of the vaccine for 2021-2023, to cover booster shots and donations.
Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said even if Pfizer succeeds in getting its booster authorized by the FDA, it would still need to be recommended by advisers to the CDC.
Schaffner added that most of the public health bandwidth in the United States is still focused on encouraging Americans to get their first and second doses of the vaccine.
Because boosters would drive increasing demand for vaccines while much of the world is still unvaccinated, Dolsten said Pfizer is looking at ways to increase production.
It is already targeting production of 3 billion doses this year and 4 billion shots next year. Dolsten declined to give a forecast of exactly how many more doses the company could add.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they had designed a new version of the vaccine targeting the Delta variant with a clinical trial likely to begin in August, but added the current vaccine version had ""the potential"" to protect against the variant.

Pfizer expects the COVID-19 vaccine to be a major revenue contributor for years and has forecast sales of $26 billion from the shot in 2021. BioNTech said in May that vaccine supply deals for this year so far are worth 12.4 billion euros in revenues that accrue to it, with more contracts on the cards. 
Global spending on COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots could total $157 billion through 2025, according to U.S. health data firm IQVIA Holdings (NYSE:IQV).

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Sun International has agreed easier borrowing terms with its lenders, two sources told Reuters, giving South Africa's biggest casino firm a year of financial breathing space as a third wave of COVID-19 crashes over the tourism industry. 
The deal with Standard Bank, Absa Group and Nedbank essentially helps Sun stave off any prospect of default, said one of the sources, who was directly involved in the deal. 
It is also a sign banks will continue to support the stricken hospitality industry more generally, said the second source, from one of Sun's leaders.
Sun had 7.67 billion rand ($538 million) of debt as of March 31.
""Absa and the other lenders remain supportive of Sun International and the measures taken by management,"" Absa said in an emailed response to questions, without giving details. 
Standard Bank and Nedbank declined to comment. 
Sun said it would announce any new information with its interim results in September.
South Africa is the continent's worst-affected nation in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths, accounting for more than a third of confirmed infections and over 40% of fatalities. Only 6% of the country has received one or more doses of a vaccine.
The government has tightened restrictions recently as cases have picked up again, forcing most hotels and casinos to close temporarily. 
The sources said the new deal covered terms of payment, known as covenants, but declined to give the precise details. 
A covenant is usually a measure of debt-to-core earnings (EBITDA) and is closely monitored by banks as part of loan repayment terms.
""A new covenant has been agreed to, which is obviously higher. And it is likely for a 12-month period and will be measured quarterly,"" said the source directly involved in the deal, adding it was signed at the end of June.
A higher ratio would allow Sun to have more debt or lower operating profit, or both.

Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio manager at the investment arm of banking group FNB, said covenant waivers were ""hugely"" important for the hospitality sector. 
""Banks know that the hospitality industry needs to stay afloat till the end of this year or early next year and after that South African consumer expenditure numbers show that there will be actually be a boom,"" he said.

By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) -Kerry Kraker, 56, has worked in kitchens all his life. Since March he's spent around $100 a week - half his spare cash – on silver coins. He's part of a growing social media movement who say they are buying bars and coins for protection from a coming age of inflation.
Thanks to a community of like-minded silver 'stackers' gathering on social-media platform Reddit Inc., Seattle-based Kraker says he also feels empowered.
""They are so encouraging and so convinced in the changes they can cause,"" Kraker, who lost his home in the financial crisis, told Reuters.
Inspired by Reddit forum WallStreetBets, some of the 122,000-strong community hope to corner the market and bring down what they say is an unjust banking system.
Market professionals say that is unlikely to succeed - there is plenty of silver, and central bankers in the United States and Europe expect inflation to stay in low single-digits.
But bankers aren't getting through to this group.
""There's a bit of anger, like 'fuck the system.' If there's a back door to wealth, I might take that door because the front door is closed,"" said Kraker. ""The bankers and others have basically shut that door for everyone who is not themselves.""
The core of the movement is a Reddit community called Wall Street Silver, formed in January at the time WallStreetBets was marshalling an uprising of ordinary people against the financial elites, through coordinated buying of company shares.
Reuters spoke to more than 20 members, who call themselves ""silverbacks"" and ""apes,"" have a home page featuring an image of an army of primates on the march from the ""Planet of the Apes"" movie, and say things like ""Ape like shiny."" They organise ""raids"" – days on which everyone buys together.
The group's founder, Ivan Bayoukhi, is a 24-year old former car salesman living with his parents in Alberta, Canada. ""NOW IS THE TIME TO WAKE UP AND TAKE THE POWER BACK IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE,"" says https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/mlpxev/now_is_the_time_to_wake_up_and_take_the_power one of his characteristic posts.
Silver costs around $26 an ounce. Stackers think the price will rise as inflation erodes the value of currencies, demand for silver rises, and supplies run short. Some say that by buying up bars and coins, they can jack up prices by 100% or even 1,000%, to the point where they can call the shots against the so-called bullion banks, the large financial institutions which lead trade in precious metals.
A March post Our time draws nigh...keep stacking and we will win the day! : Wallstreetsilver pictured silver coins laid out to spell a message to the head of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), a U.S. investment bank which dominates the bullion trade: ""KISS MY ASS JAMIE DIMON."" JPMorgan declined to comment.
""In a year or two we will have millions of people in the movement,"" Bayoukhi told Reuters. ""And then it will be over for the bullion banks.""
""CORNER THE MARKET""
Prices of silver and gold, which are traditionally seen as safe stores of wealth, have risen since 2019: Gold is up around 40% and silver around 70% since then. The silver stackers are joining millions worldwide who believe currencies are vulnerable – a fear that has grown as governments borrowed and printed money in the pandemic.
""It scares me every day when this bomb will burst,"" said Tim Hack, a 23-year-old stacker in Germany. ""Silver and gold really have intrinsic physical value that you can even feel when you hold it in your hand.""
Posters on Reddit joined the silver fray on Jan. 27, when posts appeared on WallStreetBets saying that if enough people bought the metal, they could push prices to the moon.
""Corner the market,"" said one.
Adding to the impetus was an argument put forward on Reddit that big banks trade huge quantities of paper contracts for silver that they don't have in their possession, keeping prices lower than they should be.
In some ways, that's correct.
Contracts representing around 800 million ounces of silver are active in the New York futures market alone - more than twice the amount the exchange says is in its registered vaults, not all of which is available for delivery. Much of the silver that banks buy and sell in London, another big trading hub, is borrowed, bankers and traders say. 
If every professional who owns silver on paper called in their dues at once, there wouldn't be enough metal on hand, they agree. The system works because most people with contracts don't want actual metal, which they'd have to pay to store and insure. They are speculators, or miners and jewellers, hedging their risks.
After the posts on WallStreetBets, around $3 billion rushed into a fund run by asset managers Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) that stores silver for investors. Blackrock said it added more than 100 million (adds dropped word) ounces of silver to its stockpile in three days. Silver's wholesale price jumped nearly 20%.
Much of the silver stored for Blackrock is in London. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), an industry body, later said that there had been ""concerns that London would run out of silver.""
Blackrock told Reuters it did not track where the money had come from.
The Reddit group's founder Bayoukhi said he watched with growing excitement, turned to his father and said, ""Why don't I start a Wall Street silver community?""
""FAMILY FOREVER""
There's also truth in Redditors' claims that big players can influence the silver market. One trader tactic is spoofing - sending out fake buy or sell orders to shift prices before completing the real trade. 
In 2020, JPMorgan paid $920 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that its staff sent ""hundreds of thousands"" of fake orders into precious metals and Treasury markets. The bank said at the time that the people responsible had left and it had improved its compliance systems. It declined further comment for this story.
But the impact of spoofing lasts only seconds or minutes, said Ross Norman, a London-based former precious metals trader.
The January squeeze lasted three days. Then WallStreetBets returned its focus to stock markets; silver calmed. Since early February, the price of silver has fallen by a dollar.
Undeterred, Wall Street Silver issues a deluge of tips, analysis, memes, photos and encouragement. It is only Reddit's 3,783rd biggest community, but it is frequently in the top 20 for volume of posts per day.
When a new member posts, Bayoukhi often responds https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/o92fmi/silver_is_a_national_security_commodity_covertly saying, ""You are now family forever.""
""HELL OF A TIME""
Reddit buyers sit at the end of a fat silver pipeline. Only about a quarter of the 1 billion ounces or so that are produced each year is used to manufacture the bars and coins that most of them are buying, analysts say. Most of the rest is used for jewellery and in industrial applications.
Michael Mesaric, who runs the world's largest gold and silver refiner - Valcambi SA, in Switzerland - says the 1,000 ounce bars of silver used in the wholesale market are plentiful: For small investors to think they can corner the market is ""entirely wrong.""
""They can engineer a squeeze on products,"" he said. ""But silver in total? They'll have a hell of a time.""
Investors will stockpile a lot of silver this year, but less than in 2020, according to consultants Metals Focus. Demand in the West is strong, but in India, one of the biggest silver consuming countries, the pandemic is reducing people's ability to buy, they say. 
Funds like Blackrock's stockpiled 331 million ounces - the most ever - in 2020, Metals Focus said in a report for the Silver Institute; bar and coin buyers took home 200 million ounces more. This year, the consultancy expects funds to hoard 150 million ounces - the second highest level ever - and bar and coin buyers 253 million ounces.
Silver coins and bars can certainly hold their value. Higher inflation should lift prices, as will rising demand from makers of goods like electronics and solar panels, said Rhona O'Connell, an analyst at traders and brokers StoneX.
But she, and others at companies that trade the metal, think predictions of $1,000 an ounce are out of this world.

Of 39 analysts and traders polled by Reuters in April, only seven thought silver prices would average $30 or more in 2022. The highest average that they forecast was $44. 
Redditors are unmoved. Kraker, the restaurant worker, has begun reading obsessively about inflation, money supply and other economic data. ""There is a monster around the corner,"" he said. ""I'm trying to sharpen my stick.""

1153,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 08:18AM ET</span>",Value Trade Is Just Getting Started Beyond the U.S. Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- As Wall Street ponders the longevity of the value trade after a miserable few weeks of performance in the U.S., outside of the country it could be just getting started.
For all the dominance of megacap growth names, American stocks led the world during the cyclical upswing in the first half of the year -- and that means other regions are now primed for a catch-up.
Take Europe. With a far more economically sensitive equity market, a vaccine roll-out finally closing the gap to the U.S. and business activity gathering speed, firms from Lombard Odier to BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). are recommending investors boost their exposure to the region.
“The post-pandemic growth relay has shifted,” Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, wrote in a note. “From China to the U.S. and now to the euro zone.”
With global stocks stabilizing on Friday following a slump, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1% compared with 0.5% for S&P 500 futures.
That’s a contrast to the year so far. The U.S. benchmark gained 15% in 2021 through Thursday, while its European peer climbed about 13%. At the same time, a U.S. index of value shares outpaced a rest-of-world gauge by more than 6 percentage points, according to MSCI Inc. indexes.
It all means European shares look cheap. Members of the Stoxx 600 trade at less than 17-times expected earnings versus 21-times for stocks in the S&P 500. In the U.K. it’s even more dramatic -- FTSE 100 Index companies trade at an average of 13-times the coming year’s earnings.
“Euro zone and U.K. equities still trade at relatively cheap multiples, despite their exposures to both the global recovery and the reflation themes,” Stephane Monier, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier, wrote in a note. “These are where we see the greatest likely benefits from economic re-openings, an acceleration in relative earnings momentum as well as attractive valuations.”
And while European equity funds drew $16 billion last quarter, the strongest flows in four years, they stand to gain even more given $230 billion of outflows over the last three years, Sanford C. Bernstein strategists pointed out in a Friday note.
It helps that the region’s economic growth is also likely to accelerate -- European Union officials markedly raised their outlook for the euro-area economy this week.
“We see a sizeable pickup in activity helped by accelerating vaccinations,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists wrote in their mid-year outlook this week, as they shifted to overweight on European shares and to neutral on U.S. equities. “Valuations remain attractive relative to history and investor inflows into the region are only just starting to pick up.”
Of course, the bull case depends on a conviction that economic momentum is only poised to accelerate. There remain fears that new Covid variants can set back the global recovery, which in any case may be constrained by labor shortages and supply bottlenecks -- both legacies of the pandemic.
Concerns about growth momentum are part of what has stalled the reflation trade in the U.S.
Treasury yields sunk to a four-month low this week, and a long-short value strategy is down again in July after sliding the most since January 2020 last month. Giant growth shares like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). -- the kind Europe doesn’t have -- have been back in the ascendancy.
At  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., strategists say it might be too soon to worry.
“Strong EPS momentum should provide further support for global equities in 2H21, but monetary tightening will loom larger into 2022,” strategists including Robert Buckland and Beata Manthey wrote in a note. “The U.K. remains our favorite value trade.”

The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) late on Wednesday announced it had signed a ""headquarters agreement"" with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to open its ""regional office in the kingdom"".
IATA, which represents some 290 airlines around the world, currently has its regional office in Jordan's capital Amman.
IATA said the body had agreed to set up an office in Saudi Arabia but not a regional headquarters.
""It will serve the growing needs of the industry in (Saudi Arabia). We have a regional headquarters ... in Amman and we are not moving its functions to (Saudi Arabia),"" an IATA spokesperson said by email.
GACA did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
Saudi Arabia is putting pressure on companies to move their regional offices to the kingdom, warning that from 2024 it would not award state contracts to those with regional headquarters elsewhere.
The move is one of many recent economic and social reforms in an effort to diversify the economy away from its oil dependence.
    Saudi Arabia last week announced a transportation and logistics drive aimed at making the kingdom the fifth-biggest air transit hub.
People familiar with the matter said a planned new airline would target international transit passenger traffic, going head-to-head with Gulf giants Emirates and Qatar Airways and opening up a new front in regional competition.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>","Airport, airlines start legal action against Britain over travel rules","LONDON (Reuters) - A group of airports and airlines launched legal action against the British government over its travel curbs on Friday, challenging ministers to be more transparent over decisions on rating COVID-19 risks in destination countries. 
The litigation, led by Manchester Airports Group, with backing from Ryanair, easyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and TUI UK, is going ahead despite plans announced by the government on Thursday to allow more travel.
""British consumers need to understand how decisions are made so they can confidently plan their travel, which is why we are asking the government to provide the data and advice that is underpinning its decision making,"" the chief executives of the five companies involved said in a statement. 
Britain said fully-vaccinated British residents returning from medium-risk countries will no longer have to quarantine on arrival home from July 19, opening up travel for the 65% of adults who have had two jabs and those aged under 18. 
But travel companies say it is still not clear how the government makes decisions about rating destinations under its traffic light system where low risk is green, medium risk is amber and high risk is red. 
Despite the coming rule change, the complainants want the legal action to force a wider re-opening of travel. 
There are just a handful of green destinations, many of them smaller islands. All the big destinations like mainland Spain, Greece, France and the United States are amber.
That means that even after July 19, travel will remain restricted and demand dampened, because those who have not had two vaccine doses, as well as non-UK residents wanting to come to Britain will face quarantine. 
Sixteen months of travel restrictions have put all airlines and airports under severe financial strain, and they say a fuller re-opening is required to help their recovery and sustain millions of jobs. 

Their case against the transport minister Grant Shapps was heard at London's High Court on Friday. 
The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system cautiously managed the risk of new variants, adding: ""We cannot comment on legal proceedings.""

Investing.com – General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock was 3% higher in Friday’s premarket trading on a bullish call by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.
The analyst sees the stock at $85, an upside of almost 52% from its closing of $56.06 on Thursday.
Ives said he believes 2021 to be an inflection point for the legacy automaker as it pivots to electric vehicles. His bullish estimates don’t rule out the company’s market cap doubling by the end of 2022.
GM has lined up at least 20 new electric vehicle launches in two years.
“The laser focus on electric vehicles has given new energy and strategic focus to GM which the Street has clearly started to take notice,” Ives wrote in his note.
GM plans to sell more than 1 million electric vehicles every year by 2025. The new spending is a 26% increase from plans announced late last year. 
GM expects its first-half adjusted EBIT between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion due to continued strong demand, better-than-expected results at GM Financial, and an improved near-term production outlook."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely higher Friday, attempting to rebound from the previous session’s losses although weakness in Big Tech could weigh following a report that the Biden administration is to look to reinstate Obama-era rules on net neutrality.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 220 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures was marginally lower.
The broad-based S&P 500 closed Thursday 0.9% lower, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 250 points, or 0.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7%. 
Axios, an American news website, reported Friday that President Joe Biden will push the Federal Communications Commission to reinstate rules on 'Net Neutrality' that had been scrapped by President Donald Trump. This would form part of an initiative aimed at enhancing competition in many sectors across the economy. Trump's reforms had been welcomed at the time by both content providers and broadband operators.
This comes as concerns grow about the impact of the Covid-19 virus, and particularly the delta strain, on global economic growth. For example, May GDP grew 0.8% in the U.K. on the month, a sharp slowdown from the 2.0% gain the previous month, which in itself was revised lower. 
San Francisco President Mary Daly warned on Friday in an interview with the Financial Times of the danger of assuming the pandemic was over, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated earlier this week that the delta variant was now the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States.
There was some good news on the subject, as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), along with partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), announced late Thursday that they plan to apply shortly for emergency use authorization for a booster shot to their Covid-19 vaccine, while also starting work on an updated version of their virus to tackle new variants.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher, boosted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration reporting Thursday a drop in the country's crude inventories of just under 7 million barrels. The official body also stated that fuel demand soared to 10 million barrels a day in the week before the July 4 national holiday.
Also of note Friday will be the release of the Baker Hughes total of working U.S. oil rigs as well as the CFTC crude oil net speculative positions. 
At 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $73.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $74.73.
Additionally, gold futures was flat at $1,800.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1862.

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's biggest IPO in more than a decade, the billion dollar offering from e-commerce firm Bukalapak, received enough investor orders to cover the sale on its launch day on Friday, two sources said, reflecting strong appetite for tech stocks.
The listing comes at a time when the pandemic has boosted demand in Indonesia's $40 billion e-commerce market. Bukalapak has sought to focus on smaller clients as it competes with bigger rivals Tokopedia, Sea Ltd's Shopee and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Lazada.
Two sources familiar with the deal said a spate of orders from large investors meant the books for Bukalapak's IPO were covered across its indicative price range.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Until a few months ago, Bukalapak, the No.4 e-commerce company, was looking to raise just $300 million. That grew to $800 million and this week it expanded the offer again, by 25%, as investors clamoured for a piece of the company.
""As the first tech unicorn to launch an IPO in Indonesia, the hype, especially from retail investors, is quite high"", said Rudiyanto, a director at Panin Asset Management in Jakarta. A unicorn is a private startup firm that achieves a $1 billion valuation.
Bukalapak, whose name means 'opening a kiosk' in Indonesian, is aiming to raise up to $1.13 billion by selling as much as 25% of its enlarged capital. It is marketing the shares between 750 and 850 rupiah apiece.
It is seeking a valuation of up to $5.6 billion, double the level two years ago, and is backed by Singapore sovereign investor GIC, Ant Financial, local media conglomerate Emtek and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The books for the IPO are open until July 19, when the share price will be set. The company is set to make its market debut on Aug. 6.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and UBS are the joint global coordinators and bookrunners with Mandiri.
""Our business is focused on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. They are the prime movers in the Indonesian economy,"" Bukalapak CEO Rachmat Kaimuddin told an online briefing for investors.
""The opportunity to digitalise them and cater to underserved markets, especially outside the big cities, is very promising.""
Around 30% of Indonesia's e-commerce transactions were estimated to have occurred in second-tier cities last year, but that share is seen rising to 48% by 2025, he added.
Over 60% of the IPO proceeds will be used to invest in the business, which had revenue of $95.8 million in 2020 and more than 100 million users. The rest will be used to expand Bukalapak subsidiaries.
With a population of 270 million, Indonesia has one of the world's fastest-growing online shopping sectors and is home to many startups.
GoTo, the merged entity of Tokopedia and ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, is also planning an IPO. Sources have said GoTo is looking to raise at least $2 billion in pre-IPO funding in the next few months, which will be followed by a local listing.

""This will also be like testing the water for the upcoming IPO of GoTo,"" said Rudiyanto of Bukalapak's IPO.
    Bukalapak and GoTo's debuts will turbocharge Indonesia's long lacklustre IPO market, which stagnated further during the pandemic. Money raised via IPOs more than halved in 2020 to $470 million, according to Refinitiv data.

The companies had earlier conducted a study whose results suggested that patients' defenses against the virus were significantly enhanced by a third shot of the vaccine.
BioNTech was up nearly 10% and Pfizer 0.5%. 
Alongside, the companies are also working on an updated version of the vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant, BioNtech said.  
The booster will be in addition to the two shots currently being given at three-to-four-month interval. BioNTech said the third dose may be needed within 6 to 12 months after full vaccination.
New variants of the disease are forcing drug companies to update the original versions of their vaccines to ensure that they continue to offer the same high degree of protection. 
The first vaccines were built on the virus that originated in China in 2019. Since then, it has mutated several times with the Delta variant, first identified in India, being the most highly-transmissible variant yet.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 05:32AM ET</span>",How Vietnam's 'influencer' army wages information warfare on Facebook,"By James Pearson
HANOI (Reuters) - In Vietnam, where the state is fighting a fierce online battle against political dissent, social media ""influencers"" are more likely to be soldiers than celebrities.
Force 47, as the Vietnamese army's online information warfare unit is known, consists of thousands of soldiers who, in addition to their normal duties, are tasked with setting up, moderating and posting on pro-state Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) groups, to correct ""wrong views"" online.
According to a Reuters review of provincial-level state media reports and broadcasts by the army's official television station, Force 47 has since its inception in 2016 set up hundreds of Facebook groups and pages, and published thousands of pro-government articles and posts.
Social media researchers say the group may be the largest and most sophisticated influence network in Southeast Asia. And it is now playing a prominent role in the country's intensifying conflict with Facebook.
After being approached by Reuters this week, a Facebook source said the company had removed a group called ""E47"", which had mobilised both military and non-military members to report posts they did not like to Facebook in an effort to have them taken down. The source said the group was connected to a list of Force 47 groups identified by Reuters. 
A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that some groups and accounts were taken down on Thursday for ""coordinating attempts to mass report content."" A company source said the action was one of Facebook's largest takedowns initiated under its mass reporting policy.
But many of the Force 47 accounts and groups identified by Reuters remain active. Since they are operated by users under their real names, they do not violate Facebook policies, the company source said.
Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles enquiries to the government from foreign media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the takedown.
Unlike in neighbouring China, Facebook is not blocked in Vietnam, where it has 60 million to 70 million users. It is Vietnam's main platform for e-commerce and generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for the company.
It has also become the main platform for political dissent, launching Facebook and the government into a constant tussle over the removal of content deemed to be ""anti-state"".
Vietnam has undergone sweeping economic reforms and social change in recent decades, but the ruling Communist Party retains a tight grip over media and tolerates little dissent.
Last year, Vietnam slowed traffic on Facebook's local servers to a crawl until it agreed to significantly increase the censorship of political content in Vietnam. Months later, authorities threatened to shut down Facebook in Vietnam entirely if it did not locally restrict access to more content.
In a statement to Reuters, a Facebook spokesperson said the company's goal was to keep its services in Vietnam online ""for as many people as possible to express themselves, connect with friends and run their business"".
""We've been open and transparent about our decisions in response to the rapid rise in attempts to block our services in Vietnam,"" the spokesperson said.
Vietnam does not have the wherewithal to sustain a Chinese-style ""Great Firewall"" and develop local social media alternatives, said Dien Luong, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.
""This has paved the way for Facebook to become the platform of choice for Force 47 to safeguard the party line, shape public opinion and spread state propaganda.""
'SKILLED AND MALICIOUS'
There is no official definition of what constitutes a ""wrong view"" in Vietnam. But activists, journalists, bloggers and - increasingly - Facebook users, have all received hefty jail terms in recent years for spreading ""anti-state propaganda"", or opinions which counter those promoted by the Party.
Last week, Le Van Dung, a prominent activist who regularly broadcasts live to thousands of followers on Facebook, was arrested after more than a month on the run, according to a police statement.
Dung, who goes by ""Le Dung Vova"" was detained on charges of ""making, storing, spreading information, materials and items for the purpose of opposing the state"", under Article 117 of Vietnam's Penal Code. 
He faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.
Force 47 takes its name from Directive 47, a policy document issued by the army's General Political Department on Jan. 8, 2016. Analysts say it was created as an alternative to hiring civilian ""opinion shapers"" - or ""du luan vien"" - that had operated on a smaller, less successful scale.
""Since the 'du luan vien' were not as well trained in Party ideology or as conservative as military officials, their performance was not as good as expected,"" said Nguyen The Phuong, a researcher at the Saigon Center for International Studies. ""Force 47 is also less costly. Military officials consider it part of their job and don't ask for an allowance.""
The size of Force 47 is not clear, but in 2017, the general in charge of the unit at the time, Nguyen Trong Nghia, said it had 10,000 ""red and competent"" members. The true number could be much higher: the Reuters review of known Force 47 Facebook groups showed tens of thousands of users.
The Facebook source said the E47 group it had taken action against was made up of an active membership of military and non-military members.
Nghia now heads the main propaganda arm of the Party. Vietnam's information ministry recently promulgated a social media code of conduct that closely resembles Force 47 directives, urging people to post about ""good deeds"" and banning anything that affects ""the interests of the state.""
'STRUGGLE ON THE INTERNET'
In March, conferences were held at military bases across Vietnam to mark five years since the creation of Force 47.
State media reports about the meetings named at least 15 Facebook pages and groups it said were controlled by Force 47 which collectively had over 300,000 followers, according to a Reuters analysis of those groups.
Rather than being a single army unit, Force 47 soldiers appear to carry out their activities alongside their usual duties and create locally targeted content, the reports revealed.
In addition to Facebook, Force 47 creates anonymous Gmail and Yahoo email addresses, and accounts on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and Twitter, according to the reports. 
YouTube said it had terminated nine channels on Friday for violating its policies on spam, including a channel identified by Reuters as a suspected Force 47 operation.
Twitter said it had not seen any activity by Force 47.
Many of the Facebook groups reviewed by Reuters played on patriotic sentiments with names such as ""I love the Socialist Republic of Vietnam"", ""Vietnam in my Heart"", ""Voice of the Fatherland"" and ""Believe in the Party"".
Some groups, such as ""Keeping company with Force 47"" and ""Roses of Force 47"" were obvious in their affiliation, while others - such as ""Pink Lotus"" and a few groups that used the names of local towns in their titles - were more subtle. 
The posts varied in content, with many extolling Vietnam's army, founding leader Ho Chi Minh, or Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong. Others showed screenshots of ""wrong information"" posted by other Facebook users, marked with a large red ""X"".

""These developments unfolding in Vietnam are scary and have expanded with impunity,"" said Dhevy Sivaprakasam, Asia-Pacific policy counsel at internet rights group Access Now.
""We are witnessing the creation of a reality where people are not safe to speak freely online, and where there's no concept of individual privacy.""

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: White House to target bank mergers, financial data with competition order","By Nandita Bose and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's planned executive order to promote greater U.S. competition will target bank mergers by pushing the Federal Reserve and the Department of Justice to update merger guidelines and increase scrutiny of deals, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
It will also ask the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules giving consumers full control of their financial data to make it easier for customers to switch banks, the source said. 
The planned order, which is expected to be signed by Biden on Friday, is likely to chill M&A in the banking sector after a rash of deals unleashed by the Trump administration's more industry-friendly regulatory policy. 
Those included the $28 billion marriage of BB&T Corp (NYSE:TFC) and SunTrust, the biggest bank tie-up since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB)'s $4.7 billion purchase of MB Financial Inc, and many smaller deals. The value of M&A among commercial, savings and investment banks reached $54.66 billion by November 2020, the highest since 2009, according to data from Dealogic. 
While such transactions have been subject to federal review, government agencies have not formally denied a bank merger application in more than 15 years, according to a paper by Jeremy Kress, a University of Michigan professor who previously worked on bank merger oversight at the Fed. 
""There has been a rash of bank closures across the United States, and we're dealing with the bad effects for a lot of people and it's also hard to switch options ... so it is, in a sense, a crisis of competition,"" said the source. 
A report by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that the number of commercial banks in the U.S. has fallen by about 10,000 over the past two decades, a decline of 70%.
This has led to higher fees for consumers, reduced access to banking services for communities of color and low-income working families, and increased concerns about risk to the financial system, according to studies by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. 
Bank mergers have been a target of progressives including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who says consolidation harms consumers. 
The executive order, which would also address merger guidelines of two other federal agencies that oversee banks, could drag big banks into a high-stakes antitrust debate even as they warn they need help from Washington to compete with financial technology upstarts. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents the nation's biggest lenders, argued in 2020 that banks face a barrage of competition from such players. 
Reuters first reported Biden's plan to issue a competition executive order. Details have since emerged on specific actions the administration plans to take that will impact industries such as farm equipment manufacturers, rail and sea shipping, and the labor market. 
The actions are part of Biden's moves to strengthen competition by not just enforcing antitrust laws but using federal power to ignite competition in an array of businesses. 
Since taking office, he has appointed advocates of tougher antitrust enforcement to top roles at the White House and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission. 
Former President Barack Obama's administration issued a similar order in 2016, but it failed to yield results. The Biden order includes details on how government agencies should review deals and competition in industries, the source said. 
Biden's order also pushes to allow customers to switch banks by taking their financial transaction history data with them. 
In October, the CFPB sought comment on a potential proposal to increase consumers' access to their own financial data, which is collected by a growing number of financial institutions and apps. The agency's new leadership has yet to move ahead with it. 

The source said the White House hopes the executive order would spur the agency to push ahead with the changes. 
The increased ability to share such data could also help drive more accurate credit scoring models, helping to boost access to credit for under-served and minority communities, the source added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is set as early as Friday to add more than 10 Chinese companies to its economic blacklist over alleged human rights abuses and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang, two sources told Reuters.
The U.S. Commerce Department action will follow its announcement last month adding five other companies and other Chinese entities to the blacklist over allegations of forced labor in the far western region of China.
The additions to Commerce Department's Entity List are part of the Biden administration's efforts to hold China accountable for human rights violations, the sources said.
China dismisses accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang and says its policies are necessary to stamp out separatists and religious extremists who plotted attacks and stirred up tension between mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs and Han, China's largest ethnic group.
""The Chinese side will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and rejects U.S. attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Friday.
One of the sources for the economic blacklist additions said the Commerce Department plans to add 14 Chinese companies to the Entity List over reported abuses in Xinjiang.
The identity of the companies being added was not immediately known. Some companies from other countries will also be added to the department's blacklist as soon as Friday.
The White House declined to comment, while the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
RIGHTS ABUSES
The latest action shows President Joe Biden aims to press China over what the administration says are worsening human rights abuses against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang.
Generally, entity-listed companies are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department and face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.
Last month, the Commerce Department said it was adding the five Chinese entities ""for accepting or utilizing forced labor in the implementation of the People’s Republic of China’s campaign of repression against Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.""
The department said the action in June targeted the ability of the five entities, including Chinese-based solar panel material firm Hoshine Silicon Industry Co, ""to access commodities, software, and technology ... and is part of a U.S. Government-wide effort to take strong action against China’s ongoing campaign of repression against Muslim minority groups"" in Xinjiang.
This is not the first time the U.S. government has targeted Chinese firms linked to allegations of high-tech surveillance activity in Xinjiang.
In 2019, the Trump administration added some of China’s top artificial intelligence startups to its economic blacklist over its treatment of Muslim minorities.
The Commerce Department under Trump targeted 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd.

The Commerce Department said in 2019 the entities were implicated in ""high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.”

Ola did not give details on its IPO plans, but said that it continues to scale up its business across various categories and geographies.
""Over the last 12 months we have made our ride hailing business more robust, resilient and efficient. With strong recovery post lockdown and a shift in consumer preference away from public transportation,"" Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer Bhavish Aggarwal said in a statement.

U.S. President Joe Biden signed the order on June 3 that bans U.S. entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defence or surveillance technology sectors, replacing an earlier order under Donald Trump.
In a statement on its website, FTSE Russell said the additional Chinese companies will be deleted from its indexes on July 28. 
""Excluding quality Chinese companies from the indices will only hurt the image of and cause losses to the indices themselves,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
The United States is unjustifiably oppressing Chinese companies, he told a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday.
The decision was based on the feedback from index users and stakeholders, it said. 
Stocks to be removed include aerospace-related companies such as Aerospace CH UAV, Avic Aircraft, Avic Aviation High-Technology and Avic Heavy Machinery.
It also listed China Shipbuilding Industry, CSSC Offshore & Marine Engineering (Group), Inner Mongolia First Machinery Group.

The stocks will be removed from FTSE GEIS, the FTSE Global China A Inclusion indices and associated indices.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cash-rich Singapore Airlines positioned for regional dominance as rivals pull back,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd (SIA), flush with $16 billion raised since the start of the pandemic thanks to help from a state investor, is in a position of dominance among its Southeast Asian rivals as they downsize and restructure.
The crisis threatened the survival of hub carriers that lack domestic markets such as SIA, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd and Dubai's Emirates. Indeed, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last year said the government would ""spare no effort"" to ensure SIA made it through the pandemic.
Its majority shareholder, government-owned investment arm Temasek Holdings underwrote one of the world's biggest airline rescue packages. Thanks to that, SIA's has enough funds to keep going for at least two more years without cuts, and is modernising its fleet to save fuel, reduce maintenance costs and meet environmental goals while other airlines shed aircraft. 
""The crisis shows the importance of having a cash-rich state investor as its main backer,"" said a banker, who was not authorised to speak with media and spoke anonymously.
SIA's cash pile is the envy of rivals like Thai Airways and Garuda Indonesia, which have received little government support. Many of SIA's rivals are trimming fleets to a level that could ultimately weaken their hubs and send more connecting traffic to Singapore.
""Basically what these airlines are trying to do is they are trying to ward off their debtors,"" Subhas Menon, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. 
SIA, meanwhile, is improving its fleet and bolstering its budget carrier, Scoot. In Europe and North America, leisure travel has led a recovery; if that holds true in Asia, budget carriers will be crucial for airlines.
Having culled older planes and cut 20% of staff last year, SIA is under less immediate pressure for more downsizing. CEO Goh Choon Phong in May described last year's job cuts as a ""very painful process"" and said there were no plans for more.
But analysts say it could take 12 to 18 months for widespread travel to resume in Asia.
""They can survive for two or three years without making any money,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said. ""But at a certain stage you say, 'is it really worth it? Shouldn't you take tough steps?'""
Less than 9% of rights sold in SIA's recent S$6.2 billion convertible bond issue went to shareholders other than Temasek, showing the state investor is more patient than others about achieving returns.
A SIA representative said the liquidity raised since the start of the pandemic had allowed it to fortify its financial position and make the investments needed to secure its ""industry-leading position"". SIA's cost cutting-measures had been ""tough and comprehensive"", the representative added. 
Bumpy ride for Southeast Asia's national carriers https://graphics.reuters.com/SINGAPOREAIR-STRATEGY/azgpoqrqlpd/index.html 
MODERN FLEET
SIA deferred S$4 billion of spending on new planes over three years after reaching agreements with manufacturers Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
But because of large pre-crisis orders, it is still spending S$3.7 billion on new aircraft and adding at least 19 planes to its fleet this year, including 13 widebodies, despite little demand. 
By contrast, Germany's larger Lufthansa, which earned nearly four times as much revenue annually pre-COVID, has a capital spending budget of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.77 billion) for 2021.
SIA's financial cushioning makes it harder to push back on contracts with manufacturers and lessors. Temasek supports fleet modernisation.
BUDGET ADVANTAGE
With travel in a holding pattern and rivals distracted by financial issues, Scoot has been using some of SIA's cash to boost staff training and invest in new software that helps it calculate more profitable fares for connecting flights. 
""There has been a lot of investment, which is certainly geared toward a future recovery,"" Scoot CEO Campbell Wilson said. ""Those investments I hope will pay off as time passes.""
Thai Airways lost significant market share to budget rivals in the decade before the pandemic, contributing to years of losses, and has yet to formulate a fresh low-cost strategy as part of a restructuring involving $12.9 billion of debt. 
Garuda, Malaysia Airlines and Philippine Airlines are in similar positions, either having completed or about to launch major restructurings. They lost money for years before the pandemic.
""Presumably in shedding their liabilities they will create some unhappy people who were owed money that was never paid,"" Wilson said. ""The extent to which that subsequently constrains them, time will tell.""

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Friday, regaining some of the previous session’s sharp losses, but are still set to end the week in the red amid growing concerns about the strength of the global economic recovery.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.6%.
Concerns that rising numbers of Covid-19 cases, primarily in southeast Asia but also in the more highly-vaccinated west, will blunt progress on the economic recovery have hit sentiment of late.
The major indices in Europe closed sharply lower Thursday, with the DAX in Germany and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. falling 1.7% and the CAC 40 in France dropping 2%. Even with Friday’s advances these major indices are still set to end the week around 1% lower, underperforming the U.S. this week - a reminder of how much more heavily weighted growth-sensitive cyclical stocks are in the Old Continent.
Further evidence of the patchy recovery came with the U.K.’s May flash GDP release which showed growth of just 0.8% on the month, a sharp slowdown from 2.0% growth seen the previous month (a figure that was also revised lower). Manufacturing output fell 0.1% in May, while industrial production rose 0.8%, both much weaker than had been expected.
News that U.S. drugs giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) are developing a Covid-19 booster shot intended to target the highly transmissible delta variant has provided a lift Friday. BioNTech’s stock rose 5% as a result.
In corporate news, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) announced plans to buy Vectura Group in a deal valuing the maker of inhalers at 1.05 billion pounds ($1.44 billion) and trumping  Carlyle Group  's (NASDAQ:CG) 958 million pound offer made in May. The deal fits a recent pattern of U.S. private and public investors vying for U.K. assets that have been left looking cheap by four years of post-Brexit uncertainty.
Elsewhere, Senior (LON:SNR) stock rose 0.8% after the U.K. engineering group lifted its full-year forecast, citing ""clear signs of recovery"" in the aerospace and the oil and gas sectors.
Also of interest, finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 20 largest economies in the world are set to meet later Friday, with corporate tax reform expected to be top of the agenda.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher as traders attempted to balance rising numbers of Covid-19 cases and the associated growth concerns with falling U.S. crude stocks.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday a drop in the country's crude inventories of just under 7 million barrels, while stating that fuel demand soared to 10 million barrels a day in the week before the July 4 national holiday.
At 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $73.47 a barrel, on course for their first weekly decline since mid-May, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $74.47.

LONDON (Reuters) -Wise's record breaking direct listing has come as a relief to other tech firms aiming to go public in the coming months, the bankers managing those deals and to post-Brexit London.
A souring of sentiment towards technology firm flotations in the British capital had been apparent in the disastrous post-IPO trading of Deliveroo and Alphawave. 
But Wise's 7.9 billion pounds ($10.9 billion) valuation and subsequent market performance in London's first-ever direct listing looks set to quell concerns that it is not as receptive to tech companies as other venues such as New York or Amsterdam.
""London has the potential to be a global fintech centre, and someone like Wise listing on the stock markets gives other companies options,"" Rosh Wijayarathna, a managing director in the corporate banking division at Silicon Valley Bank, said.
Wijayarathna, whose bank provided funding for many of the companies which have listed in London, told Reuters there are 10 to twelve tech companies, including several fintech, planning to list on the London Stock Exchange in the next year or so.
""Not only do you have the flexibility of options but also that you can command the type of valuations that you can get anywhere else,"" Wijayarathna added. 
Wise, a cross-border payments firm formerly known as TransferWise, made its market debut on Wednesday, becoming the biggest tech company to list on the London stock exchange. 
""The Wise listing has been a huge success and very positive for the London market in terms of validating it as a great listing location for high growth tech and fintech companies,"" James Fleming, Citi's co-head of banking, capital markets and advisory in the UK and Ireland, said. 
The Wise deal was structured as a sale of existing shares, known as a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, potentially trailblazing a path for others. 
For interactive version click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TF6n1L
WORD TO THE WISE 
Companies including Britain's Checkout.com and WorldRemit and Swedish ""buy now pay later"" giant Klarna, which is Europe's biggest tech unicorn, are among those bankers expect to consider going public in the next 12-18 months.
And while bankers are unwilling to name any names, they expect companies to now consider an initial public offering, a direct listing or a merger with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC), with some as soon as September.
But while Wise has raised hopes, potential market debutants and their bankers will first watch carefully how Wise shares trade after their initial jump. A sharp stock slide could easily undermine confidence and dent London's listing ambitions. 
Wise shares started trading at 800 pence and by 1530 GMT on Thursday had risen to 960 pence.
Professor John Colley, Associate Dean at Warwick Business School, has doubts over the valuation implied by such prices, especially given fierce competition in the payments sector.
Colley noted that the Wise share price as a multiple of sales was running at about 20 times earnings.
""It's the kind of valuation you would attribute to ... a Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),"" Colley said.
However, sources close to the Wise deal, citing analyst estimates that were given to investors before the listing, said an 8 billion pound valuation equated to 13 times projected earnings for 2022, which was in line with its payments peers.
Irrespective of how Wise shares trade, such a large listing will be a signpost for other firms, Keith Grose, head of international business at U.S.-based fintech Plaid, said.

""These types of hugely public success stories within a market serve as an incentive and example to the next generation of entrepreneurs and founders,"" Grose, whose firm is expanding into Britain, added.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",China's corporate bond defaults touch a record high,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Andrew Galbraith
(Reuters) - China's corporate bond defaults have hit a record high this year, highlighting tightening credit conditions and a growing reluctance by regional governments to bail out troubled state-owned firms.
Chinese companies' bond defaults amounted to 62.59 billion yuan ($9.67 billion) in the first half of the 2021, the highest ever, according to Fitch Ratings.
That increasing proportion of defaults by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has raised concerns among some investors that the end of implicit government guarantees on SOE debt could create market instability. 
China's bond defaults hit a record high this year https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DEFAULTS/xlbvgqmorvq/chart_eikon.jpg 
A total of 25 firms defaulted on bond payments in the first six months of 2021, compared with just 19 in the same period last year, the data showed. 
Number of defaulted issuers in China https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DEFAULTS/jbyprzbrzpe/chart_eikon.jpg 
China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) contributed to more than half of the defaults, totalling 36.65 billion yuan.
Concerns over the ability of SOEs to service their debts sparked global alarm in April after China Huarong Asset Management missed a March 31 deadline for filing its 2020 earnings. 
China's SOEs lead defaults this year https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DEFAULTS/ygdpzzjwgpw/chart_eikon.jpg 
Huarong has not missed any bond payments, most recently repaying a maturing $400 million U.S. dollar bond on Wednesday.
Analysts say that more SOE defaults do not necessarily bode ill for the market. 
""SOE defaults could be a blessing in disguise by forcing the state companies to adhere to hard budget constraints and exercise greater credit discipline, the lack of which have been the culprits for excessive investment,"" said Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
""Beijing has been signalling a gradual retreat from government guarantees on state firm liabilities since 2017 ... But they have also reiterated that the bond default risk needs to be diffused in an orderly manner.""
As large maturities loom in the second half of the year, weak regional SOEs with deteriorating liquidity profiles should continue to see higher bond-repayment pressure, said Shuncheng Zhang, a Fitch analyst in Shanghai.

""But a surge in defaults is unlikely as central authorities guide distressed SOEs to negotiate repayment arrangements in advance,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Diverse reasons are driving the rotation in stocks and a slide in bond yields, but weakness in travel, leisure and other COVID-19-sensitive stocks suggest that fears of the Delta variant are doing their part.
Declines in the shares of companies tied to the reopening trade have broadly outpaced those of other so-called value stocks, which have been battered on worries that economic growth will be slower than expected in coming months.
Shares of cruise stocks Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Cruise Lines and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings have slumped 10% and 9%, respectively, in July, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group dropped 4% and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) was off 5%. MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International has fallen 5.5%, while  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group has dropped 1.3%.
The Russell 1000 value index, which includes economically sensitive stocks, has fallen by 0.9% in the same time frame, while the S&P 500 has risen 0.5% in July. 
“There is a lot of uncertainty and I think the market is trying to add up how much risk this poses to global supply chains and activity down the road,” said Steve Englander, head of North America macro strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
Since July 1, a basket of coronavirus-sensitive stocks tracked by Standard Chartered is down 7.3%, and off 9.4% relative to a group of tech and other stocks that outperformed during the pandemic last year.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has dropped about 20 basis points to 1.29% this month and was falling for an eighth straight session, marking the longest streak since a nine-session drop that ended on March 3, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was gaining speed. [nL2N2OK2A4]
The availability of vaccines - including their apparent ability to keep even those infected from developing serious complications - suggests that the extent of the shutdown measures last year to control the virus will not be required.

Still, some regions, including those without as much access to vaccines, are grappling with rising cases or putting restrictions in place. Cases are rising in places such as Spain and England, although the British government plans to reopen the economy later this month. 
In Australia, Sydney has had a strict stay-at-home order in force since late last month, while Japan on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Tokyo, putting restrictions in place through Aug. 22. The pullback in coronavirus-sensitive stocks likely stems in part from concerns the variant spread could restrict travel and slow growth, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. But those stocks may have been due for a decline after such a sharp run, he said. ""A lot of these stocks moved quite significantly off the vaccine news,"" Todd said. ""Part of this is concern about the re-emergence of this variant, but also just the fact ... you are giving some back.""

Premier reaffirmed its demand that the Myer's entire board should resign immediately, sparing the chief executive John King.
""Any other action would be futile, and costly for Myer shareholders who have endured enough,"" Premier said in a statement.
Including King, Myer's board currently has four members – acting chairman JoAnne Stephenson and two non-executive directors.

The top investor said it has also hired a proxy solicitation firm and is trying to procure a copy of Myer's shareholder register ahead of calling an extraordinary general meeting.
Earlier this week, Premier sought the immediate resignation of the entire Myer board after it raised its stake to 15.77% in the retailer. It has been critical of Myer's management and its strategy to shore up profitability and value to shareholders through the years.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday morning as concerns continue to mount about the spread of COVID-19 variants.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.05% by 10:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.14%. Data released earlier in the day said that the consumer price index (CPI) grew a smaller-than-expected 1.1% year-on-year in June, while contracting a bigger-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month.
The producer price index (PPI) grew 8.8% year-on-year, slightly down from the 9% growth seen in May.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.28%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.83%. Rising numbers of COVID-19 cases prompted the government to declare a fresh state of emergency in Tokyo, less than three weeks before the Tokyo Olympic Games are due to open.
The KOSPI slid 1.90% as a record number of COVID-19 cases also prompted neighboring South Korea to move social distancing rules to the top level of 4 for Seoul. The measures will take effect on Jul. 12 and are set to last for two weeks.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.24%.
U.S. government bonds mostly held their advance within the past week. However, the 30-year Treasury yield dropped below 1.90% for the first time since February 2021 during the previous session.
Inflation expectations slid further and investors digested the Chinese data.
“Reflation requires not only the continual increase in growth, there is a fiscal component to it and we’re seeing how hard it is to get some of that fiscal impulse to carry through,”  State Street  Corp. (NYSE:STT  global macro strategist Marvin Loh told Bloomberg.
“Monetary policy continues to drive a lot of the excess growth, and we know what that story looks like, which is lower yields,” he added.
Stimulus measures from central banks remain on investors’ radar over growing concerns that the global economic recovery from COVID-19 is slowing down. While the U.S. Federal Reserve’s minutes from its June policy meeting, released earlier in the week, said it is taking steps to prepare for asset tapering, its European counterpart seems to be taking the opposite approach.
The European Central Bank (ECB) released the results of an 18-month review on Thursday, in which the central bank raised its inflation target to 2% and said moderate overshoots would be tolerated. Group of 20, or G20, finance ministers and central bankers will meet in Venice later in the day.
Investors also remain focused on China, after the State Council earlier in the week that the People's Bank of China could cut its reserve requirement ratio for banks in an unexpected U-turn. In addition to weaker-than-expected data released earlier in the month, there are signs that the economic recovery in the world’s second-largest economy is also slowing down.
On the COVID-19 front,  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will request FDA emergency use authorization for a third booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with BioNTech SE (F:22UAy). The companies are confident that the booster shot will offer protection against the Delta variant of the virus."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti, the brash lawyer who shot to fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Donald Trump before a swirl of criminal charges ended his legal career, was sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison on Thursday for trying to extort  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said Avenatti, 50, ""had become drunk on the power of his platform"" in betraying his client, a youth basketball coach, for his own gain.
""Mr. Avenatti's conduct was outrageous,"" Gardephe said. ""He hijacked his client's claims, and he used those claims to further his own agenda, which was to extort millions of dollars from Nike for himself.""
The sentencing caps a precipitous downfall for a once-obscure lawyer who in 2018 became a cable news and social media fixture, disparaging then-President Trump and even flirting with his own White House run.
Avenatti still faces three other criminal fraud trials, including for defrauding Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.
In the Nike case, Avenatti was convicted for threatening to expose the sportswear company's alleged corrupt payments to families of college basketball prospects, unless it paid up to $25 million for him and another lawyer to conduct a probe.
Nike has denied wrongdoing. ""The verdict and sentence speak for themselves,"" it said in a statement.
Recordings showed Avenatti telling Nike lawyers he would ""blow the lid"" on the company and wipe $10 billion off its stock market value unless it bowed to his demands.
Prosecutors said Avenatti was counting on a big payday to cover his debts.
Avenatti was also convicted of defrauding the coach, Gary Franklin, by not telling him he wouldn't settle unless there were a probe.
Gardephe read extensively from Avenatti's taped words, including multiple profanities, before imposing the sentence, which includes an additional three years of supervised release following prison.
LOSING HIS WAY
Avenatti's lawyers have said he will appeal the February 2020 conviction.
Before learning his fate, Avenatti choked up as he admitted to losing his way following years of ""fighting for the little guy against the Goliaths."" The divorced father of three apologized to Franklin and others.
""TV and Twitter, your honor, mean nothing,"" Avenatti told the judge. ""Everyone wants to ride in a limo with you, but very few are willing to sit next to you on the bus. Even fewer, your honor, are willing to take your calls from prison.
""I and I alone have destroyed my career, my relationships, my life,"" he added.
Franklin had been upset Nike stopped sponsoring his program, and said he wanted simply to restore their relationship. He said Avenatti had ""destroyed my reputation"" within his community.
Avenatti had sought no more than six months in prison.
Prosecutors had sought a ""very substantial"" term, and probation officers recommended eight years.
But the judge said he took into account Avenatti's ""sincere remorse"" and his having spent three months early last year in ""horrific conditions"" at a Manhattan jail, as well as the role of the other lawyer, who was not charged.
Avenatti still faces a July 20 trial in California on charges he stole nearly $10 million from five clients, and a second trial there on bankruptcy, bank and tax fraud charges.
He also faces a January trial in Manhattan for allegedly cheating Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract.

Daniels had sued Trump in connection with a 2016 agreement not to discuss their alleged sexual encounters from a decade earlier, which Trump denies having had.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Bitcoin wallets can be stored offline or online at cryptocurrency exchanges, venues where bitcoin can be bought and sold for traditional currencies or other virtual coins.
With a non-custodial wallet, you have sole control of your private keys, which in turn control your cryptocurrency and prove the funds are yours. With a custodial wallet, another party controls your private keys. Most custodial wallets are web-based exchange wallets.
""We have decided to build a hardware wallet and service to make bitcoin custody more mainstream..."", Jesse Dorogusker, head of hardware at Square said in a twitter thread https:// Many companies have emerged to serve a growing need to protect their assets from online theft. Last month, Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey hinted in a tweet https:// that the company was considering creating a non-custodial hardware wallet for bitcoin. Dorsey is also the chief executive of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). 
Cryptocurrencies reached a record capitalization of $2 trillion in April, but U.S. oversight of the market remains patchy.

LONDON (Reuters) -A U.S. regulator has dropped a case against two former top London currency traders that alleged exchange-rate rigging, the agency said on Thursday, drawing a line under an eight-year pursuit by U.S. authorities. 
The U.S. Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) withdrew its case in federal court against Richard Usher, an ex JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) head of EMEA foreign exchange spot trading, and Rohan Ramchandani,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s former European forex trading head, according to their lawyers, the agency and a court notice.
""The agency made its decision to drop the case on the advice of counsel after careful deliberation of the specific facts and circumstance involved,"" said an OCC spokesman. 
""While the agency is no longer pursuing this particular action, it is committed to holding individuals accountable for their actions,"" the spokesman added.
The men, who have faced no action by British authorities, were acquitted by a jury in U.S. District Court in 2018 on charges of scheming to rig the multi-trillion dollar forex market. They had travelled voluntarily to the United States to face the charges.
But the OCC still sought to ban them from life from the industry and fine them $1.5 million. They were facing another trial later this year, their lawyers said.
""This is a complete and total exoneration for Mr Usher,"" said Jonathan Pickworth of Paul Hastings, adding that the OCC had pursued a meritless case.

""It brings to an end an 8-year-long nightmare, during which he has had to endure two different sets of stressful and costly proceedings in the USA... Mr Usher can now rightly feel completely vindicated and seek to resume normal life,"" he said.
Heather Nyong'o, a WilmerHale lawyer for Ramchandani, added: ""Finally, on the eve of trial, they have dismissed their notice and my client can hopefully feel some vindication after tirelessly fighting these false allegations.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's political action committee will halt donations to U.S. members of Congress who voted against President Joe Biden's election certification in January, the company said on Thursday.
The largest Japanese automaker has faced harsh criticism for donations to some lawmakers - members of then-President Donald Trump's Republican Party - who voted against certification of Biden's win in some U.S. states.
""We are actively listening to our stakeholders and, at this time, have decided to stop contributing to those members of Congress who contested the certification of certain states in the 2020 election,"" the company said.
More than 535 people have been arrested and charged with joining a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Biden's election victory over Trump.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) reported on June 23 that Toyota made $56,000 in total donations to 38 of the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted against Biden's electoral certification and said it was the most any company directly contributed to lawmakers who opposed certification.
That disclosure and subsequent media coverage prompted a frenzy of criticism of Toyota, which had earlier defended the donations.
The Lincoln Project, a group largely of Republicans that are critical of Trump, on Thursday posted an ad calling out Toyota's donations to those Republicans.
A Toyota spokesman did not say how long the contribution halt will last. The company noted its political action committee equally supports Republicans and Democrats and added the company ""has long-standing relationships with Members of Congress across the political spectrum, especially those representing our U.S. operations.""
Many of Toyota's auto plants are in southern states that are home to lawmakers who voted against Biden's win.
Jordan Libowitz, a CREW spokesman, praised Toyota's decision but said ""it shouldn’t take a public pressure campaign to get them to do the right thing, but we’re glad it worked.""
CREW said the second biggest corporate donor directly to lawmakers opposing certification was Koch Industries at $17,500 to seven lawmakers.
Dozens of companies said they would suspend donations in the aftermath of the vote and Capitol violence.

 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said in February its PAC would suspend all donations through 2022 to the 147 lawmakers who voted against certification, as well as contributions through the same period for state officials and organizations who suggested the election should be overturned.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co PACs also suspended donations through 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will order U.S. transportation agencies to crack down on anti-competitive conduct and unjust fees in the rail and sea shipping industries to try to lower costs to consumers, the White House said on Thursday.
Biden will deliver remarks at 1:30 p.m. and sign an ""executive order on promoting competition in the American economy,"" the administration said. The order is expected to include dozens of provisions to boost competition, officials said.
The White House said one part of the president's wide-ranging executive order is aimed at the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC (NYSE:FMC)) and the Surface Transportation Board (STB).
White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that shipping costs had risen dramatically during the months of the pandemic.
The order will urge the STB ""to allow shippers to more easily challenge inflated rates when there is no competition between two routes."" 
Biden will urge the FMC ""to take all possible steps to protect American exporters from the high costs imposed by the ocean carriers"" and to ""crack down on unjust and unreasonable fees,"" the White House said.
The Association of American Railroads said on Thursday that ""competition remains fierce across freight providers"" and warned some proposed reforms would put railroads, ""an environmentally friendly option that invests $25 billion annually in infrastructure – at an untold disadvantage."" 
Railroad stocks fell on the news, including CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC), which were all down more than 6%.
Biden's executive order, meant to foster competition throughout the economy, will include measures ranging from making it easier for farmers to repair their own tractors to requiring airlines to refund baggage fees for delayed luggage.
Reuters first reported some plans for the executive order last week and the White House has since rolled out additional proposals. 
Transport costs for shipping goods have soared during the COVID-19 pandemic at a time of growing consolidation in transportation markets.

The forthcoming executive order ""encourages the independent federal agencies regulating these markets to take steps to promote competition – which will save American businesses money on shipping costs. That, in turn, will lower prices for American consumers,"" a source told Reuters earlier.
The executive order will also address noncompete agreements for workers, licensing requirements, defense contracts, cell phones, agriculture and antitrust enforcement.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>","China targets offshore IPO structure, to require ministry approval -sources","(Reuters) -China's securities regulator is setting up a team to review plans by Chinese companies for initial public offerings (IPOs) abroad, sources with knowledge of the matter said, including those using a corporate structure which Beijing says has led to abuse.
Chinese companies looking to list offshore will also need approval from the relevant ministry, the sources told Reuters, in a break from a decades-old arrangement that did not require them to seek a formal go-ahead from any authorities in China.
The details are the first to emerge after Beijing said on Tuesday it plans to strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore, a sweeping regulatory shift that triggered a sell-off in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.
That announcement came after Chinese regulators launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just days after its U.S. stock market listing. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is establishing a team that will mainly sharpen its focus of companies seeking to list overseas using the so-called VIE structure, said three people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the change.
The VIE structure was created two decades ago to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecommunications, enabling Chinese companies to raise funds overseas via offshore listings.
It has been widely adopted by China's new economy companies, mainly internet firms, that are generally incorporated in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands and therefore fall outside Beijing's legal jurisdiction.
It gives firms more flexibility to raise capital offshore, while bypassing the scrutiny and lengthy IPO vetting process that locally-incorporated companies have to go through.
The CSRC, which had taken a softer attitude towards Chinese companies using the VIE structure, is now looking to run thorough checks, two of the people said.
The regulator has already kicked off a consultation process with leading local banks to work out how the review would be done, one said, adding that it will also seek feedback from global investment banks in the next few weeks.
Under the new process, a company looking to list offshore would need to get the approval from ministries supervising its business, one of the sources said. A fintech firm, for example, would need the go-ahead from the banking regulator.
CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-cyber-watchdog-to-police-chinese-overseas-listings-11625742254?mod=latest_headlines, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that the Cyberspace Administration of China is taking a lead role in Beijing's push to regulate U.S.-listed Chinese companies.
TOUGHER CHECKS
Bankers say the new measures are set to significantly delay the listing process and add uncertainties. 
Beijing, however, says they are needed to crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading.
""Due to the shortcomings of the (regulatory) system, the cost of committing securities-related crimes has been relatively low,"" CSRC chairman Yi Huiman told the Xinhua news agency.
""Illegal activities of listed companies including financial fraud, insider trading and market manipulation are rising.""

The impending checks have already sown disquiet, with Chinese medical data group LinkDoc Technology on Thursday shelving plans for a $211 million U.S. IPO using the VIE structure.
Its decision is likely to be followed by others, analysts said, although they noted that U.S. listings were not barred.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pulling back from record closing highs in a broad sell-off driven by uncertainties surrounding the pace of the U.S. economic recovery. 
As the bond market rallied on a flight to safety, all three major U.S. stock indexes tumbled. The Dow's economically sensitive transports plunged 3.3%, its biggest daily drop since October. 
Still, analysts noted that the market remained close to historical highs.
""We're still effectively at all-time highs, so I wouldn’t read much into today's market action,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York.
""The bond market is reflecting that the probability of there being material inflation over a long period of time is very unlikely, and that’s the fear that had been driving yields higher"" before the recent rally, Pursche added. 
""We’re in a goldilocks scenario, with enough growth to support the economy but not so much that the Fed changes policy beyond what they’ve already announced,"" Pursche said.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest monetary policy meeting, which showed the central bank does not yet believe the economy has fully recovered, yet a debate on tightening policy has begun in earnest.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 259.86 points, or 0.75%, to 34,421.93, the S&P 500 lost 37.31 points, or 0.86%, to 4,320.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 105.28 points, or 0.72%, to 14,559.79.
Sensing cracks in the U.S. economic recovery, traders covered short positions in the bond market. The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell for the eighth consecutive session.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended in the red, with financials suffering the largest percentage loss.
The number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly ticked up to 373,000 last week, a sign that the U.S. labor market recovery remains choppy.
Beijing's ongoing clampdown on U.S.-listed Chinese companies fed into the risk-averse mood.
Since China's opening salvo over the weekend against ride-hailing app Didi Global Inc, Beijing has broadened its scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese companies beyond the tech sector.
Didi shares dropped 5.9%, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Bidu Inc shed 3.9% and 3.7%, respectively.
Big banks are due to kick off second-quarter reporting next week. Analysts expect aggregate year-on-year earnings growth of 65.4% for companies in the S&P 500 index, up from the 54% growth forecast made at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.
""Much like inflation data I want to see what earnings growth over two years rather than one,"" Pursche said. ""That would be a much better guide as to how strong earnings are going to be.""
""Coming out of the pandemic one-year data points are so distorted that they're almost irrelevant.""
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 148 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.56 billion shares, compared with the 10.65 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The United States and Mexico on Thursday agreed that a new union vote will be held at the General Motors (NYSE:GM) Silao plant by Aug. 20, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) and Mexico’s economy ministry said.
Both countries released a joint statement that said Mexico has agreed to a number of safeguards before the vote, including having Mexican federal inspectors and impartial international observers from the International Labor Organization at the facility ahead of the vote. Mexico said in May that it would review labor practices at the GM plant in central Mexico after a formal complaint from USTR.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement the agreement with Mexico will allow workers to vote on whether to approve their collective bargaining agreement in ""free and democratic conditions."" She praised Mexico ""for taking swift action when they recognized that workers’ rights were denied.""
Last month, Mexico sent a letter that formally kicked off a joint negotiation to resolve the U.S. complaint.
Workers had voted in April on whether to keep their current contract, however, halfway through Mexican officials detected ""serious irregularities"", including destroyed ballots and scrapped the vote.
The findings prompted the United States to ask Mexico to review the case for possible rights violations under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Mexico agreed to ""investigate and, as appropriate, sanction anyone responsible for the conduct that led to the suspension of the April vote and any other violation of law related to that vote... or in connection with the August vote.""
The announcement came after 10 days of intense negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico, a senior U.S. official told Reuters.
Mexico's labor ministry said in June that the union at the plant, which employs about 6,000 people in the central city of Silao, must hold a new vote before Aug. 20 or lose the contract altogether.
GM said in a statement it was pleased with the agreement between the United States and Mexico ""to support a free and fair vote in August. We look forward to continuing to work with U.S. and Mexican government officials in support of the shared goal to protect workers’ rights.""
USTR said GM will issue a statement of neutrality ahead of the vote and have a zero-tolerance policy for retaliation.
The U.S. official confirmed the contract would be terminated if the vote does not occur by Aug. 20. The Labor Ministry will oversee the vote, ensure the ballots and voting area are secure, the official added, saying there will be more than five times as many Mexican federal inspectors than the prior vote.
Labor remedies under the USMCA include revoking tariff-free access for the violating factory's goods.

In GM's case, that could mean applying a 25% U.S. pickup truck import tariff on Silao-made trucks, a move that could add thousands of dollars to each vehicle's cost.
The so-called request for review marks the first use of the Rapid Response Labor Mechanism in USMCA, which allows countries to target labor rights violations at specific factories.

Shares in Levi climbed 3% in extended trading as it also increased its third-quarter dividend by 33%.
Customers refreshing their wardrobes following months-long lockdowns and COVID-19-related restrictions are boosting sales of loose-fitting jeans and street clothes at Levi and its peers American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) and Abercrombie & Fitch.
""About 35% of consumers in the U.S. have changed waist sizes. And some of it is up and some of it is down, but either way, it creates another reason for people to go out and update their wardrobe,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Bergh said on an earnings call.
Levi is also benefiting from its collaborations with a slew of brands, including Valentino, and its push toward direct-to-consumer sales that largely helped boost its adjusted gross margin by 670 basis points to 58.2% in the second quarter.
Lower promotions, price increases and sourcing savings also supported margins, said the company, known for its Signature and Levi's (NYSE:LEVI) 501 jeans.
The Denizen and Dockers brands' owner forecast fiscal 2021 per-share profit between $1.29 and $1.33, above estimates of $1.15. It also forecast second-half revenue to be above 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
Net revenue more than doubled to $1.28 billion in the second quarter ended May 30, beating Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.21 billion. Excluding items, Levi earned 23 cents per share, versus estimates of 9 cents.

Revenues through digital channels rose 75% as people have taken to the ease of getting their orders delivered at their doorsteps.
Levi said it would improve its digital business by investing in distribution centers and its program that allows customers to pick up online orders in stores.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stock prices fell while bond prices and the euro firmed on Thursday as investors pared exposure to risk and headed for safety amid a cloudy outlook for the pace of economic recovery. 
But stocks came off of their early declines even as worries about Beijing's crackdown on foreign-listed Chinese firms also took a toll on equities. 
Bond prices, meanwhile, rose strongly, sending interest rates down to 1.2496% on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note during the session. But bonds gave back some of the gains later. 
Investors are beginning to discount the view that reflating economies will force rates significantly higher this year, and instead adjust to the idea of lower-for-longer rates for now.
""The reflation trade is shocked but not dead,"" said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, since rates will eventually have to rise.
""People have been persistently too optimistic because the first four months of year were just gangbusters-good,"" he said.
Investor optimism about the pace of recovery is being tempered after months spent overlooking some bearish economic signals. Unusual items that boosted core U.S. inflation data last month, for example, may have made inflation and growth appear more robust than it was.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 259.86 points, or 0.75%, to 34,421.93. The broad S&P 500 lost 37.31 points, or 0.86%, to 4,320.82. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite dropped 105.28 points, or 0.72%, to 14,559.79.
Among bonds, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.8 basis points to 1.293%. It fell as low as 1.25% earlier in the day. The 30-year Treasury bond was down 1.9 basis points to 1.925%.
Also raising concerns for investors: political tensions in the Middle East, Russia and China that can distract the Biden administration from its domestic agenda, and lessen the focus on domestic policies such as the U.S. infrastructure bill. Also, debate looms about raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
Meanwhile, a reading on Thursday on the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims provided another indication that the job market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be choppy.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday dispelled fears of an imminent monetary policy tightening, but confirmed views that such talk could begin next month.
Shares in Europe fell about 1.8%.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.275 point or 0.3% to 92.369. The euro was last up 0.47% at $1.1844.

Spot gold prices rallied from earlier lows to close down $1.3134 or 0.07% at $1,802.09 an ounce.

However, that doesn't mean investors should run out and buy shares.  Target  (TGT),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), and Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) are three Buffet inspired stocks are better buys right now.With tech stocks leading the market last year, shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) underperformed. The stock gained a paltry 2.4% in 2020, compared with a 16.3% gain for the S&P 500. But this year, the BRK.B has performed much better, up 18% so far year to date. While investors might think it's time to jump into BRK.B, there are better options.
While things are improving for Warren Buffet's company, BRK.B has a Neutral Rating in our POWR Ratings system. Investors would be better off with stocks that fit his philosophy and are rated a Strong Buy or Buy in our POWR Ratings system. To find these stocks, I used the investment strategy outlined in Buffettology, a book written by Buffett's ex-daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett.
These stocks have a 10-year track record of generally increasing EPS, long-term debt not more than five times annual earnings, average ROE over the past ten years of at least 15%, average ROIC over the last ten years of at least 12%, and earnings yield higher than the long-term Treasury yield. When we filter for stocks with Buy ratings or higher, we get companies such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Foot Locker, Inc. (FL), and Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM).

The industry has already been struggling due to year-long travel restrictions compelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we think the shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are best avoided now. Read on.Oil prices hit a six-year high on July 6 after OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement regarding production levels and talks were postponed indefinitely. While oil prices have declined marginally over the past two days, controlled supply levels should drive oil prices higher in the near term.
Rising oil prices are likely to negatively impact the already fraught airlines industry. In response to rising jet fuel prices, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned that oil prices will cast a shadow over the airline industry’s substantial recovery from the pandemic driven slowdown. IATA expects the airline industry to incur losses of $47.7 billion in 2021.
Given the airline industry’s weak recovery, we believe shares of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and  American Airlines Group  Inc. (AAL) are best avoided now.

Deals of a validation flight are still being worked out and the planemaker plans to send a team of 35 pilots and engineers to meet the officials in late July, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/3e0jZLP) 
Boeing had initially hoped that China would let the MAX fly by end-2020, but trade power tensions, regulatory hurdles and attempts by the West to counter Chinese competition are delaying its return.
The company has been all but shut out of new orders in the world's biggest aircraft market since 2017, leading it to cut production of the long-haul 787 model.
Under the Biden administration, Boeing is stepping up efforts to convince China that the plane is safe, aiming to reset its most strategic partnership as air travel picks up from pandemic lows. 
""Following approval from the FAA (U.S. Federal Aviation Administration) and other regulators to resume commercial operations, we have been working with other regulators as they complete their validation processes,"" said Boeing.

Still, it could take many months for the ban to be lifted after the test flight, the report said. 
Shares of the company closed 2% higher at $236.77, after rising sharply on high volumes following the Bloomberg report in afternoon trading.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 04:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Online payments firm Stripe takes first step toward blockbuster listing -sources,"By Anirban Sen and Echo Wang
(Reuters) - Digital payments processor Stripe Inc, the most valuable U.S. technology startup, has taken its first major step toward a stock market debut by hiring a law firm to help with preparations, according to people familiar with the matter.
The 11-year-old company, which was valued by investors at $95 billion in a fundraising round in March, has sat out this year's red-hot market for initial public offerings (IPOs), using private tender offers to allow some of its existing investors and employees to cash out their holdings.
Remaining private has enabled Stripe to keep such financial details as revenue and profitability under wraps. Yet this has also deprived it of using its shares as a publicly traded currency to help finance acquisitions and to incentivize employees.
Stripe has tapped Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as a legal adviser on its early-stage listing preparations, the sources said. There has been no decision on the timing of the stock market debut, and the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later this year, the sources added. The listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources said.
Stripe is considering going public through a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, because it does not need to raise money, said two of the sources, cautioning that those plans could change. 
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Stripe and Cleary Gottlieb declined to comment.
Founded in 2010 by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions every year for millions of businesses worldwide. Its list of clients includes Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. Early investors Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google’s venture capital arm.

Stripe's breakneck growth could result in it challenging Chinese technology giants Ant Group and ByteDance, whose valuations are close to $200 billion, for the title of world's most valuable startup by the time it goes public. 
John Collison told Bloomberg Television in an interview last month that Stripe, which has headquarters in both Dublin and San Francisco, may go public one day but that there were no current plans for a listing.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Thursday, as concerns grew about the global recovery at a time when the delta variant has caused a spike in infections, triggering a jolt of volatility that rattled investor sentiment. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 4,321.81, but had been as low as 4,289.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.8%, or 259 points, and the Nasdaq was down 0.7%. The S&P 500 VIX Futures - or so-called fear index - jumped 17% to 19.00.
Fears over slowing growth were captured in the bond market, with the 10-year U.S. bond yield plunged to its lowest level since February.
But some on Wall Street are not buying the ""peak growth"" jitters and argue that there is runway for the recovery, paving the way for more gains in stocks. 
""We do not think the markets are worried about economic and earnings growth slowing from these robust levels, at least at this point,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).  ""We favor economically sensitive sectors like energy, industrials, materials and financials.""
Beyond the boost from fears over slowing growth, a decline in the supply of bonds issued by the Treasury is also playing a role in boosting bond prices, sending yields lower.
The Treasury holds $733 billion in cash as of July 6, and is ""way behind in making progress toward bringing their cash balances down to the $450 billion target for July 31 prescribed by the debt ceiling legislation,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""These paydowns will help the process along, but we still expect further cuts.""
The spike in Covid-19 cases as the delta variant continues to spread has also put a damper on global growth and threatens the summer of travel, particularly in Europe, 
The labor market, meanwhile, continues to suggest a longer road to recovery as initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 2,000 to 371,000 last week. 
As the enhanced unemployment benefits come to end,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is backing a wave of supply to the hit the labor market that will help plug the current gap.   
""We continue to expect a bump in labor supply late summer as the remainder of the federal supplementary benefit programs are approaching expiration,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.
The sea of red for rates usually translates into gains for tech, but growth sectors of the market also succumbed to selling pressure.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were below the flatline. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), however, bucked the trend to trade higher. 
Banks felt the pain of plummeting rates, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) falling more than 2%.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ""misplaced"" guidance on an important exemption to its rules on dangerous individuals and organizations for three years, the company's independent oversight board said on Thursday.
The board, which was created by the company to rule on a small slice of contentious content decisions, said it had overturned Facebook's original removal of an Instagram post encouraging people to talk about the solitary confinement of Abdullah Ocalan, a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
It said the content should never have been removed, but it also said that after it selected the case, Facebook found a relevant piece of its internal rules had ""inadvertently not transferred"" to a new review system in 2018. 
This guidance made an exception to Facebook's rules, which prohibit support or praise of individuals or organizations it designates as dangerous, to allow discussion on the conditions of confinement. 
Facebook has long been under scrutiny over what is allowed on its platforms and has been criticized by the board for a lack of transparency around its rules. The board said it was ""concerned"" that Facebook had lost an important policy exemption for this time and that this could have led to other posts being wrongly taken down.
It said the guidance, which was not shared with Facebook's policy team, was developed in 2017 partly in response to concerns about the conditions of Ocalan's imprisonment.

A company spokeswoman declined to answer Reuters questions about how the policy was lost. The board said Facebook was conducting a review of how it failed to transfer the guidance but said it was not ""technically feasible"" to determine how many pieces of content were taken down while the guidance was not available. Facebook had restored the content before the board's decision.
The board has recommended Facebook publish the results of its review, including descriptions of any other lost policies.

1203,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 03:48PM ET</span>","Bond Yields, Oil Majors, Meme Stocks: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Investors fled risk on Thursday amid a growing outbreak of Covid cases sweeping the U.S. and the U.K. that threatened to blunt progress on the economic recovery.
The 10-year U.S. bond yield fell to its lowest level since February before recovering some of that ground later in the day. Rates move inversely to prices. The recent move lower in rates comes as expectations for reflation and growth ease, forcing investors to abandon their bearish bets on the bonds.
The outlook on growth has also been soured by a spike in Covid-19 cases as the delta variant first identified in India continues to spread, threatening the summer of travel. Public health officials in the U.S. have urged communities with low vaccination rates to get their shots. 
While falling bond yields are normally good for tech stocks, it wasn’t the case on Thursday, as giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell. 
Cryptocurrency sensitive stocks were hurt by a plunge in bitcoin, as well.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Attention on bond yields
Eyes will be on the Treasury market after the benchmark United States 10-Year fell Thursday to 1.25%, a level not seen since February, as worries over the pace of global economic rebound increase and investors look for safe havens.
Even as vaccinations quicken and people return to work and travel, the fast spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus is the latest headache for policymakers, bankers and economists in balancing growth and inflation targets.
Japan declared a state of emergency today in Tokyo.
2. Energy in focus
Shares of energy companies are also trading weaker as worries over global economic growth return. That has weighed on majors such as  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC ADR (NYSE:RDSa). 
Crude oil rebounded a bit, around $73 a barrel for Crude Oil WTI Futures and $74 for the international benchmark Brent Oil Futures after a bullish inventory report that showed declining crude stocks in the last week.
3. Is the meme trade over?
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares plunged earlier Thursday only to recover in the afternoon, but the extra volatility comes as investors debate whether the rally in meme stocks is finally over.
AMC hit a 52-week high of $72.62 on June 2 and has since come down to around $47, the fall also fueled by traders disappointed over its constant fund raising. Two days ago, the multiplex operator called off one such sale of 25 million shares.

In contrast, its competitors Electronic Arts (EA), Playtika (PLTK), and Ubisoft (UBSFY (OTC:UBSFY)) are strategizing and building new platforms to meet escalating demand. So, we believe these companies are better positioned than RBLX to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Let's discuss.The demand for video games remains robust despite people returning to outdoor activities as the end of the COVID-19 pandemic looms and distancing mandates are eliminated. Indeed, the global video gaming market is expected to hit $293.2 billion by 2027, growing at a 9.3% CAGR. 
Despite the favorable backdrop, Roblox Corporation (RBLX), a San Mateo, Calif.-based online entertainment platform provider, hasn’t been able to keep up with industry trends. Although the newly public company has the potential to grow its user base in the long run, the company might not be able to retain its existing users and grow due to its weak financials. In its last reported quarter, RBLX’s net loss increased 80.5% to $134.22 million, and its loss from operations surged 85.1% to $135.06 million. The stock has declined 5.1% over the past month.
Conversely, video game companies  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA), Playtika Holding Corp.

A quick view on this is looking at the small-caps index which is near its monthly low, while the S&P 500 (SPY) is at 3-month and all-time highs. In this week’s commentary, I will discuss the cause and impact of lower rates and update our market outlook. Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary from the POWR Growth newsletter).
One of the major forces impacting the market is the decline in longer-term rates.
From April, the yield on the 10-year has dropped from 1.75% to 1.32%. The 30-year Treasury had an even bigger drop – from 2.45% to 1.94%. At the same time, short-term rates have slightly risen as the 2-year yield went from 0.15% to 0.25%.

As the demand for housing remains high given low borrowing costs and a heightened desire for improved living spaces ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for construction and building materials is likely to rise. So, we believe building material companies  Owens Corning  (NYSE:OC) and BlueLinx (BXC) should benefit in the coming months. Read on.The housing industry has been one of the best performers amid the pandemic. Ultra-low interest rates and increasing consumer interest in house purchases have been helping the industry grow significantly. The home sales index, which is based on contract signings, rose 8% to 114.7 in May 2021, representing the highest reading for this metric since May 2005. Also, contract signings increased 13.1% year-over-year. However, median home prices increased 23% year-over-year to a $361,750 record high for the four-week period ended June 20.
While COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions resulted in a supply shortage, a substantial rise in home-for-sale listings in June demonstrated a decent recovery. New listings increased 5.5% year-over-year, and 10.9% sequentially in June.
Because of these factors, the building materials industry is expected to grow substantially in the coming months as the demand for housing remains high. So, we think building material stocks Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) (OC) and BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (BXC) are attractive investment bets now.

Let’s discuss.As the world’s largest internet market, China has witnessed the rapid digitalization of various businesses during the pandemic. And it is the first country to recover from the pandemic-driven global recession. The country’s GDP increased 18.3% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021.
To maintain this growth, China has announced plans to increase its R&D spending by 7% between 2021 - 2025 in its five-year plan draft. The IMF has forecast an 8.4% growth projection for China in 2021, compared to 6.4% for the United States. However, a recent Chinese crackdown on Chinese companies’ U.S. listings is a cause for concern.
Despite the regulatory headwinds, we believe small-cap Chinese stocks LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (LX), GreenTree Hospitality Group Ltd. (GHG),  Cango Inc . (CANG), and  Qudian Inc . (QD) have the potential to deliver solid upside in the coming months.

(Reuters) - Japanese state-backed oil producer Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) is seeking a buyer for its 75% stake in the Hangingstone oil sands facility in Canada, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Several global oil majors have rushed to sell their Canadian oil sands assets over the past four years over concerns ranging from high production costs and emissions to scarcity of capital.
Japex unit Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd (JACOS) is the majority owner of Hangingstone, with Chinese state-owned oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) holding the remaining 25%. One source said JACOS could fetch more than C$200 million ($160 million) from the sale, which could attract notable bids as it has abundant oil reserves that would benefit from fresh funding.
JACOS, which did not respond to Reuters requests for comment, is working with an advisor on the sale, the sources said, requesting anonymity while discussing confidential talks.
They cautioned that a final decision on the sale has not yet been reached, and JACOS could still retain it.
The company also owns interests in undeveloped leases in Canada.
Hangingstone, a steam-assisted oil production site which began output in 2017, averaged 23,000 barrels per day in the first four months of this year, according to the Alberta Energy Regulator.
Separately, Calgary-based ARC Resources, which in March bought rival Seven Generations Energy in a C$2.7-billion deal, has sold its Alberta's Pembina Cardium assets to privately held Ricochet Oil Corp for around C$100 million, four sources familiar with that transaction told Reuters.
The deal enables it to focus on becoming a pure-play Montney producer, one of the sources said.
ARC declined to comment and Ricochet did not respond.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top global banks consolidated their stranglehold on the $6.6 trillion a day global foreign exchange market last year, with new entrants ceding ground, a widely watched industry survey showed.
With a combined 30% share of the market in 2020, JP Morgan, UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) took the top 3 positions in the widely watched Euromoney FX survey, as investors made a beeline for vendors offering more electronic trading and algorithmic tools in a year when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional trading arrangements.
A surge in market volatility due to the pandemic last March coincided with a disruption to trading, traditionally rooted in large trading floors at banks and hedge funds in Hong Kong, London and New York, as offices closed and workers were sent home.
That led to a rise in electronic and algorithmic trading and banks who had heavily invested in the space reaped rich rewards.
""Our investment in technology via our electronic and automated trading business was crucial,"" said Chi Nzelu, head of macro eCommerce at JP Morgan, which also held the top spot for 2019. ""Algo trading also came to the fore last year, helping to manage cost and access liquidity efficiently.""
The resurgence of the top banks comes at the cost of new entrants like XTX Markets, a dark pool operator, which had climbed steadily up the rankings to stand in third place in 2019, offering deeper trading liquidity and faster execution facilities.
The London-based market maker slipped to fourth place and also ceded market share.
The pandemic-induced volatility early last year widened bid-offer spreads to levels not seen since the global financial crisis, while reducing market depth even in currency pairs considered to be liquid.
While more widespread in equity markets, transacting via computers and high-powered algorithms has become increasingly popular in currency and bond markets in recent years with the pandemic accelerating the trend.
Banks have made heavy investments in algorithmic trading with top institutions offering a variety of solutions for trading currencies. For example, ""adaptive algos"", offered by many banks in recent months, can change their trading styles automatically depending on fluctuating market conditions.
A study by Coalition Greenwich last month found the disruptions caused by the pandemic may have long-term effects on the behaviour of FX market participants. 

More than 40% of financial FX traders employed algo trading in 2020 with nearly the same share expecting their usage of FX algos to increase in the next year, the study said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 moved off session lows Thursday, as yields cut some losses but sentiment remained fragile amid concerns about the outlook on the global recovery at a time when the delta variant has caused a spike in infections.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to 4,317.84, but had been as low as 4,289.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9%, or 320 points, and the Nasdaq was down 0.7%.
The 10-year U.S. bond yield, which trades inversely to prices, recovered from a slump to its lowest level since February.
The recent move lower in rates comes as expectations for reflation and growth ease, forcing investors to abandon their bearish bets on the bonds.
But some on Wall Street are not buying the ""peak growth"" jitters and argue that there is runway for both the recovery and risk assets.
""We do not think the markets are worried about economic and earnings growth slowing from these robust levels, at least this point,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).  ""We favor economically sensitive sectors like energy, industrials, materials and financials.""
Beyond impact of slowing growth, a decline in the supply of bonds issued by the Treasury is also playing a role in boosting bond prices, sending yields lower.
The Treasury holds $733 billion in cash as of July 6, and is ""way behind in making progress toward bringing their cash balances down to the $450 billion target for July 31 prescribed by the debt ceiling legislation,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""These paydowns will help the process along, but we still expect further cuts.""
The outlook on growth has also been soured by a spike in Covid-19 cases as the delta variant continues to spread, threatening the summer of travel, particularly in Europe. 
The labor market, meanwhile, continues to suggest a longer road to recovery as initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 2,000 to 371,000 last week. 
As the enhanced unemployment benefits come to end,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is backing a wave of supply to the hit the labor market that will help plug the current gap.   
""We continue to expect a bump in labor supply late summer as the remainder of the federal supplementary benefit programs are approaching expiration,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.
The sea of red for rates usually translates into gains for tech, but growth sectors of the market also succumbed to selling pressure.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were below the flatline. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), however, bucked the trend to trade higher. 
In other news, cryptocurrency sensitive stocks were hurt by a plunge in bitcoin as risk-off sentiment spilled into cryptos.
 Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ) were down."
1211,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",15 more U.S. states reach settlement in OxyContin maker Purdue bankruptcy,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Fifteen more states reached an agreement with Purdue Pharma LP and members of its wealthy Sackler family owners that moved the OxyContin maker a step closer to resolving widespread opioid litigation and exiting bankruptcy protection.
All but a handful of states nationwide now support Purdue's bankruptcy plan, with the latest agreement emerging after weeks of mediation. 
The deal, outlined in bankruptcy court papers filed late on Wednesday, was reached after Sackler family members agreed to contribute another $50 million toward a proposed litigation settlement and to release tens of millions of additional internal documents for public inspection. 
Another $175 million would come from relinquishing control of family charitable institutions. The Sackler family members have also agreed to a prohibition with regard to naming rights associated with charitable contributions until litigation settlement funds are fully paid, the documents said. 
In all, the Sackler contributions toward Purdue's bankruptcy-exit plan now total roughly $4.5 billion. 
The plan aims to resolve some 3,000 lawsuits brought by U.S. communities alleging Purdue and its family owners contributed to an opioid crisis that has claimed the lives of roughly 500,000 people since 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Stamford, Connecticut-based company and family members have denied the allegations in the litigation. 
Purdue said that the latest agreement built on support from other creditors in the company's bankruptcy proceedings and that it hoped to reach additional consensus on its plan to move billions of dollars of value into trusts for addressing the U.S. opioid crisis. Sackler family members called the deal an ""important step toward providing substantial resources for people and communities in need."" 
The agreement, supported by longstanding holdouts including Massachusetts and New York, sets the stage for Purdue to gain court approval in coming weeks for its bankruptcy plan, which the company values at more than $10 billion. That value is contingent in part on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications the company has under development.
The plan would dissolve the company and shift assets to trusts run on behalf of plaintiffs that alleged the company and its owners aggressively marketed the painkiller OxyContin while playing down its abuse and overdose risks. 
""While I know this resolution does not bring back loved ones or undo the evil of what the Sacklers did, forcing them to turn over their secrets by providing all the documents, forcing them to repay billions, forcing the Sacklers out of the opioid business, and shutting down Purdue will help stop anything like this from ever happening again,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, the first attorney general to sue Sackler family members, said in a statement.
If approved by the court, the bankruptcy plan would include legal releases shielding the Sacklers from future litigation. A bankruptcy judge halted lawsuits against both the company and the Sacklers after Purdue filed for Chapter 11 court protection in 2019.
""It is upsetting that the Sackler family never declared bankruptcy yet were still granted all the same protections of bankruptcy as their company,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said during a news conference with Healey and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Thursday.
""There is no perfect solution here,"" James added. ""But we can't let perfect be the enemy of the good. This deal gets one of the nation's most harmful drug dealers out of the opioid business.""
Healey, who said she spoke to opioid victims earlier on Thursday, urged reform in aspects of the U.S. legal system that allowed the Sacklers to obtain relief from a federal bankruptcy court. But she welcomed the additional deposition transcripts, emails and other evidence that will eventually ""be online forever, searchable and free to the public.""

Purdue in November separately pleaded guilty to three felonies arising from its marketing of prescription opioid painkillers, part of a separate settlement eclipsing $8 billion to resolve U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil investigations.
Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They previously agreed to pay $225 million to resolve separate civil allegations with the Justice Department. The family members have denied those allegations.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will take greater account of climate change in its core policy decisions, in the latest move by one of the world's biggest central banks to curb carbon emissions.
Europe's most powerful financial authority made its announcement before the launch next week of a package of measures by the European Union, which is striving to lead the world in greening the economy.
ECB President Christine Lagarde, who has spoken passionately about the need for climate action and shared stages with green campaigners such as David Attenborough, has made it a priority to establish the bank's role in the field.
Setting out interventions that will make it substantially more forward-leaning on climate than the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB said on Thursday that climate change would be a factor in policy relating to disclosure of financial information, risk assessment, collateral and corporate sector asset purchases.
""The ECB will adjust the framework guiding the allocation of corporate bond purchases to incorporate climate change criteria, in line with its mandate,"" it said in a statement.
""These will include the alignment of issuers with, at a minimum, EU legislation implementing the Paris agreement through climate change-related metrics or commitments of the issuers to such goals,"" the central bank added.
The EU has set itself a target of cutting net emissions by 55% by 2030 in an effort to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as set out in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.
""Other central banks are going to be reading this and thinking hard about how they can show a similar commitment to greening monetary policy,"" Paul Diggle, deputy chief economist of Aberdeen Standard Investments, said.
The move won cautious backing from environmental group WWF.
""The announcement of the ECB as a result of its strategy review is a major milestone,"" WWF Sustainable Finance Policy Officer Henry Eviston said. ""However, given the climate urgency the implementation of these commitments must now come very fast and apply to all ECB operations...""
While Lagarde stressed that climate change policy was to be led by elected governments and parliaments, she said the ECB had a duty to act because of the risks to financial stability posed by climate change disruption and the huge upheavals that will be needed to put the economy on a sustainable footing.
""It's not just words,"" she told a news conference. ""It's a commitment of the entire (ECB) governing council,"" she said of the forum composed of the heads of the national central banks of the 19-member euro zone.
Other ECB decisions announced on Thursday included:
- development of new models and analyses to monitor the implications of climate change and related policies 
- development of new indicators, covering green financial instruments and the carbon footprint of financial institutions, as well as their exposures to climate-related risks
- a detailed plan from 2022 to require climate change-related disclosures for eligibility as collateral and asset purchases. 
- climate stress tests in 2022 of the balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB itself and the national central banks of the 19-member euro area.
""It's mostly about better information and disclosure as well as taking into account climate risks,"" Guntram Wolff, economist and director at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, wrote on Twitter.
Central banks differ on how deeply they should be involved in broader climate change policy.
While Japan's central bank remains reticent about buying green bonds, it has announced it will provide funds to financial institutions that boost loans and investment for activities aimed at combating climate change.
The People's Bank of China has said it increased the share of green bonds in its foreign exchange reserve investments while controlling investments in high-pollution assets. Its green bond rules ban funding for coal-related projects.

Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey said it was exploring ways to green its monetary policy portfolio after a disclosure report showed the carbon footprint of its asset holdings were consistent with a rise of as much as 3.5-4 degrees by 2100.
With Republican lawmakers breathing down its neck, the U.S. Fed is among the most reticent. While it has begun conducting more research on the economic implications of climate change, Fed chair Jerome Powell insists it is a matter for government and not something that relates to monetary policy.

LONDON (Reuters) -Fully-vaccinated Britons returning from medium-risk amber list countries will no longer have to quarantine when they arrive home from July 19, transport secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday.
The rule change will be a huge boost to airlines and the travel industry which have been brought to their knees by 15 months of restrictions. In Britain, 65% of adults have been fully vaccinated, opening up travel for millions. 
""I can confirm today that from the 19th of July, UK residents who are fully vaccinated through the UK vaccine rollout will no longer have to self-isolate when they return to England,"" Shapps said. 
The need to quarantine on return had prevented a travel recovery. Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the United States and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days. 
Shares in British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and easyJet (LON:EZJ) both traded up 2% immediately after the news, which will also be welcomed by Southern European countries eager for UK tourist revenues. 
EasyJet said holiday bookings to amber countries surged 440% after the government announcement compared to the previous week. 
""We have been delighted with the customer response to the removal of Amber list quarantine for the fully vaccinated, so Europe has now turned Green for the double jabbed,"" easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement. ""This means that millions will finally be able to reunite with family and loved ones abroad or take that long-awaited trip this summer.""
The rule change only applies to amber list countries. For countries on the UK's high-risk red list, fully-vaccinated Britons will still be required to self-isolate in a hotel.
TIGHTENING RULES
While Britain opens up, worries over the spread of the Delta variant from the U.K. could still derail a travel recovery. Italy, Portugal and Spain have all recently tightened entry requirements for Britons, with Italy requiring five days of quarantine. 
Shapps said that Britons returning from amber list destinations would still have to take a COVID-19 test before they arrive home and then a second test on or before day two. Children under the age of 18 will not have to self-isolate but will need to take tests. 
Bookings for the crucial peak late July and August holiday season, when the industry makes most of its profit, are expected to soar following the rule change. 
Airlines and holiday companies like TUI and Jet2 have repeatedly called for an end to quarantine but it will however remain in place for non-Britons for now, said Shapps, disappointing the industry. 
""We're working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU,"" he said. 
He said he would provide an update in due course. 

British Airways said that while it was pleased with Shapps's announcement, it wanted to see progress on scrapping quarantine for non-Britons.
""The government needs to quickly extend this to all vaccinated travellers, agree a reciprocal deal with the US, add more countries to the 'green' list and reduce the need for unnecessary, expensive tests,"" BA chief executive Sean Doyle said.

The company is launching the product in around 400 U.S. restaurants, more than two years after it discontinued a frozen chicken strip offering due to negative reviews. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), known for its faux beef Beyond Burger, launched Chicken Strips as its first alternative meat product in 2012.
Made out of faba beans and peas, the improved faux meat chicken tenders recipe has 14 grams of protein per serving, no cholesterol and contains 40% less saturated fat than the leading foodservice chicken tender, Beyond Meat said in a statement. 
The move to reintroduce a chicken product follows a 26% drop in the company's U.S. foodservice revenue in the three months to April 3. 
In an interview with CNBC, Beyond Meat's chief executive, Ethan Brown, said the chicken tenders were priced keeping foodservice in mind and that the company planned to launch more chicken meat substitutes in the future. The timing of the launch with the reopening of the US restaurants was a co-incidence, he said.

Blissful Burgers, Detroit Wing Company and Melt Bar & Grilled are some of the smaller chains and restaurants where the chicken tenders will be available on Thursday, the company said.
Shares of the El-Segundo, California-based company, which did not disclose whether the product would be sold at grocery stores, were up 1.3%.

ZISLOW, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s supervisory board will discuss on Friday whether to extend the contract of Chief Executive Herbert Diess, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The meeting, at which the sources said the board could decide in favour of a two-year extension for Diess until 2025, is taking place only days ahead of Volkswagen's strategy day scheduled for July 13.
A fresh contract would come shortly after Diess' long-term opponent Bernd Osterloh stepped down as works council head and took a management position at Volkswagen's truck unit Traton.
Diess, whose current contract runs until April 2023, had asked for an early extension towards the end of last year to get more backing for his efforts to reform Europe's top carmaker, but ran into opposition from powerful labour leaders, including Osterloh.
No firm decision has been taken and there is no guarantee that the supervisory board will reach an agreement at its meeting on Friday, the people said, adding several details still had to be hammered out.
A spokesperson for Volkswagen's supervisory board declined to comment.

An extension would give Diess the mandate to fulfil Volkswagen's declared ambition to become the world's largest electric vehicle maker by the middle of the decade and overtake key rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Diess, a former BMW executive, joined Volkswagen's management board in July 2015 before becoming CEO in April 2018 and has been the key driver behind the group's effort to transform itself.

1224,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",Silver Uptrend Under Pressure,"Silver (SLV) has underperformed in recent months. It's surprising given the weakness in real interest rates. However, it could be an indication that the inflationary scenario is less likely given that some inflationary pressures are receding.It’s been a volatile week thus far for the markets, and while gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) has performed quite well, silver (SLV) has taken a backseat, down 2% for the week and unable to hold onto upside momentum. The good news is that the silver/gold ratio continues to remain in bullish alignment, with silver making a new high this year while gold has been unable to get back above $2,000/oz. However, we are going to want to see the silver bulls begin playing defense soon. This is because while pullbacks to oversold levels are a reason to be bullish like we saw two weeks ago, an inability to rally from oversold levels can suggest that a lower low is needed to capitulate the bulls. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Silver’s fundamental backdrop continues to remain the strongest it’s been in decades, driven by demand from the automotive sector and associated infrastructure, continued demand from the solar industry, and 5G broadband cellular networks. This increase in industrial demand combined with what could be reduced investment in one of the largest silver-producing nations due to higher taxation (Peru) could translate to a deteriorated supply/demand picture over the coming years. This should place a strong bid under the silver price and is likely why the metal has performed so well in the face of gold’s weakness this year. The other factor, of course, is that silver tends to outperform gold if a new secular bull market has indeed begun, which the gold price is pointing to, given its new all-time high breakout last year. However, while this bodes well for the bigger picture, short-term momentum remains neutral, and the key to preventing it from turning negative is the bulls playing defense at $24.75/oz.

(Reuters) -Morgan Stanley has disclosed that personal data of some of its corporate clients was stolen in January in a data breach that involved a third-party vendor and hackers accessed information, including social security numbers.
Files stolen also included client names, addresses, date of birth and corporate company names. 
The bank's vendor, Guidehouse, which provides account maintenance services to its StockPlan Connect business, informed it about the breach in May,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a letter dated July 2. 
The bank said attackers accessed information by exploiting a vulnerability in the vendor's server, Accellion FTA. While the exposure was patched within five days, the attackers obtained decryption key even though the files were encrypted.
Guidehouse informed the bank it had found no evidence that the stolen data had been distributed online. 
A person familiar with the matter said the files have been recovered and the bank is monitoring the dark web for any evidence of posting of client information.
The vendor, meanwhile, has engaged credit firm Experian (OTC:EXPGF) to offer free credit monitoring services for 24 months for clients that may have been impacted by the breach, the person said. 

""The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very seriously. We are in close contact with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients,"" a bank spokesperson said.
The hack, which was reported earlier by technology news portal Bleeping Computer, was discovered in March by Guidehouse and its impact on Morgan Stanley was found in May, the bank said.

Investing.com – Shares of banking and lending companies extended losses for the second consecutive day amid fears the Delta variant of the virus could derail the revival in the global economy.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were all down 1.5%-2%. JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) shed the least, falling 1%.
The outlook for bank earnings has been hit by the marked drop in bond yields in recent weeks, as fears about resurgent inflation have given way to concerns that the economic rebound may be flattening out. Falling bond yields depress banks' lending margins and consequently their profitability.
Treasury yields were headed lower Thursday, too, though there was some small recovery from the day’s lows. The United States 10-Year was down 2 basis points at 1.29% as worries over the pace of global economic rebound increase and investors look for safe havens. At one point, it was down 7 basis points.
Yield on the United States 30-Year dropped by a basis point to 1.92%. The yield on the United States 5-Year, more sensitive to expectations of short-term interest rate changes, was down 3 basis points to 0.74%.
Yields and prices are inversely related and one basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The reversal in yields comes after they made new highs in March, when worries over inflation were dominant. Those worries are still not over, but for now, they are sharing the space with concerns over GDP growth.
Even as vaccinations quicken and people return to work and travel, the fast spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus is the latest headache for policymakers, bankers and economists in balancing growth and inflation targets.

So, we think it is better to bet on established credit services companies  American Express  (AXP),  Capital One  (COF), Discover (DFS), and Synchrony (SYF). These names are well-positioned to capitalize on increasing financial transactions amid the fast-paced economic recovery. Read on.Fintech company SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) made its stock market debut on June 1, 2021 by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V, a blank-check company. It made an impressive debut, with its stock rallying more than 12% on the day of listing. However, the stock has lost 20.1% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $16.94. Analysts expect its EPS to remain negative in its fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Furthermore, the company’s trailing-12-month net income margin and ROTA are negative compared to the 28.18% and 1.15% respective industry averages. Given its weak financials and growth prospects, SOFI looks extremely overvalued at its current price level. Its 13.71x forward P/S is 331.1% higher than the 3.18x industry average. So, we think it’s wise to avoid the stock now.
However, the continuing economic recovery and rapid technological innovation are driving the growth of the credit services. According to Research and Markets, the global credit card market is expected to grow at a 3% CAGR to hit $103.06 billion in 2021. Investors’ interest in the credit services space is partly evidenced by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLF) 17.7% gains over the past six months.
So, instead of betting on SOFI, we think it could be wise to bet on the shares of quality credit services companies American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). These companies are well positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

So, we think it is better to bet on shares of Eli Lilly (LLY), Abbott (ABT), and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which are dominant players in the diabetic care market and hold immense growth potential. So, let’s take a close look at these names.
Shares of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system-maker Senseonics Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SENS) have soared 254.6% over the past six months and 680% over the past nine months to close yesterday’s trading session at $3.12. The gains have been driven primarily by r/wallstreetbets subreddit’s interest in it and investors’ optimism surrounding the announcement of positive clinical results from its PROMISE study. 
However, Wall Street analysts expect the stock to hit $0.88 in the near term, which indicates a potential 71.8% decline. This expectation is justified because its sky-high valuation is not in sync with its bleak growth prospects. In terms of forward EV/S and P/S, SENS is currently trading at 96.43x and 96.95x, respectively, which are much higher than the 7.10x and 7.86x industry averages. Its EPS is expected to remain negative in 2021 and 2022. So, we think it’s wise to avoid SENS now.
The global diabetic care market is expected to hit $41.71 billion by 2027, according to an Emergen Research report. More sedentary lifestyles amid remote working conditions and an aging population have been driving a significant increase in diabetic patients. According to SingleCare, roughly 700 million adults worldwide are expected to have diabetes by 2045. Against this backdrop, it could be wise to bet on shares of dominant companies in the diabetic care market Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY),  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO). Based on their fundamental strength and consistent innovations, all three are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for diabetic care solutions.

Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance sees a decline in retail volumes quarter-over-quarter as the meme stock rally goes away.
The brokerage has benefitted immensely from the retail-fueled rally in the markets and balance sheet growth.
The analyst sees considerable leverage in the model to continue to drive strong net new asset growth, benefit from both revenue and expense synergies from the Ameritrade merger, and also drive top line growth through organic as well as inorganic route. But with the stock nearing the target, the upside relative to the rest of his coverage looks limited to Nance.

Tesla's sales of China-made vehicles slipped in June from the previous month, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said on Thursday.
The company, which makes Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, sold 33,155 China-made vehicles, including those for export, compared with 33,463 in May. 
Domestic sales in China improved, however, with Tesla selling 28,138 China-made cars in June, up from 21,936 the previous month. 
Tesla shares fell 1.2% on Thursday and were set to decline for a third consecutive session.
The standard-range Model Y launched on Thursday has a starting price of 276,000 yuan ($42,588), after government subsidies are taken into account, about 20% less than a long-range Model Y.
The price cut allows its base Model Y to benefit from the subsidies, which are offered to new energy vehicles priced below 300,000 yuan. 
Tesla dropped a standard-range Model Y from its U.S. website last year, as CEO Elon Musk said the range was ""unacceptably low"" at less than 250 miles.
The new version, which uses CATL's lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP), can run 525 km (326 miles) per charge, compared with 594 km for the long-range version. 

BYD sold 40,532 so-called new energy vehicles, which include battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, last month in China. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s venture with SAIC Motor sold 30,479 such cars. 
CPCA also said China sold 1.6 million passenger cars in June, down 5.3% from a year earlier.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ottobock is preparing for a blockbuster stock market flotation in 2022 that could value the German artificial limb maker at more than 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion), three people close to the matter said. 
The company, 80% owned by the founding Naeder family and 20% by buyout fund EQT (NYSE:EQT), has asked banks to pitch for roles in the initial public offering, which could become one of the country's largest deals next year. 
Ottobock, which was founded in 1919 as a maker of prosthesis for World War One veterans, has repeatedly said it eventually plans to go public, but has so far not commented on the expected timing of a deal.
""We want to be capital markets ready from 2022. Work towards that milestone is ongoing,"" said a spokesman for the Duderstadt-based company on Thursday, declining to elaborate.
Ottobock's family owners and EQT declined to comment.
The mandating of banks to prepare for an IPO often takes place at least 3-6 months ahead of any deal, and final timing depends on market conditions that need to be favorable for any transaction to go ahead.
The company makes prosthetics, orthotics, wheelchairs and exoskeletons and in 2019 posted core earnings of 191 million euros on sales of 1 billion euros. Last year, it saw revenues drop as shops remained closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Listed peers include Ossur, Hanger Invacare (NYSE:IVC) and Ekso Bionics. 
According to market research, the global $6 billion prosthesis and orthosis market is expected to grow by about 4% annually as populations age and cases of injuries as well as of diseases like bone cancer rise.
While Ottobock has been considering an IPO for years, EQT's stake purchase in 2017 at a valuation of 3.15 billion euros delayed earlier plans. 
Since the buyout group's investment, Ottobock has named former Fresenius manager Philip Schulte-Noelle as Chief Executive. 

It has also sold off its plastic foam materials business to Switzerland's Conzzeta and acquired businesses such as V!GO, assets of peer Freedom Innovations and a stake in distributor Cascade Orthopedic Supply.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro 2020 semi-final victories for England and Italy mean football's either coming home or going to Rome, but the last 20 years show that hoisting the European Championship trophy can also lift a stock market.
Of the last five tournament winners, Greece and Spain's bourses outperformed the pan-European STOXX 600 after their 2004 and 2008 and 2012 wins, while only Portugal's 2016 title was followed by notable underperformance.
Perhaps a reflection of the shock of the victory, the Athens market outperformed by an impressive 20% six months on from Greece's win - long before the country's debt crisis kicked off, of course.
The first of Spain's back-to-back wins in 2008 and 2012 came at the height of the global financial crisis, meaning most stock markets were taking a dive, but the Spanish bourse still managed to outperform by losing 5% less than the STOXX 600. 
In 2012 it was even more dramatic, coming during the second peak of the euro zone debt crisis and just before then ECB President Mario Draghi had calmed things down by vowing to do ""whatever it takes"".
That meant Madrid's IBEX initially slumped despite Spain's 4-0 thumping of Italy in the final. But by the end of that year it was back in form and outscoring the STOXX 600 by around 4%.

DENMARK CONSOLATION 
Analysts have looked into this kind of impact before. A study by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in 2014 https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/archive/world-cup-sections/world-cup-book-2014-equity-markets.html showed that every World Cup winner since 1974 had seen its stock market outperform, with the exception of the 2002 tournament when Brazil’s victory was overshadowed by a deep recession.
On average, the victor's local bourse outperformed the global market by 3.5% in the first month after the final. Goldman found though that the boost usually faded over the next three months and by the time the anniversary of the win came around they were underperforming by 4% on average. 
So what about this year? Well if it's any consolation for Denmark after Wednesday's semi-final defeat to a soft penalty, Copenhagen's bourse has outscored London's FTSE 100 by nearly 5% since the start of the tournament and beaten Italy and the other losing semi-finalist Spain's market by 6% and 8% respectively.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) meanwhile pointed out this week that sterling, the currency, has struggled to match the star performances of its England namesake, Raheem Sterling, on the pitch.
Like the player was in Denmark's penalty box on Wednesday, the pound sterling is down in trade-weighted terms since the tournament started, though that's not uncommon when looking at the currency between the start of the last 13 major competitions England have qualified for, and the day after they bowed out.

""There is sadly no correlation between on-pitch performance and returns in currency markets,"" Deutsche Bank economists said. ""Knockout games have also not seen GBP regularly outperform its rivals following victories, nor weaken after defeats.""

However, the stock is currently trading at a lofty valuation. Given its mixed financials and the fact that it is battling several class action lawsuits, does the stock deserve its current valuation? Let’s find out.Image sharing platform operator Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) is widely known for its pins that are used to spark inspiration among users and save them to boards to keep their ideas organized. The visual social network’s shares soared 200.7% in price over the past year, driven by the company’s launch of advertising in Brazil, and strong growth in its international business. But the stock is now trading 13.5% below its 52-week high of $89.90, which it hit on February 16.
PINS’ stock slumped 7.3% over the past three months but gained 18.8% over the past month. The stock looks expensive at its current price level. In terms of non-GAAP forward P/E, PINS is currently trading at 87.88x, which is significantly higher than the 20.67x industry average.
While PINS’ recent expansion of its Idea Pins across various countries should enable the company to inspire more users to join its platform, and thereby further fuel its brand image, we think its current valuation looks unjustified given the class action lawsuits filed against the company and its mixed financials. So, the stock’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Going forward, the sector continues to look appealing as monetization is increasing. Patrick Ryan looks at two video game stocks and decides which is the better buy: Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Gravity (GRVY).Video games were one of the big winners during the pandemic as gaming surged. Many analysts believed that the total addressable market of the gaming industry may have permanently increased as many who started will become lifelong gamers.
Of course, gaming is one of the most consumed forms of media, however, it's still in the early stages of monetization. Developers are getting more creative by offering premium in-game features and upgrades that are proving successful in getting gamers to spend money.
Since the total market size is growing, there is plenty of opportunities in the sector beyond the well-known console and game developers. Below, we provide a quick look at two such stocks in Zynga (ZNGA) and Gravity (GRVY).
ZNGA develops, markets, and publishes social games primarily played on mobile devices. Though ZNGA games are not exactly epic adventures that prove indelible in the mind’s eye for years to come, they are fun distractions from everyday life.
ZNGA is riding high after its first-quarter earnings results impressed analysts and retail investors. The company's first-quarter adjusted EBITDA was an impressive $123 million. This figure is $55 million higher than that from the same quarter in the year prior. ZNGA's GAAP net losses dropped to -$23 million in the quarter from -$104 million in the same quarter last year. There are also some rumblings that ZNGA might be an acquisition target as the casual gaming crowd continues to serve as wind behind the company's sales.

MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) -Stellantis, the world's No. 4 automaker, said on Thursday it plans to invest more than 30 billion euros ($35.54 billion) through 2025 on electrifying its vehicle lineup.
The company, formed in January from the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, said its strategy will be supported by five battery plants in Europe and North America as it gears up to compete with electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other automakers globally. 
""This transformation period is a wonderful opportunity to reset the clock and start a new race,"" Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on a webcast during the company's ""EV Day 2021"" event. ""The group is at full speed on its electrification journey."" 
Dario Duse, of consulting firm AlixPartners, said the 30 billion euros earmarked for the EV program were a ""conspicuous amount.""
""Former PSA Group already had a good electrified offer that Stellantis will surely try to leverage at best and even the former FCA made steps ahead recently, so the big step up in electrification by 2025 seems achievable,"" he said. 
Stellantis said it is targeting more than 70% of sales in Europe and over 40% in the United States to be low-emission vehicles - either battery or hybrid electric - by 2030. It aims to make the total cost of owning an EV equal to that of a gasoline-powered model by 2026.
It said all 14 of its vehicle brands - including Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Jeep, Ram, Fiat and Opel - will offer fully electrified vehicles. Another focus will be electrifying its commercial vehicle lineup, and rolling out hydrogen fuel-cell medium vans by the end of 2021.
Stellantis said on Thursday that one of the five battery plants will be at its engine facility in Termoli, Italy, joining previously announced factories in Germany and France. The automaker also is in final steps of securing a partner in North America. A source told Reuters that Samsung (KS:005930) SDI may build a U.S. battery cell plant and has been in talks with automakers, including Stellantis. 
Battery partners include Automotive Cells Co, a Stellantis joint venture with TotalEnergies; Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd, SVOLT, Samsung SDI and LG Chem's wholly-owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution. 
Stellantis said it wants to secure more than 130 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity by 2025 and more than 260 GWh by 2030. It said it has signed memorandums of understanding with two lithium geothermal brine process partners in North America and Europe to ensure supplies of lithium, a critical raw material for batteries.
Stellantis said it aims to cut battery pack costs by more than 40% from 2020 to 2024 and by more than an additional 20% by 2030. It plans to use two battery chemistries by 2024 - a high energy-density option and a nickel cobalt-free alternative. By 2026, it intends to introduce solid-state batteries.
The automaker said its EVs will be built on four electric platforms and have driving ranges of 500 to 800 km (300 to 500 miles) on a single charge and fast charging capability of 32 km (20 miles) per minute.
""Stellantis seems to have put in place quite rapidly a unified platform strategy, same thing for the powertrain modularity, which will allow the company to benefit as fast as possible from scale effects,"" IHS analyst Romain Gillet said, adding that the company's targets are in line with its competitors.
MERGER SYNERGIES
At a separate EV strategy event last week, French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) said 90% of its main brand models would be all-electric by 2030, whereas previously it had included hybrids in its target.
Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world's second-biggest automaker after Toyota, expects all-electric vehicles to account for 55% of its total sales in Europe by 2030, and more than 70% of sales at its Volkswagen brand. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said last month it planned to spend $35 billion through 2025 on electric and self-driving vehicles. It has set a target of selling all new light cars and trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035. 
Earlier on Thursday, Stellantis flagged that 2021 got off to a better-than-expected start despite a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Stellantis said its margins on adjusted operating profits in the first half of 2021 were expected to exceed an annual target of between 5.5% and 7.5%, despite production losses due to the semiconductor supply crunch.
It said synergies from its merger were well on track to exceed the first year's target and would help to contribute to a positive cash flow for the year as a whole. Stellantis has promised more than 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in annual synergies.

Shares of Stellantis extended losses after the automaker's EV announcement and were last down about 3.9% in Milan.

Next Digital, owned by jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai, is the publisher of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that closed recently after its newsroom had been raided by 500 police officers investigating whether some articles breached the security law.
In the email, the company said it received copies of resignation letters of Cheung for his positions as an executive director, chief executive officer, a member of the executive committee and nomination committee, as well as his other positions within the group, all with effect from June 30.
The company said given that Cheung was currently remanded in custody, it would make enquiries about the reason for his resignation and whether he had any disagreement with the board.
Earlier in June, Cheung was charged with ""collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security"" under the region's contentious national security law that has faced international condemnations and stoked fears over media freedoms in the financial hub.
The media firm's chief financial officer, Hung Chi Keung, was also resigning, Next Digital said, but confirmed that he was leaving for personal reasons and had had no disagreement with Next Digital's board.

The company added that its chief operating officer had also resigned.
An internal memo accessed by Reuters last week said that the media firm, would cease its operations from July 1 after the company's assets were frozen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday warned of the growing risks posed to consumers and financial markets by the ""highly opaque and volatile"" cryptocurrency market and blasted its lack of regulation as unsustainable.
Warren, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Policy, also raised her concerns in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler on Wednesday, in an effort that could help lay the groundwork for legislation to regulate the fast-growing market.
The former presidential candidate said she needed answers from Gensler by July 28 on the SEC's authority to protect consumers investing and trading in cryptocurrencies, and determine what future congressional action was needed.
Cryptocurrencies reached a record capitalization of $2 trillion in April, but U.S. oversight of the market remains patchy. 
""While demand for cryptocurrencies and the use of cryptocurrency exchanges have sky-rocketed, the lack of common-sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters,"" Warren said in a statement. 
""These regulatory gaps endanger consumers and investors and undermine the safety of our financial markets. The SEC must use its full authority to address these risks, and Congress must also step up to close these regulatory gaps.""
Spokespeople for the SEC and Gensler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have warned that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability and suggested greater regulation may be warranted. 
Officials from the Group of 20 major economies are also expected to discuss the issue when they meet in Venice this weekend. 
Gensler, who became SEC chair in April, has said in the past that cryptocurrencies should be incorporated into the financial regulatory system, but has yet to propose new rules. 
In her letter to Gensler, reviewed by Reuters, Warren said cryptocurrency platforms lacked the same basic protections as traditional exchanges and noted that nearly 7,000 people reported a combined $80 million in losses from cryptocurrency scams in the six months to March 2021. 
Demand for cryptocurrencies has surged over the past year with Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, reporting 2021 first quarter trading volume of $335 billion, a tenfold increase on the same period a year ago. 

Warren asked Gensler to outline the ways in which cryptocurrency exchanges may be undermining the SEC's mission to ensure that markets are operating in a ""fair, orderly, and efficient manner,"" whether additional protections were needed for investors, and whether international regulatory coordination was required.
""The lack of regulation to provide basic investor protections is unsustainable,"" she added.

While the U.S. has vaccinated more than half its population with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and much of the developed is also on its way, the Delta variant, which first emerged in India, has charted its own course. It’s raging through Africa and parts of Asia. New cases of infection are rising in the U.K. and the U.S. as well, raising questions about the pace of economic recovery.
Japan today declared a virus emergency that will last at least through the Olympics that start in its capital Tokyo in two weeks.
Worries about the direction OPEC+ would take with respect to crude prices are also lending to the weakness in crude prices. There are concerns that disagreement about production targets between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two of the largest members of the cartel, could break the body’s tough-to-achieve unity and cause a collapse in oil prices, much like last year.

With governments now pouring billions of dollars to further improve the healthcare industry, and companies in the sector focusing on meeting the healthcare needs of an aging population, the industry’s prospects look bright. So, we think quality healthcare stocks Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX), Owens & Minor (OMI), and Amneal (AMRX), which are currently trading at discounts to their peers, should deliver solid returns in the coming months.The healthcare industry has been the beneficiary of immense investor attention because extensive vaccination drives are helping some of the major economies reopen sooner than expected. This is evidenced by the Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares’ (VHT) 6.4% gains over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.2% returns.
Considering current market volatility, which is partly due to higher-than-expected inflation projected by the Federal Reserve, investor’s interest in the healthcare sector is expected to grow further because it is considered relatively stable in terms of performance given the largely inelastic demand for healthcare products. Furthermore , governments worldwide are spending billions to improve the healthcare industry, and companies in this space are innovating quickly to address the growing healthcare needs of an aging population.
With these factors in mind, we think it could be wise to bet on the shares of quality healthcare companies Hologic, Inc. (HOLX), Owens & Minor, Inc. (OMI), and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE:AMRX). These names look undervalued at their current price levels.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",U.S. banks to see big jump in second-quarter profits before results return to normal,"By David Henry
(Reuters) - With feared pandemic loan losses failing to materialize, most big U.S. banks are expected to report a stunning rebound in quarterly profits next week even as trading income slumps and lending revenue stalls on low interest rates and weak demand.
Among them, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the country's three largest banks, will more than double their second-quarter profits, according to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, is expected to get back into the black for the second quarter after last year posting its first loss since 2008.
A year ago, the country's largest four banks booked $33 billion combined to cover expected loan losses as millions of Americans struggled financially amid pandemic lockdowns.
But due to extraordinary government stimulus and loan repayment holidays, those losses have not materialized and as Americans get back to business-as-usual, the big four could record less than $1 billion of provisions for the second quarter, according to analyst estimates. 
Together, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are expected to report $24 billion in second-quarter profits compared with $6 billion last year, the analyst estimates show. 
""Normalization is playing out,"" said analyst Jeff Harte of Piper Sandler. ""We're getting there.""
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan will be the first big banks to report this quarter when they unveil their results on Tuesday, July 13.
Analysts, though, will be scrutinizing big banks' pre-provision profits to understand how they are really performing. 
Generally, they expect a slump in core businesses amid low interest rates and lack of loan growth, particularly on credit cards which many Americans, who reduced spending amid lockdowns, were able to pay off with help from stimulus checks. 
Trading revenue, which soared across Wall Street last year due to wild volatility, is also expected to fall.
At JPMorgan, for example, pre-provision second-quarter earnings will be down about 20% on the year-ago period, according to estimates by Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. 
That will be driven by a decline in lending-related interest income and trading. CEO Jamie Dimon said last month that JPMorgan trading revenue could fall as much as 40% as markets become ""more normal.""
Still, JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks should make up some of the shortfall thanks to a record-breaking takeover boom which has showered them with advisory fees.
Financial advisory revenue at Goldman Sachs, for example, could jump 65% from a year earlier, according to UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.
""We're set up for M&A to take the headlines,"" said Harte of Piper Sandler, adding some banks will also report strong fees from securities underwriting. 
Goldman, which has less lending exposed to swings in loss provisions, is expected to report a 50% jump in profit on the strength of its advisory and underwriting businesses, analysts estimate.

For some Wall Street banks, however, the deal fee windfall could have less of an impact on the bottom line this quarter. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), for example, may not show the same gain in investment banking fees as its peers because fewer of its deals closed in the quarter, according to research by analysts at RBC Capital Markets.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",Analysis: Falling U.S. bond yields may signal death knell for 'reflation' stock trade,"By David Randall and Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock investors are watching the dramatic moves in the Treasury market for clues on the fate of one of this year’s most successful plays - the so-called reflation trade that helped power shares of economically sensitive companies higher after nearly a decade of underperformance. 
Investors piled in to shares of energy producers, banks and other companies expected to benefit from a powerful economic rebound earlier this year while betting that Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, would rise. 
That trade appears to be tottering now, as worries over slowing growth send yields tumbling to their lowest level since early 2021. [nL2N2OK0R4] While stock markets have appeared largely placid, with the S&P 500 hovering near a record high, a rotation beneath the surface has accelerated in recent weeks, as investors move out of economically sensitive names and back in to the big technology and growth stocks that led markets higher for most of the last decade.
""If we do see a further drop in interest rates, if we do get below that 1.3% level in any kind of meaningful way, that is going to confirm that growth over value has returned and it is not just a head fake,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. 
Stocks pulled back on Thursday, with the S&P 500 down more than 1% in early trade.
The S&P 500 had gained 7% through Wednesday since the 10-year Treasury yield hit a recent high in mid-May. A look under the hood, however, shows signs that a change in stock-market leadership may be taking place. The Russell 1000 growth index gained over 13% since mid-May while the counterpart value index climbed about 1.5% over the same time.
""We do not expect the reflation and rotation trades to return to their former glory,"" while materials and energy stocks will likely be held back by falling commodity prices, noted Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. ""The big boost to rotation from recovering risk appetite and rising growth expectations may mostly be over,"" he said. 
Graphic-U.S. value vs growth stocks in 2021 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VALUE/xklvyxjlkpg/chart.png 
Concerns about the economic impact of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and falling commodity prices are helping push bond prices higher. At the same time, the Federal Reserve surprised many investors last month with a hawkish turn that suggested two interest rate hikes by 2023, calling into question its commitment to allowing inflation to run hot for a time.
One key question for investors is whether recent signs of rising inflation - including the latest data on existing home prices, which showed them rising by their fastest pace in 15 years in April - will be short-lived. 
Federal Reserve officials last month felt further progress on the U.S. economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" but agreed they should be poised to act if inflation or other risks materialized, minutes of the central bank's June policy meeting showed.
""The market going into the last FOMC meeting assumed that the Fed was comfortable with an inflation overshoot, but it became clear that the magnitude of how comfortable they were with an overshoot came down considerably,"" said Mike Sewell, a portfolio manager T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), who expects that the 10-year Treasury has already hit its highest level for the year. 
Stocks’ relative calm does not mean that equity investors are impervious to growth worries.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said on Wednesday in its mid-year investment outlook that it cut its position in U.S. equities to neutral, in part due to expectations that corporate profit margins will decrease. [L2N2OJ1BS]

Meanwhile, a client survey from JP Morgan showed net bearish bets against Treasuries falling to their lowest level since late April in the week to July 6, while bullish positions stood at their highest since late March, suggesting there may be limited fuel for more downside moves in yield.
""It will be interesting to see how positioning unfolds to see if there is enough of a washout to make the market cleaner and just more driven by fundamentals,” said Chuck Tomes, associate portfolio manager on the global multi-sector fixed income team at Manulife Investment Management.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's antitrust regulator said on Thursday it had opened an inquiry into a deal between sports streaming app DAZN and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) on Serie A matches, saying it could affect competition.
Betting on soccer to promote its fast broadband and pay-TV services, TIM sealed a technical and distribution agreement with DAZN, which secured the rights to screen the matches of Italy's top flight soccer league over the next three seasons for 2.5 billion euros ($2.95 billion).
Under the deal, TIM will cover more than 40% of the annual payments DAZN, owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, has to make to Serie A, a document seen by Reuters showed.
But the watchdog warned that some aspects of the accord ""could lead to significant distortions of competition"", limiting competitive development in the pay-TV market and related businesses, including fixed retail, wholesale broadband services and mobile telecommunications. 
The authority said it would assess whether some of the competition concerns might be alleviated by taking steps such as a potential suspension of clauses to limit DAZN's ability to distribute its services on other platforms.
It said it could impose some precautionary measures if any ""irreparable and serious damage"" to competition emerge during the probe, which must be concluded by June 30, 2022.
TIM shares were down 3.1% at 1255 GMT compared with a 2.5% fall in Italy's blue chip index.
In a detailed response to the watchdog's move, TIM said it was confident that after discussions with the authority all aspects of the case would be clarified.
It added the deal with DAZN was meant to boost ""competition in the pay-TV market, the viewing of streaming content and to accelerate the country's digitalisation process to the benefit of all customers and telecommunications operators"".
DAZN's CEO for Italy and Spain, Veronica Diquattro, said during an event in Milan the company was confident it had behaved in a proper manner and had always acted in accordance with market rules. 

Comcast-owned pay-TV operator SKY Italia, which launched its broadband service last year, and other TIM rivals had challenged the phone group deal with DAZN on antitrust grounds, saying it could strengthen TIM's already dominant position in the broadband market.

1255,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Wall Street Tumbles at Open as Growth Fears Mount; Dow Down 470 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets tumbled in early trade on Thursday as technical factors in the bond market combined with fears over the strength of the economic recovery and concerns about regulatory actions, both in the U.S. and China.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 472 points, or 1.4%, at 34,210 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite meanwhile underperformed with a drop of 1.6%. The S&P and Nasdaq had both closed at new record highs on Wednesday.
Stocks were hit by, among other things, a modest rise in initial jobless claims that suggested that progress in the labor market is stalling, along with news of antitrust initiatives in the U.S. and China. Railroad stocks were hit by a Wall Street Journal report that the Biden administration is planning an executive order to break the market power of big transportation companies, while China's antitrust regulator handed out a series of maximum fines that again weighed on Chinese ADRs. 
Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) stock fell 8.0% on concerns that the administration will stop the takeover battle currently being waged for it by  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) and  Canadian National Railway  (NYSE:CNI), anxious to prevent any further concentration in the sector. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock also fell 1.3%, after a raft of states filed suit against it for allegedly abusing its dominant position as operator of the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play store. The action was the latest regulatory headache for Big Tech but failed to generate any underperformance for the stock. 
Sentiment was also spooked by the sharp fall in U.S. Treasury yields in recent days, which has as usual weighed heavily on banking stocks. However, some analysts warned that there may be less to this than meets the eye. Marc Ostwald, chief strategist with ADM ISI in London, said in a morning note that much of the decline in yields was due to new Treasury issuance calendar going through a dry spell, while the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program has continued at the same frenetic pace. 
""I don’t think that we really need to ascribe much of the Treasury moves to the growth and inflation outlooks, but rather to the dynamics and structural forces in place in the U.S. Treasury market,"" Ostwald said. He noted that the Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing index, despite its surprise fall last week, remains well above anything seen in recent pre-pandemic times.
Chinese ADRs continued to struggle, with Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) in particular heading for a fourth straight day of losses - down 6.0% - as investors who had bet on a quick profit at last week's IPO continued to bale out of the stock. Overnight news that China's antitrust regulator had fined Didi, Tencent and others token amounts for historical failings kept the mood music negative. SoftBank (OTC:SFTBY) ADRs also fell 2.0% after the Financial Times reported that China's most popular fitness app Keep - backed by both Softbank and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) - had pulled plans for a U.S. IPO in the light of the Didi debacle. The news illustrated how much harder it may get in future for China's big Internet empires to unlock the value in their various portfolios."

The Financial Conduct Authority said several of Lloyds' insurance units sent renewal notices to millions of customers while failing to ensure the language was clear, fair and not misleading.
""Millions of customers ended up receiving renewal letters that claimed customers were being quoted a competitive price which was unsubstantiated and risked serious consumer harm,"" said Mark Steward, executive director at the FCA.
The breach involved nine million renewal communications between 2009 and 2017, the FCA said. 
In addition, around half a million customers were told they would receive a ""loyalty"" discount, but this was not applied and was never intended to apply, the watchdog said.

Lloyds has since paid around 13.5 million pounds to customers who were told about the discount, the FCA said.
A Lloyds spokesperson said: ""We're sorry that we got this wrong. We've written and made payment to those customers affected by the discount issue and they don’t need to take any further action.""

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>",U.S. states allege Google 'unlawfully' preserves Play Store monopoly,"By Diane Bartz, Paresh Dave and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON/OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Thirty-seven U.S. state and district attorneys general sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Wednesday, alleging that it bought off competitors and used restrictive contracts to unlawfully maintain a monopoly for its app store on Android phones.
The allegations about Google's Play Store stem from an investigation involving nearly every U.S. state that began in September 2019 and have already resulted in three other lawsuits against the company. The cases threaten to force major changes to how it generates billions of dollars in revenue across its businesses, including advertising, in-app purchases and smart home gadgets.
Google said on Wednesday the litigation was about boosting a handful of major app developers that want preferential treatment rather than about helping small businesses or consumers. It maintains that unlike Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its App Store on iPhones, Android supports competitors to the Play Store.
""Android and Google Play provide openness and choice that other platforms simply don't,"" the company said in a blog post.
The states, led by Utah, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee, argue that Google has generated ""enormous profit margins"" from the Play Store by engaging in illegal tactics to preserve monopolies in selling Android apps and in-app goods.
In the United States, Google Play accounts for 90% of Android apps downloaded, according to the lawsuit.
""Google leverages its monopoly power with Android to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in the Android app distribution market,"" the lawsuit stated.
The states pointed to agreements already targeted in other lawsuits such as those Google has with mobile carriers and smartphone makers to promote its services. 
But they added fresh claims after newly reviewing internal company documents. The states alleged that Google bought off developers so they would not support competing app stores, and that through numerous secret projects it intended to pay Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, whose rival app store posed the biggest threat, to stop competing.
Samsung (KS:005930) declined to comment.
The plaintiffs, which include California and the District of Columbia, also say Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company's payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales. The ""extravagant commission,"" compared with the 3% other marketplaces charge, has forced app makers to raise prices and consumers to spend more, the states said.
""Google Play is not fair play,"" Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a statement. ""It must stop using its monopolistic power and hyper-dominant market position to unlawfully leverage billions of added dollars from smaller companies, competitors and consumers beyond what should be paid.""
The states want the consumers to get their money back. They also called for civil penalties and a court-imposed monitor to ensure Google eases the process for consumers, app developers and smartphone makers to use or promote alternatives to the Play Store and the official payment system for 20 years. In addition, the states seek to stop Google's payments to Samsung and developers.
The states said on Wednesday they have not ruled out taking similar action against Apple over its App Store.
The filing drew praise from Meghan DiMuzio, executive director for the Coalition for App Fairness, which represents companies including  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH) and  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) that oppose some of the Play Store rules.
""Anti-competitive policies stifle innovation, inhibit consumer freedom, inflate costs, and limit transparent communication between developers and their customers,"" DiMuzio said.
FEARING SAMSUNG
The lawsuit said that while Google does enable consumers to avoid the Play Store, it displays ""generally misleading warnings and hurdles"" to discourage such activity.
Google does not break out Play Store's financial performance but has said the unit along with several others together generated $21.7 billion in revenue last year, or about 12% of overall sales. 
Google's worries about Samsung grew after the South Korean company worked with video game maker Epic Games Inc to exclusively launch ""Fortnite"" for Android devices in 2018, according to the lawsuit.
Epic's bypassing of the Play Store cost Google some millions of dollars in revenue, the states said.
Google ""immediately launched multiple coordinated initiatives designed to block the emergence of a competing [Samsung] Galaxy Store,"" the lawsuit said. ""Google viewed these projects as an integrated approach to eliminating the threat of more developers following Epic's lead.""
Last year, Epic itself sued Google and Apple separately in federal court in California over app store policies. Proposed classes of developers and consumers have joined the cases. 
A judge's decision in the Apple fight is expected in the coming weeks, and a hearing on Google's effort to dismiss the case against it is scheduled for July 22.

The lawsuits come amid growing antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies, but regulators suffered an early blow last week when a judge dismissed a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The ruling should not affect the Play Store case because it covers different circumstances, the states suing Google said.

ABUJA (Reuters) -Nigeria's revenue service said on Thursday it had told banks to freeze the accounts of units of pay-TV group MultiChoice to recover $4.4 billion, in the latest tax dispute between a South African-based company and Nigerian authorities.
Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) said it had instructed banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Africa and its Nigerian subsidiary for breaching agreements and denying access to records for auditing.
Shares in MultiChoice, which denied the accusations and said the issue could be resolved amicably, fell more than 5% in Johannesburg.
The case follows another dispute in 2018 involving South African mobile operator MTN Group whose Nigerian unit was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017. The demand was later dropped.
FIRS said in a statement it had appointed commercial banks and agents to recover 1.8 trillion naira ($4.38 billion) from MutliChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria.
""It was discovered that the companies persistently breached all agreements and undertakings with the Service, they would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,"" FIRS said.
""The companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company,"" it said.
Nigeria, with one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world, has been seeking to boost non-oil tax receipts to support its struggling economy and cut its budget deficit.
MultiChoice said it had not been formally notified about the matter but said the case appeared to be based on ""unfounded allegations"" that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities. 
""We have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,"" it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.
It said its operations in Nigeria were continuing.
MultiChoice Group, spun off in 2019 from Naspers, makes a third of its revenues from its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment, the company said in its annual report.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese medical data group LinkDoc Technology Ltd has shelved plans for an IPO in the United States due to Beijing's clampdown on overseas listings by domestic firms, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
It is the first Chinese firm known to have pulled back from IPO plans since China's cybersecurity regulator toughened its approach to oversight last week with an investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just two days after its New York debut. That was soon followed with an order for Didi's app be removed from app stores.
Beijing also said on Tuesday it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore, a sweeping regulatory shift that triggered a sell-off in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.
LinkDoc's decision to suspend its $211 million IPO, first reported by Reuters, is likely to be followed by others, analysts said, although they noted that U.S. listings were not barred per se.
""For companies applying for a U.S. listing, they may have to wait for further clarification, stricter scrutiny and pre-approval from different regulators and authorities,"" said Bruce Pang, macro & strategy research head at China Renaissance Securities.
""The new rules may impose long waiting periods on any companies hoping to list abroad which will hit investor sentiment, depress valuations for IPOs in the U.S. and make it more difficult to raise funds overseas,"" he said.
Backed by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Health Information Technology Ltd, LinkDoc filed for its IPO last month and was due to price its shares after the U.S. market close on Thursday.
It had planned to sell 10.8 million shares between $17.50 and $19.50 each. The book closed one day earlier than planned on Wednesday, one of the three sources and a separate person said.
The sources declined to be identified as the information has not yet been made public.
LinkDoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) were the investment banks on the deal and all declined to comment to Reuters.
DEALS IN DANGER
U.S. capital markets have been a lucrative source of funding for Chinese firms in the past decade, especially for technology companies looking to benchmark their valuations against listed peers there and tap an abundant liquidity pool.
So far this year, a record $12.5 billion by Chinese firms has been raised from 34 U.S. listings, Refinitiv data shows, well up from the $1.9 billion from 14 deals in the same period a year ago. 
Eight Chinese companies including home service platform Daojia Ltd and Atour Lifestyle Holdings have made public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list in the U.S. later this year, a review of the filings showed.
The tougher stance by the Cybersecurity Administration of China has been driven in part by concerns that the United States could gain greater access to data owned by Chinese firms - similar to concerns that the previous Trump administration had voiced about Chinese firms operating in the United States. 

In May, Reuters reported that Beijing was pressing audio platform Ximalaya to drop U.S. listing plans and opt for Hong Kong instead, with one source at the time citing Beijing's concerns that U.S. regulators will potentially gain more access to audit documents of New York-listed Chinese companies.
Analysts also note the tougher stance coincides with new U.S. regulations being rolled out that could see Chinese companies delisted if they do not comply with U.S. auditing rules.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Ray Cameron, a prominent executive in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s investment stewardship team who oversaw the money manager's interactions with hundreds of U.S. companies, will take another position in the firm, the asset manager said.
BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, confirmed information by two sources familiar with the matter that Cameron will be moving to its institutional client business where he will have a client-facing role with pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and corporate clients.
BlackRock declined any other comment on the matter.
BlackRock hired Cameron as head of investment stewardship for the Americas three years ago, giving him a powerful voice in the governance world as BlackRock is often one of the biggest owners in most companies.
Cameron will transition into the new role at the end of the third quarter when the annual proxy voting season has largely ended. 
The move comes roughly a year after BlackRock hired former McKinsey & Co partner Sandy Boss to head its investment stewardship operations around the world. Boss is based in London and reports to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink. Cameron is based in New York.
With $9 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock has become increasingly influential in guiding corporate behavior and has recently signaled that it is taking a much tougher stance on climate and sustainability issues.

Every year BlackRock, Vanguard Group and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Group vote on critical corporate issues like lobbying disclosures and a company's stance on climate change and can help decide who sits on a company's board.
Cameron joined BlackRock from Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) Corp, where he was head of corporate access. He replaced Zach Oleksiuk who joined investment bank Evercore where he advises companies on engaging with investors, including activist hedge funds.

Investing.com – Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI), Tencent (NYSE:TME) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) stocks were lower during Thursday’s premarket trading as the Chinese regulator fined them for a series of irregularities related to merger deals over the past decade.
Didi stock fell 6%, Tencent stock 4.6% and Alibaba stock 2.8%.
The State Administration for Market Regulation fined all three on Wednesday, and while 500,000 yuan ($77,000) is small change for the country’s big tech, it is the maximum amount allowed under China’s antitrust law for merger deal transgressions, according to Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post.
Some of the deals receiving punishment occurred before SAMR was formed in 2018, the SCMP said.
The fine comes at a time when Beijing has intensified its scrutiny of domestic technology companies, particularly those listed on U.S. exchanges. The contentious issues include data security, consumer privacy and anticompetitive practices.
Last weekend, Chinese authorities asked Didi to stop onboarding new users and asked stores like WeChat and Alipay to take them off their platforms.
In a brief statement on Tuesday, China’s State Council said rules for overseas listings will be revised and publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. It also said China will step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets.
As many of those firms are listed on the Nasdaq or the NYSE, Chinese authorities are concerned about the data on their consumers these companies are required to share with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other American authorities to comply with the listing norms.
The new restrictions threaten to stop the companies affected from unlocking value in the various subsidiaries of the business empires they have created. Elsewhere on Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Keep, China's most popular fitness app, had pulled plans for a U.S. listing. Keep's backers include Tencent and Japan-based SoftBank (OTC:SFTBY).

Banks and insurers globally are figuring out how to manage the return of staff to their offices after the coronavirus outbreak had forced groups to reorganise their work models, with most employees having been allowed to work remotely.
""The model will be hybrid. Our view is (that) a good balance would be 60% in the office and 40% at home. We also believe that it has to be organised,"" CEO Philippe Donnet said, speaking at an online event.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, Generali only allowed employees of some of its units to work remotely a few days a week.
The new model ""cannot be based only on the (personal) choice of people,"" Donnet added. 
No one would be allowed to stay at home the whole time, while those who wanted to come into the office every day will be able to do so, he said.
The executive said Generali had started discussions on the matter with unions. 

Italian bank UniCredit will allow its non-branch staff globally to work from home for up to two days a week on average once the crisis is over, it said last week.

(Reuters) -Ladbrokes owner Entain expects full-year 2021 profit to be ahead of the current consensus and reported a jump in first-half net gaming revenue on Thursday, with record bets placed on the Euro 2020 soccer tournament as sporting events resumed.
Entain expects core earnings of 850 million to 900 million pounds ($1.17 billion-$1.24 billion), ahead of current market consensus, and better than the 843.1 million pounds reported in 2020 and 761.4 million pounds in 2019.
After a year marred by cancelled sporting events and closed retail betting shops, an increase in online gambling during the pandemic-induced lockdowns have helped bookmakers. 
Entain reported its 22nd straight quarter of double-digit growth in online net gaming revenue, up 22% in the three months to June, when the Euro 2020 kicked off a year late.
Shares in the firm, which owns bwin and Coral brands, settled 0.4% higher by 1111 GMT after having rising as much as 2%, still outshining the blue-chip index. 
""We expect trading to improve further once the retail businesses are free of COVID-19 restrictions,"" Peel Hunt analysts said, raising their target price to 21 pounds.
Entain said the Euros tournament was its biggest ever sports betting event, estimating customer bets on the tournament to be about 250 million pounds. Wagers on Sunday's final between Italy and England were seen at 17.5 million pounds. 
Hargreaves analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said England's semi-final victory on Wednesday could contribute ""to the news that underlying cash profits are expected to beat consensus at the full year.""
Entain said to date about 1.45 million pounds was riding on Italy winning, with 1 million pounds on an England victory.
The firm, which recently bought European groups Bet.pt and Enlabs AB, said it was doubling investment in its game development studios as it increases its focus on online betting. 
Entain said volumes at its retail shops since reopening were only a tenth lower than before the coronavirus crisis.

But the easing of lockdowns in Britain has hit some online earnings, with 888 flagging a 20% drop in average daily revenue since May.

In this case, talks held a decade ago centred on design standards for AdBlue, an additive used to cleanse nitrogen oxide from the exhaust gases produced by diesel-powered cars.
""This is a first,"" European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told a news conference in Brussels. ""We have never had a cartel whose purpose was to restrict the use of novel technology.""
Under a settlement, Volkswagen will pay a fine of 502 million euros and BMW 373 million euros. Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), also part of the cartel, was not fined after revealing its existence.
Vestager said the German carmakers, which included VW units Audi and Porsche, had possessed the technology to reduce harmful emissions more than required under EU law but avoided competing to do so.
""So today's decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude,"" said Vestager.
The EU had narrowed the original scope of its investigation to ensure its charges stuck.
IS TECHNICAL COLLUSION POSSIBLE?
Vestager said that all of the parties had agreed to settle the case and ""have acknowledged their role in this cartel"".
Volkswagen, however, said it was considering whether to take legal action, saying the penalty over technical talks about emissions technology set a questionable precedent.
""The Commission is entering new judicial territory, because it is treating technical cooperation for the first time as an antitrust violation,"" Volkswagen said, adding that the fines had been set even though no customers had suffered any harm.
The nub of the carmakers' complaints boil down to whether setting common technical standards amounts to anti-competitive behaviour - or whether indeed it makes it easier for an industry as a whole to embrace new technology.
The Commission said in its 2019 charge sheet that the German carmakers had colluded to restrict the size of AdBlue tanks between 2006 and 2014, thus making the urea-based additive less convenient to use.
BMW noted in its defence that it had been cleared of suspicion of using illegal 'defeat devices' to cheat emissions tests.
""This underlines that there has never been any allegation of unlawful manipulation of emission control systems by the BMW Group,"" BMW said in a statement.

In the Dieselgate scandal, VW admitted to using such defeat devices, leading to more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in vehicle refits, fines and legal costs for the Wolfsburg-based carmaker.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Thursday, falling back from record levels as key employment data points to a slowdown n the U.S. recovery just as the Federal Reserve starts thinking about tightening monetary policy and Covid cases surge globally.
At 9 AM ET (1300 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 475 points, or 1.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 55 points lower, down 1.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 195 points, or 1.3%.
The broad-based S&P 500 closed Wednesday up 0.3% at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.3%, or over 100 points, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed just higher, another record close.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, with initial jobless claims rising 2,000 from the previous week to 373,000, an indication that the labor market recovery from the Covi-19 pandemic continues to be choppy. The number of claims had been expected to fall to a new post-pandemic low of 350,000. 
The numbers add to concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 virus, and particularly the delta strain, on global economic growth. They come on the same day that Japan declared a state of emergency for the Tokyo prefecture, on the eve of the summer Olympic Games.
A number of Asian countries are struggling with new outbreaks, while the U.K. recorded over 30,000 new cases on Wednesday, for the first time since January.
“New outbreaks are still one of the biggest downside risks in terms of the sustained economic recovery moving forward,” Mathias Cormann, secretary-general of the OECD, said Thursday.
This minutes from the Federal Reserve last policy meeting, released Wednesday, showed that some policymakers think the economic conditions need to start scaling back the central bank’s bond-buying program could be ""met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data.""
In corporate news, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be in focus Thursday the day after a number of states took the owner of Google to court alleging it operates an illegal monopoly with its Google Play app store. Railroad stocks may also come in for scrutiny after a report by The Wall Street Journal saying that the Biden administration is preparing an executive order aiming to break the market power of big transportation companies.
Elsewhere, oil prices dropped Thursday, falling for the third consecutive session, on the back of the concerns about global growth and amid continued uncertainty over future OPEC+ production levels after a dispute halted talks earlier this week.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a reduction of almost 8 million barrels from stockpiles last week, largely matching the 8.2 million-barrel draw recorded during the previous week, and traders will be looking to see if the official figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirm this.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's internet watchdog, which stunned investors with an investigation into Didi Global two days after the ride-hailing giant's New York stock market debut, has come to the forefront of Beijing's sweeping efforts to rein in its tech sector and enforce tightening data security efforts.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), set up in its current format in 2014 by President Xi Jinping, implements online censorship that has tightened dramatically under his tenure. The agency champions Beijing's policy of ""internet sovereignty"" that keeps China's massive online ecosystem behind the country's Great Firewall.
Its move against Didi and two other firms that recently went public in the United States was swiftly followed by Beijing's announcement that it will clamp down on overseas-traded Chinese firms - many of them U.S.-listed tech companies - including tightening regulation of cross-border data flows and security.
Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor of Chinese studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said that in China, as elsewhere, there is growing wariness over the power and influence of big tech.
""So we are at a point where the stars are aligned for action to be taken against these companies, and then it all happens nearly at once from all these different angles,"" he said, referring to measures by various regulatory bodies.
The CAC's move follows high-profile investigations and penalties meted out against ""platform economy"" companies since late last year by different regulators, in particular the country's increasingly active competition watchdog, the State Administration for Market Regulation.
The CAC, Creemers said, is asserting its cybersecurity mandate. 
""Is this about turf or substance? It's about both,"" he said.
The CAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Accusing Didi of illegally collecting users' personal data, the CAC called for Didi to stop accepting new users in China, saying Didi's app ""has serious violations of laws and regulations pertaining to the collection of personal information"". 
Asked about the CAC's recent action, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said authorities manage and make safety checks on internet platforms to mitigate risk and safeguard national security.
""China's policy remains unchanged. We continue to open up and support the development of internet platforms and we will continue to encourage Chinese companies to engage in international exchanges and cooperation,"" he said.
POWERFUL AND BUSY
With frequent regulatory actions and warnings, the CAC looms large over China's sprawling internet.
Its public WeChat account includes descriptions of events and speeches, announcements of enforcement actions and, like those of other party and state organs, propaganda extolling the virtues of Xi and the ruling Communist Party. 
This week, WeChat deleted dozens of LGBT accounts run by university students, saying some had broken rules, a move that followed a CAC pledge to clean up the internet to protect minors and crack down on social media groups deemed a ""bad influence"".
In April, the agency launched a hotline to report online comments that defame the Communist Party and its history, vowing to crack down on ""historical nihilists"" - those propagating information that undermines sanctioned narratives - ahead of the party's 100th anniversary on July 1.
In more run-of-the-mill measures, it joined in April with other regulators in publishing guidelines dictating how apps must protect user privacy and personal information. In January it canvassed public opinion to update old rules covering online payments, shopping and livestreaming platforms.
In 2019, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-refinitiv-idUSKCN1T42AE that financial information provider Refinitiv, the news service's biggest customer, blocked politically sensitive Reuters stories from its financial customers in China, under threat from the CAC of having its service shut down.
The CAC has also in recent years overseen the removal of tens of thousands of news, social media and gaming apps from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s China app store and other local services.
COLOURFUL HISTORY
The CAC's early years were defined by its swaggering boss, Lu Wei, who oversaw the creation of China's annual World Internet Conference, which has attracted such global tech titans as Apple's Tim Cook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) chief Sundar Pichai to the eastern tourist town of Wuzhen.
The inaugural 2014 event drew pushback from foreign tech firms when organizers sought agreement on a last-minute declaration on ""internet sovereignty"". Industry representatives ultimately declined to sign the pledge.
Lu famously traveled to Silicon Valley that year, where he was greeted at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) headquarters in Mandarin by founder Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook, like most big foreign social media and news sites, was then and remains blocked by the Great Firewall.

Lu, who abruptly stepped down in 2016, was expelled from the Communist Party in 2018 and jailed in 2019 for 14 years for taking bribes worth nearly $5 million, one of the most senior officials caught up in Xi's sweeping anti-graft campaign.
The CAC has since 2018 been headed by Zhuang Rongwen, a vice minister in China's central propaganda department. He attends the Wuzhen internet conference but, like most senior Chinese bureaucrats, tends to avoid the spotlight.

Investing.com – Maersk (CSE:MAERSKa) was down almost 2% in the Danish market on a report that the Biden administration will push regulators to confront consolidation and perceived anticompetitive pricing in the ocean shipping and railroad industries.
The Biden administration believes the concentrated nature of the ocean shipping trade and the U.S. freight rail business has reduced competition and led to higher pricing that has made it expensive for American companies to get goods to market.
According to The Wall Street Journal, an executive order will be issued this week to the Federal Maritime Commission and Surface Transportation Board to stop the trend and adopt rules to discourage noncompete agreements.
It's the latest high-profile action by the Democratic president, who has stacked his administration with advisers skeptical of corporate power.
The news broke too early in the day for it to have an immediate effect on traded railroad stocks such as CSX (NASDAQ:CSX),  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) and  Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC). The order comes at a time when the railroad industry is facing further consolidation, with CPR and  Canadian National Railway  (NYSE:CNI) locked in a takeover battle for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).

Italian consumer group Altroconsumo said a court ordered Volkswagen to pay 3,300 euros ($3,900), plus interest, to each of the more than 63,000 consumers who joined the class action, for a total amount of over 200 million euros ($236 million). 
Altroconsumo said Volkswagen was found liable for an unfair commercial practice after installing banned software on EA189 engines in order to lower NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions during tests.
A spokesperson for Volkswagen said the German automaker considered Altroconsumo's class action inadmissible and that its allegations were without merit. 
""Volkswagen will seek to have the judgement overturned by the second instance court in Venice"", the spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""Class members have not suffered any economic loss because of the NOx issue since all vehicles are technically safe and roadworthy, and no loss in their trade value resulted in the Italian market because of the NOx issue"", the person added. 

Altroconsumo started legal action against Volkswagen in 2017, together with its sister organisations in Belgium (Test Aankoop/Test Achats), Spain (OCU) and Portugal (Deco), as part of a Euroconsumers coordinated class action.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian telecoms firm Telenor has sold its Myanmar business, blaming the difficulties of operating under the military junta and dealing a blow to activists who say they relied on the only Western operator for communications.
Telenor, one of the biggest foreign investors in Myanmar, sold its Myanmar operations to Lebanese investment firm M1 Group for $105 million, announcing its retreat from a country that slid into chaos after a military coup in February.
It was one of the few Western companies to bet on the South East Asian country after it emerged from military dictatorship a decade ago. Myanmar accounted for 7% of Telenor's earnings last year. 
Graphic: Telenor's earnings in Myanmar - https://graphics.reuters.com/TELENOR-MYANMAR/dgkvlrkgwvb/chart.png 
""There are three reasons why we think a sale is necessary: it is the safety of our employees, but also the regulatory conditions and also that there is good compliance,"" Telenor CEO Sigve Brekke told Reuters.
""When we wrote off the business in May, we felt we could still operate in the country, although it was challenging. But after that, it has worsened."" 
In May, Telenor booked a loss of 6.5 billion crowns ($738 million) after seeing its mobile business in Myanmar severely restricted following the Feb. 1 military coup.
On March 15, the junta ordered a nationwide shutdown of mobile data, making it harder for pro-democracy activists to organise protests and circulate messages supporting the overthrown civilian government. 
Violence since the Feb. 1 coup has driven more than 230,000 people from their homes. More than 880 people have been killed by security forces and 5,200 are in detention, the United Nations says.
Myanmar's junta has banned senior foreign executives of major telecommunications firms from leaving the country without permission and it is pressuring them to fully implement intercept technology that would let authorities monitor users, a source told Reuters earlier this week.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Activists expressed concern over the exit of Telenor, one of two foreign operators present alongside Qatar's Ooredoo. The other operators in Myanmar are state-backed MPT and Mytel, which is part-owned by a military-linked company.
""We are mostly relying on Telenor,"" campaigner Thet Swe Win told Reuters. ""Most of the activists rely on it as a company which has respect for human rights. I hope that the new company will respect human rights as Telenor did in the past.""
M1 Group was a major investor in Myanmar's largest independent tower company, Irrawaddy Green Towers (IGT), which has a master lease agreement with military-backed telecom Mytel. Private equity company CVC said in February it would buy IGT from M1 Group and other shareholders.
M1 Group was not immediately available for comment.
Some Telenor investors welcomed the decision. 
""It is positive to see that Telenor did not compromise on their basic principles regarding human rights,"" said Janicke Scheele, head of responsible investments at DNB Asset Management, Telenor's 6th largest investor with a 1.51% stake.
""We have had multiple dialogues with Telenor on this and this undoubtedly presented a considerable dilemma for the company,"" she told Reuters. 
The Norwegian state-controlled operator has operations in the Nordics as well as in Asia, where 95% of its 187 million customers reside - in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand, as well as Myanmar.
It has around 18 million customers in Myanmar, serving a third of its 54 million population.
Mads Rosendal, senior analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research, said the price tag was low, given how much Myanmar has contributed to Telenor's earnings.
""On the margin we ... see this as slightly credit negative as we had hoped to see a higher value,"" he said.

Telenor's shares traded at 148.05 crowns at 0921 GMT, unchanged from Wednesday's close.

Filed in the U.S. District Court, the suit alleges the company has monopolized the distribution of apps on devices running the Google-owned Android operating system, blocking competition through contracts and technical barriers.
In a blog post, Google said it provides an open operating system in which customers are free to download apps directly from developers’ websites.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 05:12AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Turkey's banks set for capital healing after pandemic battle -sources,"By Ebru Tuncay and Orhan Coskun
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey is considering a fresh capital injection for state banks but they also need a plan to deal with lingering bad debt after the lenders depleted their resources helping Ankara's battle against COVID-19, senior bankers and government officials say.  
    While privately-held peers were more conservative, the state banks nearly doubled their lending last year, helping the $720-billion economy avoid a contraction and mount a strong recovery helped by a speedy coronavirus vaccination campaign. 
Now, authorities want the lenders to be ready for another burst of credit later this year or next to meet pent-up demand from builders and other borrowers, the six sources told Reuters, requesting anonymity. 
    But their depleted capital requires a boost, especially given they need provisions https://tmsnrt.rs/3qVvF82 ahead of an end-September deadline when more soured loans - including from the hard-hit service sectors - will need to be classified as non-performing loans (NPLs).
""The state banks went above and beyond last year financing large projects. There was an excessive use of resources and they need to be strengthened with capital support,"" said one official with knowledge of the matter.
""As some past loans are paid back, there will be a need for further credit growth for some sectors of the economy at least for next year,"" the person said.
The bankers and officials said, however, no final government decision has been taken on a capital injection, nor has one been made on what to do about the unpaid so-called Stage 2 loans and NPLs, most of which have been lingering on the balance sheets of both private and public lenders since a 2018 currency crisis. 
Shifting them to one or more asset management company, or a ""bad bank"", remains a leading option, two of the sources said.
Turkey's Treasury had no immediate comment.
A Turkey Wealth Fund official said banks' capital adequacy ratios ""are currently at a good level"", adding the fund ""is always ready to support banks if there is a need"". 
The fund injected 21 billion lira ($2.5 billion) of capital into the big three state banks in early 2020, just before their lending shot up by 90%, including low-interest loans meant to ease fallout from the pandemic.
IN THE RED
The public lenders are booking losses in the face of high costs and the central bank's 19% policy rate, which is meant to tackle inflation that is nearly as high. 
First quarter results show the two biggest state banks' net interest income was in the red while the biggest private lenders, including Garanti Bank, Is Bank, Akbank, Yapi Kredi, were in the black.
    Halkbank's overall net profit dropped 93% in the quarter from last year, while Vakifbank and Ziraat Bank were down 56% and 49% respectively. 
They urgently need capital in order to generate another credit expansion later this year or next, said a senior banker. 
""It's not a matter of capital adequacy ratio or liquidity needs. It's a matter of their ability to boost new loans for growth. That's why state banks need an urgent capital increase,"" the banker said. 
A second senior banker told Reuters: ""Growth cannot be achieved with the current capital levels."" 
Turkish state vs private banks' provisions for NPLs https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-BANKS/xegvbzbyyvq/chart.png 
NPL RESOLUTION
Fitch Ratings agency said last month ""risks remain high"" for the sector due to the rapid loan growth and exposure to sectors like tourism and hospitality, which could compound risks for banks already saddled with bad construction and energy debt. 
The 2018 crisis laid bare Turkey's heavy reliance on cheap foreign credit and put a sharp brake on economic growth until the first quarter of this year, when the economy expanded 7%.
Despite the economic upturn and a low sector NPL ratio of 3.7%, the BDDK bank regulator extended a forbearance period - introduced last year - to Sept. 30, after which many Stage 2 loans must be classified as non-performing. 
Banking association data shows ""watch list"" loans rose by 23% to 370 billion lira by the end of last year. 
The bankers told Reuters the deadline made a capital injection more urgent especially given state banks' relatively low loan-loss provision ratios. 
    ""Banks may face a significant increase in provisions for NPLs if the grace period ... is not extended again,"" said a third banking source. 
In an official decree published early on Thursday, the BDDK bank regulator asked banks to prepare a three-year NPL management strategy including resolution units and annual operational plans, in order to reduce them in a reasonable time.
A year ago Ernst & Young submitted to banks a blueprint for an asset management company (AMC) that would house billions of dollars of NPLs and ease the long-simmering problem, though some lenders are cool to the plan. 

""It may be possible to resolve these issues through the asset management company. It doesn't look easy otherwise,"" said a second government official. The NPL forbearance ""cannot go on forever. We have to face reality.""

(Reuters) - British homebuilder  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) on Thursday brought forward its dividend payment to next month, joining smaller rivals in forecasting strong demand even after a tax holiday on property purchases ends in September.
An extended stamp duty break, cheap loans and increased preference for larger homes from buyers who saved up during lockdowns have helped homebuilders forecast higher returns for the medium term.
Persimmon, the country's second-largest homebuilder that offers a range of homes from studio apartments to five-bedroom houses, said revenue for the six months to June 30 surged 53% to 1.84 billion pounds.
""Customer demand for our new homes has been strong right across the UK with healthy sales reservation rates through the period,"" Chief Executive Officer Dean Finch said.
In recent weeks, mid-sized players Redrow, Vistry and Crest Nicholson have also expressed confidence about robust demand going forward.
House prices have risen in recent months as buyers rushed to get deals done by the end of June when the tax break began to taper off. But data from RICS published on Thursday showed fewer homes were put up for sale and buyer demand grew less fast ahead of the end of a tax break in September. 
Persimmon's forward sales stood at 1.82 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), slightly lower than 1.86 billion pounds a year earlier.
With 1.32 billion pounds in net cash, Persimmon expects to return 110 pence per share of surplus capital to shareholders as an additional interim dividend next month, as opposed to two payments in August and December.
""Persimmon is fully back on track, with most metrics improving to above pre-pandemic levels,"" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. 

Shares of the FTSE-100 company were 1.7% lower at 0722 GMT, in line with broader weakness on the London stock market.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian food delivery company Zomato's initial public offering (IPO) is priced at 72 to 76 rupees per share, giving it a valuation of as much as $7.98 billion, the company said on Thursday, as it cashes in on a pandemic-led surge in online ordering.
Zomato, backed by China's Ant Group and one of India's most prominent startups, said its offer will include a fresh issue of shares worth up to 90 billion rupees and a share sale worth up to 3.75 billion rupees by top shareholder Info Edge (India), taking the total offering to 93.75 billion rupees($1.25 billion) according to a filing https://www.bseindia.com/downloads/ipo/Zomato_RHP_070720212008.pdf.
At the upper end of the price range, Zomato's market value comes up to 596.23 billion rupees ($7.98 billion), with subscription set to open on July 14. 
Zomato, launched in 2008, collates restaurant reviews and offers home delivery of food, making it a competitor to Accel-backed Swiggy and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s food delivery service.
""While we had a footprint across 23 countries outside India as of March 31, 2021, we have taken a conscious strategic call to focus only on the Indian market going forward,"" Zomato said in its prospectus. 
In India, an ongoing wave of COVID-19 has pushed many patrons towards ordering in, a trend that has helped companies like Zomato and its peers.
The company had filed for an IPO in late April. 
""In terms of valuation, financials, and future business prospects, we feel things are going to look good for Zomato in the near-term,"" said Shikher Jain, manager, fundamental equity research at Anand Rathi in Mumbai.

The chief of Oyo Hotels, another well-known Indian startup, said on Wednesday upcoming IPOs would be looked at very closely as the SoftBank-backed hospitality firm is considering a potential offering.

SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Chem Ltd and its wholly-owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution (LGES) plan to invest a combined 15.1 trillion won ($13.17 billion) in South Korea this decade, LGES said on Thursday.
Across the globe, countries are racing to bolster EV battery supply chains as demand for electric vehicles surges to combat climate change and automakers partner with battery makers to ensure uninterrupted supplies.
China is dominant, but South Korea is relatively well-placed, with plans to invest a combined more than 40 trillion won through 2030, the country's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.
That includes money from Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd and SK Innovation Co Ltd and other battery material makers, as well as Thursday's announcement from LG Chem and LGES.
LGES supplies batteries to automakers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
By 2030, it will invest 12.4 trillion won to expand its South Korean production capacity and to develop next generation battery technologies, while LG Chem plans to invest 2.7 trillion won. 
LGES said it has battery orders worth 180 trillion won and aims to increase its annual production capacity to 260 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2023, which could power about 3.7 million electric vehicles. 
With battery production sites in the China, Poland and the United States as well as South Korea, the company had an annual capacity of about 120 GWh of batteries as of end of 2020.

In March, LGES said it plans to invest $4.5 billion in the United States in its battery business through 2025.

With most stores reopened after closing during the pandemic, sales of Swiss watches are seeing a strong recovery. The company, which sells Rolex, Cartier and Omega timepieces, has been expanding its store network and boosting online sales.
""We think the UK luxury watch market will increase between 8% and 10% per year over the next five years. We'll outperform that by a couple of points,"" Brian Duffy told Reuters.
Although Britain was unlikely to see a fast recovery in overseas visitors, who no longer benefit from tax-free shopping, he said domestic demand remained strong as the company opened more stores and boosted online sales.
The company, which acquired U.S. jeweller Mayors in 2017, said U.S. revenue was expected to grow 25%-30% a year in the next five years supported by acquisitions and other investment. The United States now accounts for a third of group revenue.
""We're very bullish on the U.S. We think the market is obviously underinvested and underdeveloped,"" Duffy said.
The group plans to spend 300 million to 340 million pounds ($413 million-$468 million) to expand, with up to 200 million pounds of that to be spent on acquisitions in the United States and European Union, a region the company expects to account for 5%-8% of group sales by 2026.

WoS, which confirmed its fiscal 2022 guidance of 16%-21% sales growth, said sales rose 13.3% to 905.1 million pounds in the 53 weeks to May 2. Adjusted earnings before interest tax jumped by 39% to 77.6 million pounds.

President Supramaniam Shanmugam said the association had been ""inundated with expression of concerns from global buyers"", including queries from embassies, hospitals and healthcare sectors. 
Malaysia supplies around 67% of total gloves consumed globally.
Malaysia last week imposed tighter restrictions on movement, businesses and factories in the capital Kuala Lumpur and neighbouring Selangor state until July 16 to combat a spike in new coronavirus infections.
The largest glove makers Top Glove Corp and Hartalega Holdings said they had suspended operations. Top Glove said it was awaiting clarification from authorities.
""Notwithstanding, the huge economic losses to the nation, we nevertheless, have a more important duty and responsibility to ensure no disruption to this very essential medical item,"" Supramaniam said.

The statement also quoted French medical glove distributor Euromedis SA noting Malaysia's obligations to ensure adequate supply of medical gloves to hospitals.
""This sudden closure is sending a bad signal that Malaysia is not capable to fulfill its global supply as a leading medical glove producer,"" Chairman Mathieu Roturier was quoted as saying.

(Reuters) -Britain's Deliveroo reported an 88% jump in quarterly food orders and raised its annual order value forecasts on Thursday, as people remained hooked on having meals and groceries delivered to their home.
The food-delivery firm, which connects customers with over 115,000 restaurants and grocers in the UK and 11 other countries, predicted gross transaction value (GTV) would grow 50%-60% in 2021, compared with an earlier forecast of 30%-40%.
Shares in Deliveroo, which fell 30% in their London market debut in March, climbed 4% to 333.7 pence by 0805 GMT. They are still down 14% so far from their initial public offering price.
Deliveroo and rivals like Just Eat Takeaway.com - which make money by taking a percentage of each order - have enjoyed a surge in both meal and grocery orders as coronavirus curbs forced outdoor shops and restaurants to close.
Still, Deliveroo said investments in ""growth opportunities"" this year and its expectation that average order values would at some point revert towards pre-Covid levels, led it to estimate profit margins were likely to come in at the lower end of a 7.5% to 8% range it had given earlier.

""We believe trading (for Deliveroo) is likely to be driven by both businesses, food delivery and grocery,"" analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a client note. ""The higher investments are not a surprise, given higher investments also for peers.""
Just over half of Deliveroo's GTV - the monetary value of all orders minus any tips - came from the United Kingdom and Ireland in the quarter ended June, it said.

Myer's response comes after Solomon Lew, Premier's billionaire chairman, raised his stake to 15.77% in the retailer and called for a board overhaul, saying the current board did not have the skills required to turnaround the company's performance.
Premier has been critical of Myer's management and its strategy to shore up profitability and value to shareholders through the years, as the retailer tried to keep pace with online peers even before the COVID-19 pandemic dented its earnings. 
""We remain of the view that constructive discussions are in the best interests of all shareholders ... our invitation to sit down with Premier Investments stands,"" Myer's spokesperson said on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Premier said it had nothing to gain from spending time with members of the current Myer board, and the ""only thing"" it would accept was the resignation of Myer's three remaining non-executive directors.
Myer's board currently has four members - acting chairman JoAnne Stephenson, non-executive directors, and Chief Executive John King.
Earlier this week, Premier had called for the entire Myer board to resign immediately. 
Myer's bottomline has been strained by store closures amid the pandemic, with the 120-year-old firm reporting a 13% drop in first-half sales in March. 

The company also had to contend with sluggish consumer spending in Australia, weighed by slow wage growth, as well as growing competition from internet giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have undercut business by selling more products for less.
Myer's inability to secure the support of its largest shareholders had cost the then chairman Garry Hounsell his reappointment last year, with retail veteran Lew's company demanding a board overhaul.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Denmark's biggest lender Danske Bank has increased its net profit outlook for this year as signs of a post-pandemic economic recovery lower loan impairment charges and boost customer activity. 
Banks worldwide have had to make large impairment charges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the global economy, but Danske Bank now expects net profit of more than 12 billion Danish crowns ($1.9 billion) in 2021, up from previous guidance of between 9 billion and 11 billion crowns.
Shares in the bank are up about 14% since the start of the year and gained 4% by 0805 GMT on Thursday.
""We adjust our net profit guidance for the year based on lower than expected loan impairment charges – due to a faster than anticipated macroeconomic recovery – as well as higher customer activity,"" Chief Executive Carsten Egeriis said in a statement. 
An up to 500 million crown gain from the merger of its MobilePay service with two other mobile payment platforms - announced late in June - was not included in the revised outlook, the bank said.
Danske's preliminary second-quarter impairment charges would be about 200 million crowns, it added, below the 745 million crowns expected by analysts in a poll compiled by the bank. 
Impairment charges, which reflect a bank's estimation of the macroeconomic situation and how many of its loans could turn bad, are now expected to be no more than 1.5 billion crowns this year, down from a previous forecast of no more than 3.5 billion crowns. 
Danske Bank said it expects net profit for the second quarter to come in at about 2.8 billion crowns, compared with 2.5 billion crowns expected by analysts.

The FTSE-250 listed-company said it signed deals for 18 tech accessory stores at Britain's biggest airports, including Heathrow and Stansted, which it expects will deliver about 60 million pounds ($82.65 million) in annual sales in a fully recovered travel environment. [PnNDL9DrQ9L]
The retailer of books, travel and tech accessories at train stations, airports and workplace kiosks added it would spend about 15 million pounds on the new stores in fiscal 2022, which would trade under the InMotion brand it uses in North America.
JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said the store wins create a significant new presence for WH Smith within the UK tech accessories travel market, which could result in further opportunities for the company to expand InMotion in the country and across Europe. 
The brokerage also noted that all but one of the 18 stores were stores of Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) Plc, which in April decided to shut its airport stores business, after a scheme allowing VAT-free shopping for overseas tourists was scrapped. 
WH Smith said on Thursday it continued to be impacted by the slowdown in its travel business, but was seeing an ""encouraging recovery"" in North America, where June sales recovered to about 88% of 2019 levels.
Overall, revenue at its travel business, which includes its airport and train station shops and kiosks, recovered to 48% of 2019 levels in the 18 weeks to July 3, up from 34% in its second quarter. 
The two-century-old company also said high-street revenue recovered to 86% of 2019 levels in the 18 weeks to July 3, but footfall continued to be below pre-pandemic levels. 
WH Smith, hit hard by the pandemic due to travel curbs and work-from-home mandates, warned in April of the possible risk of breaching its covenant tests in 2022 after posting a first-half loss.
It said on Thursday its liquidity position was strong and it would continue to focus on reducing cash burn, which amounted to about 2 million pounds per month over the March to June period.

(Reuters) - British gambling firm Entain is doubling investment in its game development studios, as it steps up its focus on online betting after closing hundreds of high street betting shops.
Entain, which owns brands including  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL), bwin and Coral, will announce the moves later on Thursday including a doubling of the workforce at its in-house studios in the United Kingdom, Italy and India to around 300.
Newly appointed Chief Executive Jette Nygaard-Andersen said original online content would form a pivotal part of her strategy for the company, likening its efforts to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s pursuit of original programming to woo subscribers.
""We want to give customers an expanded choice in the markets we're already in and add new experiences to reach out to new customers,"" she told Reuters.
The closure of hundreds of Ladbrokes' retail stores, for decades a familiar part of British high streets, is symbolic of the industry's steady shift to online which 18 months of lockdowns has deepened.
Entain, which added 4 million online customers last year, is also moving on from the collapse earlier this year of a buyout by U.S. casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International after the two sides differed on valuations. 
The FTSE-100 firm did not disclose how much it was investing but said the new content would include free-to-play slots tournaments and a sports-themed virtual reality product set to launch later this year.

Entain is also looking to develop gambling products for e-sports fans, many of whom are millennials, as well as looking at other new markets, Nygaard-Andersen said.
""We're looking at around 50 markets which are becoming fully regulated which we could move into, on top of those we're in now,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co may build a battery cell plant in the United States to support the auto industry's shift to electrification, a company source with close knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), has been in talks with automakers including Stellantis, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Motor-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian to supply batteries manufactured at its potential U.S. factory, the source said. 
The South Korean battery maker is considering investing at least 3 trillion won ($2.62 billion) to manufacture batteries for Stellantis and a minimum of 1 trillion won for batteries to Rivian, according to the source. 
The source added that Samsung SDI has not yet decided whether they would launch the U.S. plant as a joint venture with carmakers, or as an independent manufacturing site. 
The source said the decision to build in the U.S. reflects the changes on tariff rules in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that took effect last year, replacing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The USMCA requires that vehicles have 75% North American content compared with a 62.5% threshold under NAFTA in order to avoid tariffs.
""We have been reviewing our expansion in the United States, but nothing has been decided yet,"" a Samsung SDI spokesperson said, adding that the company cannot disclose details of talks with customers. 
Samsung SDI has EV battery plants in South Korea, China and Hungary, which supply customers such as BMW, Ford, Volvo and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
Samsung SDI's domestic rivals LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation Co Ltd have announced separate plans to manufacture EV battery cells in the U.S.
Formed in January by the merger of Italian-American group Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, Stellantis has battery plant projects in France and in Germany, both in a joint venture with a subsidiary of TotalEnergies. 
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Stellantis is making progress on finalising a deal to build a battery plant in Italy. 
The carmaker has said it would take a decision on additional battery factories in Europe and in the U.S. this year.

In April, Rivian said Samsung SDI would supply battery cells for its vehicles.

The Rome-based FAO also said in a statement that worldwide cereal harvests would come in at nearly 2.817 billion tonnes in 2021, slightly down on its previous estimate, but still on course to hit an annual record.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 124.6 points last month versus a revised 127.8 in May.
The May figure was previously given as 127.1.
On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 33.9% in June.
FAO's vegetable oil price index plunged 9.8% in June, partly on the back of a fall in palm oil prices, which were hit by expectations of output gains in leading producers and a lack of fresh import demand. Soy and sunflower oil quotations also dropped.
The cereal price index dropped 2.6% in June month-on-month, but was still up 33.8% year-on-year. Maize prices fell 5.0%, partly because of higher-than-expected yields in Argentina and improved crop conditions in the United States.
International rice prices also fell in June, touching 15-month lows, as high freight costs and container shortages continued to limit export sales, FAO said.
Dairy prices dipped 1.0% on a monthly basis, with all components of the index easing. Butter recorded the largest drop, hit by a rapid decline in global import demand and a slight increase in inventories, especially in Europe.
The sugar index posted a 0.9% month-on-month gain, reaching its highest level since March 2017. FAO said uncertainties over the impact of unfavourable weather conditions on crop yields in Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter, pushed prices up. 
The meat index rose 2.1% from May, with quotations for all meat types rising as increases in imports by some East Asian countries compensated for a slowdown in China's meat purchases.
FAO said the slight fall in its estimate for world cereal production this year was principally triggered by a sharp cut to the Brazilian maize production forecast as prolonged periods of dry weather weighed on yield expectations.
Global wheat production prospects also retreated this month, as dry weather in the Near East hurt yield prospects there. By contrast, the forecast for global rice output in 2021 edged up. 

The forecast for world cereal utilization in 2021/22 was cut by 15 million tonnes from the previous month to 2.810 billion tonnes, still 1.5% higher than in 2020/21.
World cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021/22 are now expected to rise above their opening levels for the first time since 2017/18. ""Higher maize stocks foreseen in China account for the bulk of this month's upward revision to world cereal inventories,"" FAO said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Cairn Energy said on Thursday a Paris court had accepted its petition that Indian state-owned assets in the city worth over 20 million euros ($24 million) be frozen, claiming a significant win in its campaign to force the Indian government to pay Cairn billion-dollar damages in a protracted tax dispute.
A French tribunal ordered the freeze on some 20 centrally located properties belonging to the Indian government as part of a guarantee of the amount owed to Cairn, the London-listed firm said.
Cairn said it has also registered similar claims against India in courts in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Singapore and Quebec. 
India's government said in a statement on Thursday it had not received any communication on the issue from any French court, and that it would ""take appropriate legal remedies"" once it received any notice.
""This is the necessary preparatory step to taking ownership of the properties and ensures that the proceeds of any sales would be due to Cairn,"" the firm said. 
Cairn, which has oil and gas operations in India, was awarded damages of more than $1.2 billion, plus interest and costs, in December by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague in a long drawn-out tussle with the Indian government over certain retrospective tax claims. Cairn says it is now owed $1.7 billion in total.
While New Delhi has filed an appeal against the damages ruling, Cairn has identified Indian assets overseas, including assets of national carrier Air India that the energy firm says could be seized in the absence of a settlement.
""Our strong preference remains an agreed, amicable settlement with the government of India to draw this matter to a close,"" the company said.
In its statement on Thursday the government said it will ""vigorously defend its case"".
It also said the chief executive and representatives of Cairn have approached the government for discussions to resolve the matter. ""Constructive discussions have been held and the government remains open for an amicable solution to the dispute within the country's legal framework,"" it said.
The dispute began in 2012 after a previous Indian government decided to impose capital gains tax retrospectively on some companies, such as telecoms operator Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Plc, which also took its case to arbitration and won. 
The cases spooked foreign investors, and also dealt a blow to the government of Manmohan Singh, who lost power in a 2014 election to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Modi's government has said it would not make retrospective tax claims in future but has defended outstanding cases.

Shares in the FTSE 100 listed group, which sells everything from food to homewares, do-it-yourself and gardening products, were down 2.7% on Thursday after it said like-for-like revenue at its B&M UK business fell 4.4% in the 13 weeks to June 26, its fiscal first quarter.
That compared with growth of 24.5% in the second half of its 2020-21 year.
However, comparing the period to the first quarter two years ago, before the pandemic impacted trading, like-for-like revenue was up 21.3%.
""As expected, trading throughout the first quarter was volatile as we annualised against the high comparatives from last year,"" said CEO Simon Arora.
The group, whose full name is B&M European Value Retail, has performed well during the pandemic. Its stores were allowed to stay open through multiple UK lockdowns because they sell some food, and its low prices and out-of-town locations chimed with consumers.
B&M said a pull-forward in gardening demand boosted revenue in the final two weeks of the 2020-21 year and early weeks of 2021-22, and depressed the subsequent weeks.
It said overall group revenue in the quarter rose 3.1% on a constant currency basis to 1.19 billion pounds ($1.64 billion).
The group also trades as Heron Foods in the UK and has a business in France. It has a total of 1,097 stores.
B&M said that while it was too early to predict likely revenue and profit outcomes for 2021-22, it was on track with its plans for the year and expected the two-year like-for-like measure in the core B&M UK business to remain strong.
Analysts are on average forecasting group core earnings (EBITDA) for 2021-22 of 666.5 million pounds, according to Refinitiv data, up from 626 million pounds in 2020-21.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Thursday ahead of the publication of the ECB’s strategy review, handing back some of the previous session’s gains after a weak lead from Asia.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.4%.
Stock markets have generally posted strong gains this year. However, sentiment could be changing amid worries of a Chinese regulatory clampdown on tech stocks, rising Covid-19 virus cases and fretting that central banks, and the Federal Reserve in particular, could be close to tightening monetary policy.
The DAX closed 1.2% higher Wednesday, the CAC 40 gained 0.3% and the FTSE 100 ended up 0.7% after the release of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting minutes.
They stated that more evidence of a robust economic recovery would be needed to set a timeline for asset tapering, but they also made clear that some FOMC members think that could come sooner than previously expected.
Sticking with central banks, the European Central Bank is set to announce the outcome of a 18-month strategy review at 1100 GMT, followed by a news conference hosted by President Christine Lagarde at 1230 GMT. 
The central bank is expected to raise its inflation goal to 2%, a more explicit target than the previously used phrase, “below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”, as well as describing the target as symmetric. 
In corporate news,  TeamViewer  (DE:TMV) stock fell 13%, to a 52-week low, after the software specialist reported weaker-than-expected billings growth in the second quarter.

Deliveroo (LON:ROO) stock rose 4.9% after the food delivery company raised its full-year guidance following strong growth in the first half of the year, while  Danske Bank  (CSE:DANSKE) stock rose 3% after the Copenhagen-based bank raised its full-year outlook.
Wise stock fell 1.1% with the financial technology company handing back some of the 10% gains it profited from on its first day of trading after its direct listing debut. Elsewhere,  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE), Europe's largest renewable energy provider, fell 4.5% as a corruption case rumbled on.
The data slate centers around the weekly U.S. unemployment figures later in the session, with initial jobless claims seen falling to 350,000 last week, from 364,000 the previous week.
Elsewhere, oil prices dropped Thursday, falling for the third consecutive session, amid continued uncertainty over future OPEC+ production levels after a dispute halted talks earlier this week.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, had been expected to boost production to balance the market given growing demand before a spat between senior members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Evidence of the improving demand in the U.S. came late Wednesday with the American Petroleum Institute reporting a reduction of almost 8 million barrels from stockpiles last week, largely matching the 8.2 million-barrel draw recorded during the previous week.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later in the day.

The state-run lender is eyeing a bond issuance in the third quarter with an estimated coupon rate of 4% to 5% per year and a maturity of up to 5 1/2 years, according to a document presented by Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, a deputy minister at the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry (SOEs), at a parliament hearing.
The lender also plans to launch a rights issuance in the first half of 2022 with the government aiming to maintain its majority stake of between 55% to 57% by injecting 7 trillion rupiah, Kartika told the lawmakers.
The proceeds will be used to support the bank's capital.
Kartika said the lender's assets and loan growth for the past few years had not been supported by adequate profits. Its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) has dropped as low as 16%.
""As a systemic bank, we hope (BNI's) CAR can return to around 19%,"" Kartika said.
BNI's profits dropped 43.9% year-on-year in the January-March period to 2.4 trillion rupiah.

Kartika said another state lender, Bank Tabungan Negara, also planned to raise capital from a rights issue of up to 5 trillion rupiah. He did not give a timeline.

BPCE said plans to diversify Natixis' business lines should result in around 500 million euros ($590 million) of additional revenues for Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking in 2024.
It would also put environmental, social and governance (ESG) work at the centre of its asset management and insurance arms, targeting more than 600 billion euros in assets under management in the sustainable or impact investing category for Natixis Investment Managers, representing 50% of total assets under management by 2024.
BPCE, which runs France's second-biggest retail bank network behind market leader Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), said its plans should bring in extra revenues of 1.5 billion euros in priority areas such as fund management, investment banking, insurance and payments solutions.

""At the end of this plan, we will not only have conquered new territories by supporting the economic recovery and the realization of our customers' projects but we will also have established Groupe BPCE as a front-ranking player in banking, insurance and asset management,"" said Chairman Laurent Mignon.

Like-for-like sales at venues directly managed by the company were at 76% of pre-pandemic levels for the 12 weeks to July 3, Fuller's said, pointing to an improvement in net debt levels after the easing of some restrictions.
""The boom in staycations and desire to get back out with friends has led to strong trading in parts of our estate - particularly Cotswold Inns & Hotels and our rural pubs with rooms,"" Chief Executive Officer Simon Emeny said. 
The largely family owned business has had to cut jobs, sell some businesses, raise funds and seek loan waivers during the pandemic as social distancing measures and curfews shutdown its operations and hammered the hospitality sector.
Fuller's said adjusted pretax loss stood at 48.7 million pounds ($67.14 million) for the 52 weeks to March 27, compared to a profit of 19.4 million pounds in the previous year. Overall sales and other income slumped 77%.

Jet2, which sells package holidays and flights to European leisure destinations, said that its liquidity remained strong at 1.46 billion pounds, despite losses arising from the crisis and the refunds it had to make when its aircraft were grounded. 
For the current financial year, the company said its performance would depend on the level of flying permitted over the rest of summer and in its winter period, over which it currently has limited visibility. 
That may have changed by later on Thursday. British transport minister Grant Shapps is expected to set out details of a plan to allow fully vaccinated Britons to return to England without quarantining, opening up travel for millions.

Looking to next summer, Jet2 said it was optimistic that 2022 would be a ""considerable improvement"" on the previous two years, with bookings already showing a higher proportion of higher margin package holidays in the mix.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 02:26AM ET</span>",Europe's SoftBank Prosus plays long game to shrink value gap,"By Toby Sterling, Promit Mukherjee and Abhinav Ramnarayan
AMSTERDAM/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -Prosus, Europe's answer to SoftBank and its Vision Fund, is betting that its long-term investments can fill a yawning valuation gap and give it the same name recognition as one of the world's most aggressive technology investors.
Based in the Netherlands, Prosus (OTC:PROSF) was spun out of South Africa's Naspers in 2019 with a mandate to manage the spoils of a $32 million bet on China's Tencent, now worth $200 billion, on a 30-year investment horizon.
Japanese giant SoftBank's own firepower is backstopped by its stake in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which has its origins in CEO Masayoshi Son's $20 million investment in the Chinese e-commerce firm.
A banker who has worked with both Prosus and Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) describes them as ""the two global elephants out there with massive permanent capital"" for tech investments, and the rivals are also sometimes co-investors.
In an indication of its ambition, Prosus last month hired Ervin Tu, a managing partner at Vision Fund and a former technology banker at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to head its group M&A.
Jean Pierre Verster, CEO of South African investment manager Protea, which holds almost 10% of its fund assets in Prosus, says Tu's appointment ""tells you that there's probably going to be more (M&A) activity coming down the line"".
That is already evident as since April, Prosus has made a dozen investments, last month announcing the $1.8 billion acquisition of software developer platform Stack Overflow.
""We have significant capacity on the balance sheet, and we also see really good opportunities in the segments we operate today,"" Chief Executive Bob van Dijk told Reuters, adding that while Prosus at times competed with SoftBank there were significant differences between the two investors.
Verster sees the Stack Overflow acquisition as a sign that Prosus may ""get a bit more aggressive"", although he expects the group, which owns a mix of controlling and minority stakes in many tech firms, will remain more conservative than Softbank.
MIND THE GAP
Prosus has not had easy ride in its first few years, with a complicated structure and operating losses at most investments it has made, apart from Tencent, leading it to trade at a deep discount to the value of its assets.
Its stock market valuation is 25% lower than the market value of the 28.9% stake in Tencent it currently holds. At Naspers, which in turn controls Prosus, the discount to its economic interest in Tencent is more than 40%.
(For an interactive graphic, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/3hD4Ukk)
Bob van Dijk, who also heads Naspers, says this discount is transitory and investors have done well so far and will continue to in the long term. 
""You just need to look through (the losses) and the potential and the strength of the business model is much more important than short-term profitability,"" he said.
One way of narrowing the gap is by gradually offloading the crown jewels, and Prosus raised $15 billion by selling a 2% stake in WeChat owner Tencent in April. 
A third of that will go to share buybacks once a cross-holding structure with Naspers, has been set up. Prosus shareholders are set to approve the deal on Friday.
Prosus says the real solution to the valuation gap is finding more new investments and improving profitability at the old ones until they rival or even eclipse the Tencent holding.
And that is why the remaining $10 billion from its most recent stake sale is being ploughed back into broadening the Prosus portfolio, which spans online classified firms, fintech, educational software and online food ordering and delivery.
NO END GAME 
Finding the next Tencent among tens of thousands of technology start-ups around the globe is the challenge facing Van Dijk and his new SoftBank hire Tu.
Prosus invests in only one out of every 200 or 300 opportunities it reviews, Van Dijk said, in the range of sectors it knows well. The more mature portfolio ranges from U.S.-based Codecademy, to Indian food deliverer Swiggy, to Russia's Mail.Ru to global marketplace operator OLX.
Early stage investments are generated by a two-dozen person venture arm, where Banafsheh Fathieh is head of Americas. Investments of more than $200 million go through the Prosus board.
Fathieh, who works out of a small office in San Francisco, says her portfolio is a far cry from the Silicon Valley bubble.
""We are a different brand of venture capital. If you're taking a 30 year point of view, you can go after entrepreneurs that have lifelong dreams to build companies that will last,"" she said in an interview.
Fathieh said that what makes Prosus/Naspers unique is its willingness to invest in entrepreneurs and businesses it believes in, without the 3-7 year ""exit plan"" that frames most venture capital and private equity investments.
At Prosus/Naspers, Fathieh said, ""there is no end game"".
FOOD FOR THOUGHT
Food ordering and delivery is an industry where Prosus is clearly hungry for more. Its initial 2017 investments in Delivery Hero have tripled in value and in March it paid 2.2 billion euros to increase its stake in the German firm.
One target is iFood of Brazil, a company that delivered 500 million meals last year. Prosus owns a two-thirds stake, and co-owner Just Eat Takeaway.com is looking to divest the other third for more than $2 billion.
Such investments are delivering growth and for the year ended March 31, Prosus reported revenue at its non-Tencent ecommerce businesses grew by 46% to $6.2 billion. 
Although trading losses were $429 million, Prosus' net profit including Tencent nearly doubled to $7.45 billion, underlining how much the stake still dominates results.
""If they grow at say, 30% per year ... I am happy,"" Protea's Verster said. ""Any narrowing of the discount is just a bonus.""

Analyst Ken Rumph of Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), who rates Prosus shares a hold, says the market discount may persist after the cross-holding structure is in place as ""investors are put off by the same issues they had with Naspers,"" including a complicated control structure.
And the Tencent stake will long outshine other management actions, Rumph said, adding: ""Even a continued 20% return on investments elsewhere in the portfolio will take years to shift the balance away from Tencent"".

Suedzucker said group operating profit dropped 20.1% on-year to 49 million euros ($58 million) in the first quarter ended May 31.
The company confirmed it still expects full-year group operating profit of 300 million to 400 million euros, up from 236 million euros last year. 
The company had made a limited advanced announcement of its earnings last month.
Its full-year operating profit is forecast at between breakeven and 100 million euros. 
""We expect an improvement in the EU sugar market from October 2021 and also expect to achieve higher sugar sales prices in the second half of the business year,"" a Suedzucker spokesperson told Reuters.
""The EU is expected to remain a net sugar importer with the overall European sugar supply picture looking tight. With world sugar prices likely to firm, this should also mean higher EU sugar prices in coming months.""
Raw sugar futures this week hovered around four-month highs as crop damage in top producer Brazil after frost was assessed. 
""We have slightly expanded our sugar beet area for the new harvest,"" the spokesperson added. ""We are also hoping that the general economic framework will improve with the impact of COVID-19 declining as more people are vaccinated."" 

Suedzucker's 2021 sugar beet plantings are up 3.1% at 353,600 hectares.
The company's first-quarter numbers were dented by operating losses of 25 million euros in the sugar sector, wider from an operating loss of 16 million euros a year earlier.

Billings growth, the German company's preferred top-line metric, grew around 15% in the second quarter on a reported basis and by 18% at constant currencies, below its projections of at least 20% growth.
Teamviewer released results ahead of schedule, as is required under German stock exchange rules when they diverge materially from company guidance or market expectations.
The company, headquartered in Goeppingen, had profited from a surge in new business early in the COVID-19 pandemic, as government lockdowns sparked a rapid shift to home working.
""While the company retained most of the new subscribers from the first wave of the 2020 lockdown, those renewal values in April and May were lower than initially anticipated,"" Teamviewer said in a statement.
""In June, trading momentum improved significantly, driven by a rebound of renewal values and a very strong enterprise pipeline conversion.""
Teamviewer confirmed its 2021 outlook, albeit towards the lower end of the expected range for billings of 585-605 million euros ($690-$714 million). It still projects an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 49% and 51% for the year.
The company had cut its margin guidance in March, as it entered into major sponsorship deals with English Premier League club Manchester United, and motor racing teams Mercedes Formula One and Formula E.

Shares in the company, which floated on the Frankfurt stock exchange in September 2019, are down 26% in the year to date.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Thursday ahead of the publication of the ECB’s strategy review, handing back some of the previous session’s gains after a weak lead from Asia.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%. 
Stock markets in Asia were mostly lower Thursday, weighed by an extended selloff in tech shares over worries of a Chinese regulatory clampdown as well as rising Covid-19 virus cases.
This negative tone is expected to weigh on the European markets at the start of trading, even after Wednesday’s healthy gains. The DAX closed 1.2% higher, the CAC 40 gained 0.3% and the FTSE 100 ended up 0.7% after the Federal Reserve said in its latest policy meeting minutes that more evidence of a robust economic recovery would be needed to set a timeline for asset tapering.
Back in Europe, the European Central Bank is set to announce the outcome of a 18-month strategy review at 1100 GMT, followed by a news conference hosted by President Christine Lagarde at 1230 GMT. 
The central bank is expected to raise its inflation goal to 2%, a more explicit target than the previously used phrase, “below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”, as well as describing the target as symmetric. 
The data slate in Europe includes German trade numbers, but the weekly U.S. unemployment figures will probably be the economic highlight. Initial jobless claims are seen falling to 350,000 last week, from 364,000 the previous week.
In corporate news,  Suedzucker  (DE:SZUG), Europe's largest sugar producer, reported disappointing first-quarter earnings on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but expected profits to rise in its full financial year.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower, falling for the third consecutive session, amid continued uncertainty over future OPEC+ production levels after a dispute halted talks earlier this week.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, had been expected to boost production to balance the market given growing demand before a spat between senior members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Evidence of the improving demand in the U.S. came late Wednesday with the American Petroleum Institute reporting a reduction of almost 8 million barrels from stockpiles last week, largely matching the 8.2 million-barrel draw recorded during the previous week.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later in the day.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $72.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $73.29.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,798.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1801.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 01:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-U.S. IPO market a danger zone for Chinese firms after Beijing crackdown,"By Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Echo Wang
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -China's stepped-up scrutiny of overseas listings by its companies and a clampdown on ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc soon after its debut in New York have darkened the outlook for listings in the United States, bankers and investors said. 
On Tuesday Beijing said it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore and tighten rules for cross-border data flows, a sweeping regulatory shift that is also set to weigh on the long-term valuations of the IPO-bound companies, they said.
Bankers and investors expect the pace of activity to slow in the near-term as investors grapple with Beijing's decision to tighten supervision of firms listed offshore, coming just days after regulators stunned investors by launching a cybersecurity investigation into Didi.
""It suffices to say those Chinese companies already planning to list in the U.S. will have to pause, or even abandon the plans altogether, in the face of mounting uncertainties and confusions,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital Group.
""The U.S. market is off limits, at least for now,"" said Hu, whose private equity firm's portfolio include a number of tech companies that have gone public overseas. ""...The stakes are extraordinarily high, for both the tech companies and for China as a country.""
U.S. capital markets have been a lucrative source of funding for Chinese firms in the past decade, especially for technology companies looking to benchmark their valuations against listed peers there and tap an abundant liquidity pool. 
A record $12.5 billion has been raised so far in 2021 in 34 offerings from listings of Chinese firms in the U.S., Refinitiv data shows, well up from the $1.9 billion worth of new listings in 14 deals in the year-ago period.
Analysts say China's moves to look more closely at firms venturing overseas add a new layer of uncertainty for firms already struggling to navigate escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over a broad range of issues. 
""The message is that for a successful overseas listing, Chinese regulators must be involved, as well as international cooperation with overseas regulatory bodies,"" said Louis Lau, California-based Brandes Investment Partners' director of investments.
""Overseas-listed Chinese companies may have had the mistaken impression that it can ignore Chinese regulators just because they are not listed in China,"" Lau, whose company holds Chinese stocks, told Reuters.
The broader regulatory clampdown and Didi's listing dustup drove the S&P/BNY Mellon China Select ADR Index, which tracks the American depositary receipts of major U.S.-listed Chinese companies, down 3.4% on Tuesday.
'CLEAR SIGNAL'
Catching many investors, and Didi, off-guard, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Sunday ordered the ride-hailing firm to remove its apps from app stores in China for illegally collecting users' personal data, less than a week after it made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange following its $4.4 billion initial public offering. 
It was the largest Chinese IPO in the U.S. since e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group raised $25 billion in 2014.
For investors, the euphoria was shortlived, with Didi's shares diving nearly a third since its debut on June 30. The stock fell for third consecutive session on Wednesday, ending down 4.6%. 
The CAC also announced probes into Kanzhun Ltd's online recruiting app Zhipin and truck hailing company Full Truck Alliance. 
""It's a clear signal that the Chinese government is not particularly happy that these firms continue to decide to raise capital in the west,"" said Jordan Schneider, a technology analyst at research firm Rhodium Group.
The measures come as the U.S. securities regulator in March began rolling out new regulations that could see Chinese companies delisted if they do not comply with U.S. auditing rules.
BOOST FOR HONG KONG
While the latest crackdown has dimmed the outlook for large Chinese IPOs in New York, not all companies are rushing to pull their ongoing offerings just yet. 
LinkDoc Technology Ltd, which is described as a Chinese medical data solutions provider, is currently raising up to $211 million in a U.S. IPO and is due to price its shares after the U.S. market closes Thursday.
There has been no change to that time table yet, according to two sources with direct knowledge.
LinkDoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wall Street banks, which have benefited from Chinese firms' rush to list in New York in recent years, are also expected to take a hit on their fee income in the near-term, according to bankers.
Investment banking fees from Chinese offerings were worth $485.8 million so far in 2021, Refinitiv data shows. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are at the top of the league table for deal volume, according to the data.
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment, while Morgan Stanley did not respond.
Some bankers said the latest regulatory clampdown will further boost Hong Kong's allure as a fundraising venue for Chinese companies looking to avoid the new restrictions for listing in the United States. 

Underscoring that optimism, shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) rose as much as 6.2% on Wednesday, and was the second most actively traded stock by turnover.
""Buying is fueled by an expectation that HKEX may become the only IPO center for Chinese firms seeking listing and the main center for raising foreign capital,"" said Steven Leung, sales director at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chair of embattled Crown Resorts Ltd said she had challenged the Australian casino operator's ""resistant"" approach to a public inquiry that found it unsuitable for a gambling licence in Sydney, but that she was ""overruled"" by the board.
Helen Coonan, who became chair in January 2020, said she had also called for Crown's CEO to be removed after his testimony last year at the public inquiry but the legal advice was that it ""wouldn't be a very sensible thing to do"".
The inquiry by New South Wales (NSW) state ultimately found Crown unsuitable for a gambling licence at its new A$2.2 billion resort in capital Sydney, citing links to money launderers, indifference to staff safety and billionaire shareholder James Packer's untoward influence over the board.
The NSW inquiry triggered Royal Commissions - Australia's most powerful type of public hearing - in two other states Victoria and Western Australia with operational Crown casinos, potentially jeopardising its main revenue source.
Coonan latest remarks, made on Thursday at Victoria's Royal Commission into the suitability of Crown to hold a licence in Melbourne, reveals a divide on the board of the A$7.7 billion company on the level of cooperation with the 2020 NSW hearing.
""I became increasingly concerned about the strategy then as the evidence began to unfold, and I thought we needed to take a very different approach,"" Coonan told the commission.
""I was overruled of course,"" added Coonan, a former federal communications minister. ""You still need to have numbers on a board, even if you're the chair.""
Coonan also said she and the board were following legal advice with respect to their strategy at the NSW inquiry.
After Packer, who has a 37% stake in Crown, and high-ranking personnel of the casino operator testified through 2020, Coonan said she recommended that the CEO at the time, Ken Barton, leave to demonstrate the company's commitment to changing culture.
""The legal advice was that that wouldn't be a very sensible thing to do for the overall strategy, which would be Mr Barton rolling out reforms,"" she said.

Barton ultimately stepped down as CEO in February, along with numerous directors, after the inquiry singled him out for criticism in its final report.
The Royal Commissions in Victoria and Western Australia continue.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cash-rich Singapore Airlines aims for regional dominance as rivals pull back,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd (SIA), flush with $16 billion raised since the start of the pandemic thanks to help from a state investor, is in a position of dominance among its Southeast Asian rivals as they downsize and restructure.
The crisis threatened the survival of hub carriers that lack domestic markets such as SIA, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd and Dubai's Emirates. Indeed, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last year said the government would ""spare no effort"" to ensure SIA made it through the pandemic.
Its majority shareholder, government-owned investment arm Temasek Holdings underwrote one of the world's biggest airline rescue packages. Thanks to that, SIA's has enough funds to keep going for at least two more years without cuts, and is modernising its fleet to save fuel, reduce maintenance costs and meet environmental goals while other airlines shed aircraft. 
""The crisis shows the importance of having a cash-rich state investor as its main backer,"" said a banker, who was not authorised to speak with media and spoke anonymously.
SIA's cash pile is the envy of rivals like Thai Airways and Garuda Indonesia, which have received little government support. Many of SIA's rivals are trimming fleets to a level that could ultimately weaken their hubs and send more connecting traffic to Singapore.
""Basically what these airlines are trying to do is they are trying to ward off their debtors,"" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. 
SIA, meanwhile, is improving its fleet and bolstering its budget carrier, Scoot. In Europe and North America, leisure travel has led a recovery; if that holds true in Asia, budget carriers will be crucial for airlines.
Having culled older planes and cut 20% of staff last year, SIA is under less immediate pressure for more downsizing. CEO Goh Choon Phong in May described last year's job cuts as a ""very painful process"" and said there were no plans for more.
But analysts say it could take 12 to 18 months for widespread travel to resume in Asia.
""They can survive for two or three years without making any money,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said. ""But at a certain stage you say, 'is it really worth it? Shouldn't you take tough steps?'""
Less than 9% of rights sold in SIA's recent S$6.2 billion convertible bond issue went to shareholders other than Temasek, showing the state investor is more patient than others about achieving returns. 
Bumpy ride for Southeast Asia's national carriers https://graphics.reuters.com/SINGAPOREAIR-STRATEGY/azgpoqrqlpd/index.html 
MODERN FLEET
SIA deferred S$4 billion of spending on new planes over three years after reaching agreements with manufacturers Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
But because of large pre-crisis orders, it is still spending S$3.7 billion on new aircraft and adding at least 19 planes to its fleet this year, including 13 widebodies, despite little demand. 
By contrast, Germany's larger Lufthansa, which earned nearly four times as much revenue annually pre-COVID, has a capital spending budget of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.77 billion) for 2021.
SIA's financial cushioning makes it harder to push back on contracts with manufacturers and lessors. Temasek supports fleet modernisation.
BUDGET ADVANTAGE
With travel in a holding pattern and rivals distracted by financial issues, Scoot has been using some of SIA's cash to boost staff training and invest in new software that helps it calculate more profitable fares for connecting flights. 
""There has been a lot of investment, which is certainly geared toward a future recovery,"" Scoot CEO Campbell Wilson said. ""Those investments I hope will pay off as time passes.""
Thai Airways lost significant market share to budget rivals in the decade before the pandemic, contributing to years of losses, and has yet to formulate a fresh low-cost strategy as part of a restructuring involving $12.9 billion of debt. 
Garuda, Malaysia Airlines and Philippine Airlines are in similar positions, either having completed or about to launch major restructurings. They lost money for years before the pandemic.
""Presumably in shedding their liabilities they will create some unhappy people who were owed money that was never paid,"" Wilson said. ""The extent to which that subsequently constrains them, time will tell.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Thursday morning. U.S. shares and Treasuries gained after the U.S. Federal Reserve said in its latest policy meeting minutes that more evidence of a robust economic recovery from COVID-19 would be needed to set an asset tapering timeline.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.70% by 10:39 PM ET (2:39 AM GMT), ahead of a decision on declaring a fresh state of emergency in the country due later in the day. Japanese economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told an advisory panel on Thursday that the move, covering Tokyo, would be in place from Jul. 12 to Aug. 22.
The proposed period also covers the entire duration of the Tokyo Olympic Games. A decision in favor of the state of emergency could see spectators banned from the games, which are due to open in less than three weeks.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.72%. The country reported 1,275 daily COVID-19 cases as of Jul. 8, with the number exceeding the record set in December 2020.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.28% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.92%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.55% while the Shenzhen Component was gained 0.52%, with the consumer price index and producer price index due to be released on Friday. Also on investors’ radar is a State Council hint that the People's Bank of China could cut its reserve requirement ratio for banks to give the economy a boost.
U.S. shares closed at all-time highs, while benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields steadied around 1.31%, after falling for seven trading days, as inflation expectations continue to decrease.
The minutes from the Fed’s June meeting, released on Wednesday, did not provide the hoped-for clues to the central bank’s asset tapering schedule.
The Fed took markets by surprise with its hawkish tone when it handed down its latest policy decision in June. Although ongoing uncertainty about the economic recovery made officials reluctant to communicate this schedule, they wanted to be prepared should asset tapering be needed sooner than expected.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank will release the outcome of an 18-month strategy review later in the day, in which it will reportedly raise its inflation goal to 2% and allow room for any required overshoot. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20, or G20, will also meet in Venice on Friday.
Some investors remain optimistic, however.
“I think the Goldilocks scenario will last for quite a while... we are at a point where the central banks all over the world have very much a desire to keep interest rates low and fortunately, we have not seen any long-term significant signs of inflation,” Dalton Investments chair Belita Ong told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 deaths passed the four million mark as of Jul. 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

Macquarie has been speaking with potential partners, including local pension funds, about making a joint offer for the airport, the report said, citing unidentified sources.
The report sent Sydney Airport's shares up as much as 3.6% to A$7.88, as of 0139 GMT. The stock, however, still traded 37 cents lower than the A$8.25 apiece offered by a consortium of infrastructure investors on Monday, suggesting market uncertainty over deal.
The consortium of infrastructure investors - investment manager IFM Investors, superannuation fund QSuper, and fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners - offered to buy Australia's biggest airport at a 42% premium to the stock's Friday close.
Talks were at an early stage and Macquarie could also seek to join the IFM consortium, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
Macquarie and Sydney Airport did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment.

IFM holds stakes in major airports in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. QSuper holds a stake in Britain's Heathrow Airport, while Global Infrastructure is invested in the country's Gatwick and London City airports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday filed lawsuits against  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, as well as their chief executives, alleging they unlawfully silence conservative viewpoints.
The lawsuits, filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, allege the California-based social media platforms violated the right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
Trump is seeking class action status for the lawsuits, meaning he would represent the interests of other users of Twitter, Facebook, and Google's YouTube who allege they have been unfairly silenced. 
He filed three lawsuits making similar allegations — one against Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one against Twitter and its CEO Jack Dorsey, and one against Google and its CEO Sundar Pichai.
""We will achieve a historic victory for American freedom and at the same time, freedom of speech,"" Trump said at a news conference at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.
A Twitter representative declined to comment. Representatives of Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump lost his social media megaphone this year after the companies said he violated their policies against glorifying violence. Hundreds of his supporters launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 after a Trump speech repeating his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration. 
The lawsuits ask a judge to invalidate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that has been called the backbone of the internet because it provides websites with protections from liability over content posted by users. Trump and others who have attacked Section 230 say it has given big internet companies too much legal protection and allowed them to escape responsibility for their actions.
""This complaint is hard to even make sense of,"" said Paul Gowder, a professor of law at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University.
Trump sought to portray the social media companies as subject to the same First Amendment requirements as government entities when it comes to censorship, but Gowder said nothing in the lawsuits ""even comes close to turning social media companies into government actors.""

A federal judge in Florida last week blocked https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-judge-rules-florida-social-media-law-likely-violates-free-speech-2021-07-01 a recently enacted state law that was meant to authorize the state to penalize social media companies when they ban political candidates, with the judge saying the law likely violated free speech rights.
The lawsuit said the bill signed by Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis in May was unconstitutional. It would have made Florida the first state to regulate how social media companies moderate online speech.

In June, Boring Company opened its first commercial tunnel project in Las Vegas to transport visitors through the city's Convention Center using human-driven Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. 
Boring Company said the 1.7-mile (2.7 kilometer) tunnel reduces ""a 45 minute cross-campus walk time to approximately 2 minutes"" at the facility.

Musk, who leads electric-car maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, launched the Boring Company after complaining on Twitter in December 2016 that L.A.’s traffic was “driving me nuts,” promising to “build a boring machine and just start digging.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Wednesday and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record closing highs after minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting indicated officials may not be ready yet to move on tightening policy.
According to the minutes of the U.S. central bank's June policy meeting, Fed officials felt substantial further progress on the economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" but agreed they should be poised to act if inflation or other risks materialized.
""I read this as effectively a dovish set of notes simply because they don't feel as a group that they have enough certainty around the situation to make any changes at all,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Treasury yields edged lower following the Fed minutes, while stocks mostly edged higher.
The minutes reflected a divided Fed wrestling with new inflation risks but still relatively high unemployment.
After its meeting and statement last month, investors began to anticipate the Fed would move more quickly to tighten than previously expected.
Wall Street has been concerned about inflation, with investors moving between economy-linked value stocks and growth names in the past few sessions.
Both growth and value stocks gained on Wednesday, while industrials and materials led S&P 500 sector gains.

The contingency plan for one of the world's largest philanthropic foundations was announced https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/gates-foundation-trustees-commitment?utm_source=GF&utm_medium=TW&sf147211473=1 by Chief Executive Officer Mark Suzman, a move that would ensure a successful transition for the foundation that has spent over $50 billion in the past two decades toward combating poverty and disease.
If Melinda resigns after two years, she would receive personal resources from Bill for her philanthropic work, which would be completely separate from the foundation's endowment, the foundation said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Bill will then assume the full stewardship of the foundation, which the couple had often referred to as their ""fourth child"".
Melinda and Bill in May filed for divorce after 27 years of marriage, but pledged to continue their philanthropic work together.
The foundation said the controlling billionaire benefactors, Bill and Melinda, will contribute $15 billion, their single largest contribution since 2000, bringing the total endowment to about $65 billion.
It also said it will expand the number of trustees to oversee the work and intends to finalize decisions by the end of the year and announce the new trustees in January 2022.

Founded in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has become one of the most powerful and influential forces in global public health. The foundation last year committed some $1.75 billion to COVID-19 relief.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. Treasuries prices maintained gains on Wednesday, holding down yields, and two stock indexes notched record highs after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting largely confirmed market expectations. The dollar remained firm.
At a mid-June meeting, Fed officials said substantial further progress on economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" although participants expected progress to continue, according to the minutes. 
""Various participants"" at the session still felt conditions for curbing the bond-buying that is supplying markets with cash would be ""met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated,"" while others saw a less clear signal from incoming data, said the minutes.
""It looks like they're setting the market up for an announcement on cutting back from this bond buying some time toward the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter,"" said Andrew Richman, senior fixed income strategist at Sterling Capital Management in Jupiter, Florida.
Stock prices and bond yields had wobbled earlier, reflecting fears that the U.S. economic recovery may be slowing, and of the spread of COVID-19 variants. Those factors clouded the view that rates may rise soon to curb inflation, though many investors in any case believe the current inflation signs are temporary.
Bond prices rose during the session, pushing yields lower. At 5:15 p.m. EDT (2115 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 4.7 basis points to 1.323%. During the session the yield dipped as low as 1.2960%.

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.42 points, or 0.01 percent, to 14,665.06.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs Wednesday, as falling yields lifted tech stocks while the Fed's June meeting pointed to a lack of cohesion among members on when the central bank should begin tapering its bond purchases.   
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a record of 4,358.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.30%, or 104 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.1% to a record 14,665.1.
Federal Reserve policymakers generally agreed that the threshold to begin scaling back its monthly bond purchases had not yet been met, according to the Fed's June meeting minutes released Wednesday. But there was uncertainty on when conditions to taper will met as some members expected the threshold to be met earlier than expected, while others preferred to wait for incoming economic data.          
""The Committee's standard of 'substantial further progress' was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected progress to continue,"" the minutes showed. There were, however, various participants that expected the conditions for the taper threshold to be ""met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data.""
The uncertainty of the timing of tapering drew a muted reaction in markets as U.S. bond yields remained near the lows of the day. The plunge in bond yields has been largely attributed to concerns over peak growth and inflation, but some suggest the downward a spiral is more structural rather than fundamental as investors have been forced to unwind their bearish bets on bonds. 
""A lot of people were maybe late to the game putting that short position in Treasuries on, and now we've basically seen a lot of shorts unwind that has exacerbated the move downward,"" John Luke Tyner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday.
Against the backdrop of falling bond yields, meanwhile, growth corners of the market like tech continued to rack up gains, though social media stocks were lagging behind.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) remained below the flatline after former President Donald Trump said he is filing a class-action lawsuit against the social media giant and other tech giants including Twitter and Google as well as their chief executives because of bans imposed on him and others.

This trend is likely to continue given the favorable market environment. For investors looking to invest in newly listed companies with lower risk profiles, we think the shares of the two companies spun off by United Technologies—Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) and Otis (OTIS)—could be solid choices. Let’s discuss.The bullish equity markets and favorable investor sentiment have incentivized several private companies to go public over the past couple of months. The low-cost alternatives to traditional IPOs, such as direct listings and SPACs, have also boosted stock market debuts over the past year. As of June 15, initial public offerings in the United States raised $171 billion, surpassing 2020’s $168 billion. 
The average one-day return for U.S. IPOs through June 30, 2021 was 40.5% versus 28.2% during the same period in 2020. Global IPO proceeds reached 20-year highs in the first quarter of 2021. Global IPO volumes have increased 85% year-over-year, with proceeds increasing 271% year-over-year.
However, investors should consider a company’s financials and growth prospects before investing in its freshly traded shares. With this in mind, we think fundamentally sound companies Carrier Global Corporation (CARR) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:OTIS), which were spun off from renowned United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), could be good additions to one's portfolio.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 04:17PM ET</span>","Factbox-Bezos, Branson and Musk: Who is winning the space tourism race?","(Reuters) - Three billionaire entrepreneurs - Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson - are each vying to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.
Here is how their rival ventures compare in the race to open up space travel.
TICKETS
Bezos, Branson and Musk have been investing billions of dollars in their space startups, each promising to ferry paying customers on rides to space - and it will cost a pretty penny to be part of it.
Branson's Virgin Galactic is reported to have more than 600 ticket reservations already, priced around $250,000. It expects to begin a full commercial service in 2022 and eventually hopes to slash the ticket price to around $40,000. 
Reuters reported in 2018 that Bezos' Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of Branson's rival plans and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed. Blue has not divulged its long-term pricing plans. 
An as-yet unidentified person secured one of the seats on Blue's first suborbital mission, slated for July 20, with a $28 million auction bid. 
Musk's SpaceX has already taken a crew to the International Space Station, and the company has plans to send an all-civilian crew into orbit in September. Musk has also said SpaceX will fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with its forthcoming Starship rocket in 2023.
DESIGN
Virgin Galactic's reusable SpaceShipTwo system will see its VSS Unity spaceplane lifted to altitude by a large carrier aircraft called VMS Eve before separating. 
Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo shoots into suborbital space before separating. The rocket section returns to the launchpad, with the pressurized capsule falls back to earth under parachutes. It features six observation windows - the largest ever used in space.
The SpaceX Dragon capsule sits atop a reusable Falcon rocket which it uses to reach space. 
CREW AND PASSENGERS
Virgin Galactic's spaceplane can hold six passengers: two crew and four passengers.
Blue Origin's craft can take six passengers and flies autonomously. 
The SpaceX Dragon capsule is capable of carrying up to seven people. 
ITINERARY
Virgin Galactic boasts a flight time of around 90 minutes from take-off to landing, including several minutes of weightlessness.
Blue Origin's capsule suborbital flight is around 10 minutes after separation. Again, those on board experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before returning to Earth.
The SpaceX missions are expected to last three to four days from launch to splashdown. 
FUNDING
Typical of Branson's ventures, Virgin Galactic is publicly funded. Its shares peaked at almost $60 following FAA approval in June 2021. 

Blue Origin is privately owned, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos previously indicating he would sell around $1 billion in Amazon stock annually to fund the venture.
SpaceX is also privately owned and has raised billions of dollars in successive funding rounds. Key investors include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Fidelity. Musk says fees charged for SpaceX's charter flights will go toward missions to the moon and eventually Mars.

(Reuters) - Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc, which helped enable the ""meme stock"" frenzy earlier this year and later attracted flak for its handling of the trading mania, is facing pushback on social media forums against its initial public offering. 
Many individual investors are planning to shun the stock market debut, and several posts in recent days urging users to not buy into the IPO have received thousands of upvotes, discussions in online forums on Reddit showed.
""Just ignore the Robinhood IPO entirely,"" said a post on the r/Superstonk subreddit, which also advised traders to transfer out to Fidelity's trading platform.
Robinhood, which has reserved shares in the IPO for retail investors, declined to comment. 
The company came under scrutiny after this year's trading frenzy in the so-called meme stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME). Its handling of the frenzy, marred with glitches and followed by trading restrictions, attracted the wrath of many of its users and U.S. lawmakers.
Since then, a number of threads on social media forums have called for users to boycott the platform entirely.
""Just forget Robinhood altogether. Let them go down in lawsuits and loss of customer base,"" said another recent post with more than 7,000 upvotes. 
Another Redditor said, ""Robinhood has not even been able to keep their app working properly, has not been able to fill orders promptly, has consistently provided incorrect info to users about their trades.""
Robinhood experienced crypto trading and display issues on its platform for about an hour late on Friday.
Last week, Robinhood filed for its widely anticipated market flotation that revealed massive user growth while also flagging a number of investigations by prosecutors and regulators. 

Earlier this year, the trading app operator launched a new platform to provide retail investors with the opportunity to buy shares in IPOs. Robinhood is reserving 20% to 35% of its IPO shares for such investors.
In its IPO filing, the company also warned investors that it could become a meme stock, saying that large participation from retail investors could trigger volatility in the trading price of its stock.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed to fresh record Wednesday, as plunging bond yields helped keep tech in the ascendency, while Fed's June meeting suggested the threshold for bond tapering remains illusive. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to remain close its earlier record of 4,362.30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.17%, or 59 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.1% having also hit a record of 14,755.3 earlier in the day.
Federal Reserve policymakers generally agreed that the threshold to begin scaling back its monthly bond purchases had not yet been met, according to the Fed's June meeting minutes released Wednesday. But there was uncertainty on when conditions to taper will met as some members expected the threshold to be met earlier than expected, while others preferred to wait for incoming economic data.          
""The Committee's standard of 'substantial further progress' was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected progress to continue,"" the minutes showed. There were, however, various participants that expected the conditions for the taper threshold to be ""met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data.""
The uncertainty of the timing of tapering drew a muted reaction in markets as U.S. bond yields remained near the lows of the day.
The move in bond markets serve as a gauge of  ""how investors view the macro landscape going forward,"" according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. But yields are oversold, and could be set for a bounce that, if sustained – the 10-year Treasury yield breaking above 1.50% to 1.60% range - could revive the reflation trade, giving cyclicals a lift.
If yields fail to mount a sustainable charge higher, then ""then choppy-to-lower trading is likely to favor a 'low-rate / low-growth' environment for some time,"" Luschini added.
Against the backdrop of falling bond yields, meanwhile, growth corners of the market like tech continued to rack up gains, though social media stocks were lagging behind.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) remained below the flatline after former President Donald Trump said he is filing a class-action lawsuit against the social media giant and other tech giants including Twitter and Google as well as their chief executives because of bans imposed on him and others.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recovered losses, while Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fell nearly 2%.
Materials and industrials were also among the biggest sector gainers, while energy slipped further into the red after oil prices reversed gains
Oil prices continue to lose ground as the failure of OPEC+ to agree a new output plan, stoked concerns that members of the production-cut accord may break away from the agreement, potentially leading to uptick in global supplies."

Stocks ended higher last Tuesday as economic data beat estimates. The S&P 500 index was up for the fourth consecutive day, its longest rally since March. U.S. consumer confidence hit a 16-month high due to growing labor market optimism, re-openings, and reduced inflation fears.

(Reuters) -Didi Global Inc fell for the third consecutive session on Wednesday after China ordered the app removed from mobile app stores as part of a broader crackdown on China-based companies with overseas listings.
In its fifth day of trading as a U.S.-listed company, the stock was last down 4.2%, about 28% below its $16.65 offer price.
Beijing extended its actions beyond the tech sector on Tuesday, vowing to step up scrutiny of Chinese companies listed offshore in order to crack down on illegal activity. 
On Wednesday, China fined internet companies including Didi, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd for failing to get approval for earlier merger and acquisition deals.
U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) were last off 1.1% and 2.4%, respectively.
Including Didi, the largest U.S. listing by a Chinese company since 2014, a record $12.5 billion has been raised so far in 2021 from Chinese firms listing in the United States, Refinitiv data shows.
In a sign of nervousness among investors about Didi, index publisher FTSE Russell also warned that it would not include Didi's shares in its global equity indexes if trading is halted in Wednesday's session.
As of 3:15 p.m. EDT, trade of Didi shares had not been halted.
""For Didi, the situation is bleak, but for Chinese companies preparing to list in the U.S. it may be even bleaker,"" said Samuel Indyk, senior analyst at uk.Investing.com.
Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio last month had called for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block Didi's IPO https:// because China does not allow auditors to conduct the same oversight that other U.S.-listed companies face.
""Allowing Didi, an unaccountable company based in China, to list on the New York Stock Exchange was reckless and irresponsible,"" he said on Wednesday. ""Beijing’s recent crackdown on the company only further underscores the risks posed by Chinese companies to U.S. investors.""
In June, the U.S. Senate passed a bill led by Senator John Kennedy, which would pressure China by requiring foreign companies to hasten their compliance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board audits. The bill still needs to pass in the U.S. House of Representatives.
""The drop in the value of Didi shares further highlights that the Chinese Communist Party is perhaps the biggest threat facing U.S. investors today,"" an aide to Kennedy said. 
Analytics firm S3 Partners warned of another surge in short-selling of U.S.-listed Chinese companies as a clampdown by Beijing drove a third straight day of selling of ride-hailing giant Didi. 
Short interest in the group has fallen to $43.5 billion from $50.6 billion this year, while short interest as a percentage of float fell to 3.81% from 5.67%, reflecting a closing out of some positions that were in the red after a market rally in January and February, Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics, said in a report.
Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF, which tracks U.S. exchange-listed companies that are headquartered in China, has lost a third of its value from its February high, meaning short sellers who bet against the index over that period should have profited.

""We’ve been hearing the back and forth with U.S. and China with tougher regulations on IPOs,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""It’s one small part of two superpowers disagreeing on many things,"" Detrick added. ""It’s a fallout from a deeper divide.""

Shares of  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) and  Revolve Group  (NYSE:RVLV) look significantly overvalued at their current price levels given their weak growth prospects. So, we think these stocks are best avoided now. Please read on for details.The halt in brick-and-mortar store sales last year caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with stiff competition from established e-commerce vendors, negatively affected the apparel retail sector significantly last year. But with the accelerating economic recovery, a gradual resumption of store operations, and increased consumer spending, the apparel retail industry is witnessing a solid recovery this year.
Investors’ interest in the broader retail sector is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 41.9% returns over the past six months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 15.9% gains. With more than 3.26 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses administered across 180 countries so far, consumers should be increasingly inclined to shop at physical stores..
However, bullish sentiment has sent the prices of some apparel stocks soaring above what can be justified based on their fundamentals and financials. Since their weak financials and gloomy growth prospects do not justify their premium valuations, we think Stitch Fix, Inc. (SFIX) and Revolve Group, Inc.

(Reuters) -A federal judge found the U.S. government was 60% responsible for a 2017 mass shooting in which a former Air Force airman used firearms he should not have been allowed to purchase to kill 26 people at a rural Texas church.
In a decision released on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez said the Air Force did not use reasonable care when it failed to enter Devin Patrick Kelley's plea to domestic violence charges in a database used for background checks for those buying firearms.
Rodriguez said the government bore ""significant responsibility"" for harm to victims of the Nov. 5, 2017 massacre at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, 31 miles (50 km) east of San Antonio.
Twenty-two people were also injured when Kelley, dressed in black and wearing a skull mask, opened fire at a Sunday service.
Kelley, 26, died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head after crashing his vehicle into a ditch following a chase, officials said.
Victims and their families sued the government for its alleged negligence in letting Kelley buy weapons, despite his admission in a 2012 court martial to striking his former wife and infant stepson.
Kelley was discharged for bad conduct in 2014. A government report in December 2018 said the Air Force missed six chances to alert law enforcement about his history of domestic abuse.
In a 99-page decision, Rodriguez rejected the government's claim it could not foresee the shooting, saying it knew more than even Kelley's parents about his capacity for violence.
""Had the government done its job and properly reported Kelley's information into the background check system, (it) is more likely than not that Kelley would have been deterred from carrying out the church shooting,"" he wrote.
The San Antonio judge found Kelley only 40% responsible for the shooting. He ruled after a 10-day bench trial in April, and plans a separate trial on damages.

Tom Jacob, a lawyer for some plaintiffs, called the decision a ""huge step"" for families who ""endured so much loss and then had to endure their government trying to avoid responsibility.""
The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.

The food sector has gained investor attention over the past few years, especially as fast-food chains and upscale restaurants create new menus to attract health- and environment-conscious diners.
Chobani, which means shepherd in Turkish, makes yogurt, oatmilk, dairy- and plant-based creamers and probiotic beverages, and ready-to-drink coffee. 
It was founded in 2005 by Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant to the United States, who took a small loan and bought an old yogurt plant, according to its website. The first cup of Chobani Greek yogurt hit store shelves in 2007. 
The company, which has factories in New York, Idaho and Australia, has not yet determined the number of shares it plans to sell or the price range for its proposed offering. 

It rejected a bid for a majority stake from beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc in 2016, arguing that it wanted to remain independent. 
Chobani's peers are also looking at U.S. capital market which has hit all-time records in terms of capital raised through IPOs. Swedish vegan milk maker Oatly Group AB, which counts Oprah Winfrey among its backers, raised $1.4 billion in its U.S. IPO in May, while Reuters reported in April that Impossible Foods Inc is preparing for a public listing which could value the plant-based burger maker at around $10 billion.

The company saw its bookings and revenues surge significantly in the first quarter. Is the stock still a buy?.Vacation rental and tourism company Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) operates an online marketplace for unique homestays and tourism experiences. The company made its Nasdaq debut last December and hit its all-time high of $219.94 on February 11. However, closing yesterday’s session at $148.37, the stock is trading 32.5% below its all-time high. Moreover, the stock lost 20.9% over the past three months and 3.1% over the past five days. Also, ABNB is currently trading lower than its 50-day moving average of $149.80, but higher than its 200-day moving average of $119.60, which does not indicate a robust uptrend.
Although the anticipated travel rebound amid increasing vaccinations around the globe, helped it attract over $10 billion of bookings in the first quarter of 2021, it recorded significant losses. On top of that, the slow recovery of business travel, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s business, is a major headwind. Since it could take a significant amount of time for ABNB’s business to recover fully from the losses, the stock’s upside is limited.

So, it could be rewarding to bet on shares of  Tri Pointe Homes  (NYSE:TPH), Haverty Furniture (NYSE:HVT), Hovnanian (HOV), and  Hooker Furniture  (NASDAQ:HOFT) that should see costs decline.Lumber prices skyrocketed earlier this year as its demand soared with the strong housing market. This, along with an increase in renovating and upgrading home interiors, coupled with lower production at lumber mills, drove up prices. 
However, with the reopening of the economy based on solid progress on the vaccination front, renovation and DIY projects have taken a backseat as people are returning to outdoor activities. Sawmills have picked up the pace of the output, easing the lumber shortage. These factors led to lumber prices plunging more than 40% in June.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 02:07PM ET</span>",Analysis: When do electric vehicles become cleaner than gasoline cars?,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - You glide silently out of the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) showroom in your sleek new electric Model 3, satisfied you're looking great and doing your bit for the planet.
But keep going - you'll have to drive another 13,500 miles (21,725 km) before you're doing less harm to the environment than a gas-guzzling saloon.
That's the result of a Reuters analysis of data from a model that calculates the lifetime emissions of vehicles, a hotly debated issue that's taking center stage as governments around the world push for greener transport to meet climate targets.
The model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Chicago and includes thousands of parameters from the type metals in an electric vehicle (EV) battery to the amount of aluminium or plastic in a car. 
Argonne's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model is now being used with other tools to help shape policy at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board, the two main regulators of vehicle emissions in the United States.
Jarod Cory Kelly, principal energy systems analyst at Argonne, said making EVs generates more carbon than combustion engine cars, mainly due to the extraction and processing of minerals in EV batteries and production of the power cells.
But estimates as to how big that carbon gap is when a car is first sold and where the ""break-even"" point comes for EVs during their lifetime can vary widely, depending on the assumptions.
Kelly said the payback period then depends on factors such as the size of the EV's battery, the fuel economy of a gasoline car and how the power used to charge an EV is generated.
NORWAY'S A WINNER
Reuters plugged a series of variables into the Argonne model, which had more than 43,000 users as of 2021, to come up with some answers. 
The Tesla 3 scenario above was for driving in the United States, where 23% of electricity comes from coal-fired plants, with a 54 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery and a cathode made of nickel, cobalt and aluminum, among other variables.
It was up against a gasoline-fueled Toyota Corolla weighing 2,955 pounds with a fuel efficiency of 33 miles per gallon. It was assumed both vehicles would travel 173,151 miles during their lifetimes. 
But if the same Tesla was being driven in Norway, which generates almost all its electricity from renewable hydropower, the break-even point would come after just 8,400 miles. 
If the electricity to recharge the EV comes entirely from coal, which generates the majority of the power in countries such as China and Poland, you would have to drive 78,700 miles to reach carbon parity with the Corolla, according to the Reuters analysis of data generated by Argonne's model.
The Reuters analysis showed that the production of a mid-sized EV saloon generates 47 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per mile during the extraction and production process, or more than 8.1 million grams before it reaches the first customer. 
By comparison, a similar gasoline vehicle generates 32 grams per mile, or more than 5.5 million grams.
Michael Wang, senior scientist and director of the Systems Assessment Center at Argonne's Energy Systems division, said EVs then generally emit far less carbon over a 12-year lifespan.
Even in the worst case scenario where an EV is charged only from a coal-fired grid, it would generate an extra 4.1 million grams of carbon a year while a comparable gasoline car would produce over 4.6 million grams, the Reuters analysis showed. 
When are EVs cleaner than gas cars? https://graphics.reuters.com/ELECTRIC-VEHICLES/EMISSIONS/rlgpdrmjmpo/chart.png 
'WELL-TO-WHEEL'
The EPA told Reuters it uses GREET to help evaluate standards for renewable fuel and vehicle greenhouse gases while the California Air Resources Board uses the model to help assess compliance with the state's low-carbon fuel standard.
The EPA said it also used Argonne's GREET to develop an online program that allows U.S. consumers to estimate the emissions from EVs based on the fuels used to generate electric power in their area. https:// The results of the Reuters analysis are similar to those in a life-cycle assessment of electric and combustion-engine vehicles in Europe by research group IHS Markit.  Its ""well-to-wheel"" study showed the typical break-even point in carbon emissions for EVs was about 15,000 to 20,000 miles, depending on the country, according to Vijay Subramanian, IHS Markit's global director of carbon dioxide (CO2) compliance. He said using such an approach showed there were long-term benefits from shifting to electric vehicles. Some are less positive about EVs.  University of Liege researcher Damien Ernst said in 2019 that the typical EV would have to travel nearly 700,000 km before it emitted less CO2 than a comparable gasoline vehicle. He later revised his figures down.  Now, he estimates the break-even point could be between 67,000 km and 151,000 km. Ernst told Reuters he did not plan to change those findings, which were based on a different set of data and assumptions than in Argonne's model. Some other groups also continue to argue that EVs are not necessarily cleaner or greener than fossil-fueled cars. 
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents over 600 companies in the oil industry, states on its website: ""Multiple studies show that, on a life-cycle basis, different automobile powertrains result in similar greenhouse gas emissions."" Argonne National Laboratory is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by the University of Chicago.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shares of financial technology company Wise ended 10% up on their first day of trading on Wednesday in London's largest ever tech listing that could pave the way for other firms looking to go public without the help of underwriters.
Britain's government has been keen to attract technology groups to list in the country and its financial watchdog earlier this week outlined proposals to make it easier for them to list to help London compete with New York and the EU post-Brexit.
Wire shares opened at 800 pence -- in line with an auction process in the preceding hours, which saw an indicated price range of 750-820 pence as the group completed the first direct listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). 
They closed at 880 pence, valuing the company at 8.75 billion pounds ($11 billion) and becoming London's biggest tech company by market capitalisation, well above the $6-$7 billion market expectations from earlier this year. 
This strong result crowns a record-breaking year for London listings and could also encourage other fast-growing British firms in the financial technology sector, a dozen investors, entrepreneurs and experts told Reuters.
""The unruffled start to trading should help London’s efforts to maintain its reputation as a Fin Tech hub as it has struggled to attract fast growing companies keen to list,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdowne.
""But now more firms might see direct listings as a good alternative to traditional IPOs which are more costly, needing the input of expensive services from investment banks.""
FINTECH UNICORNS
The cross-border payments company, one of Britain's most well-known fintech unicorns, last month launched the direct listing, which allows for a listing without a public offering of shares. 
Such listings have been growing in popularity among technology companies in the United States such as Coinbase, Roblox and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
Several tech companies including Deliveroo, Trustpilot and Moonpig have already listed in London this year and helped push initial public offerings (IPO) to a record high.
""It's definitely helpful to have well-known brands with strong success stories on domestic markets. They are few and far between so far, but the more that come to market the better,"" said Daniel Turgel, a partner in the M&A and corporate practice at White & Case.
Wise does not actually wire money in the same way as peers like  Western Union  (NYSE:WU), rather it holds balances in countries on popular currency routes to sidestep high fees, said Dan Thomas, an analyst at Third Bridge.

""Wise has a distinct advantage over peers like Western Union and Moneygram because origination is 100% digital and they don’t have to maintain a network of physical locations to disburse cash,"" he said.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC to consider new 'sustainable' fund criteria, data disclosure rules","By Katanga Johnson and Ross Kerber
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday the regulator would consider rules to require ""sustainable"" fund managers to disclose the criteria and underlying data used to support the label.
Regulators and activists are becoming increasingly concerned that U.S. funds looking to cash in on the popularity of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing may be misleading shareholders over their products' underlying holdings, a practice known as ""greenwashing.""
Gensler told an SEC panel that the potential fund rules would complement new public company climate change risk disclosure requirements the agency plans to propose in October.
They would also aim to stamp out product mis-selling and establish standardized language around sustainable investing, Gensler told the SEC's Asset Management Advisory Committee.
""In investing, funds often disclose objective metrics as well,"" Gensler added. ""When it comes to sustainability-related investing, though, there's currently a huge range of what asset managers might mean by certain terms or what criteria they use.""
The SEC has previously said it would scrutinize investment advisers and funds touting sustainable products for greenwashing, but Gensler's remarks on Wednesday provided more details on how the agency would address the issue.
European regulators have introduced rules to tackle greenwashing but the United States lags behind. With a record $51 billion flooding into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar, investors need to be better informed about what's in those funds, the SEC has said. 
After Gensler spoke, the panel - which advocates on behalf of investors - voted to adopt recommendations including a call for mutual fund boards to share details about the race and gender of their members, and for the SEC to encourage companies to provide useful information on ESG matters. 

No dissensions or abstentions were heard among committee members in the voice votes at the meeting, which was webcast, underscoring the broad industry support for the ideas.
Hester Peirce, a Republican member of the SEC, warned before the votes, however, that the SEC should not adopt rules that prove ""unworkable and imprudent"" and that requiring things like reporting ethnic data could be divisive.

(Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa raised 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in a corporate bond sale on Wednesday, boosting its finances after a state bail-out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lufthansa, which was hit hard by the ensuing tourism crisis, had already issued a bond in February to repay part of last year's 9 billion euro bailout from state lender KfW.
""The repeated successful placement of a corporate bond again confirms our access to a variety of advantageous financing instruments,"" finance chief Remco Steenbergen said in a statement.
The company said it issued three and eight-year bonds, confirming an earlier Reuters report that cited a memo from a lead manager on the deal, becoming the latest of several major airlines to tap the debt markets.
The tranche with a term until 2024 bears interest of 2.0% per year, while it's 3.5% for the tranche maturing in 2029, Lufthansa said.
The shorter-dated tranche received demand of over 900 million euros and the longer one 1 billion, according to the memo.
Among Lufthansa's peers, Air France-KLM, easyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Ryanair have all sold bonds this year as COVID-19 vaccinations have supported a brighter economic outlook and better prospects for the travel sector.
Lufthansa said it would use the proceeds to strengthen its liquidity. Citi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC and ING managed the transaction, according to an earlier memo.
Reuters reported in May that Lufthansa was sounding out investors about a capital increase worth roughly 3 billion euros, looking at either a June/July or September/October window, after shareholders approved a potential increase of up to 5.5 billion.

The company said on Wednesday preparations for a share sale were underway, adding no decision on the size and timing had been taken.

This backdrop is expected to benefit Humana (HUM) and Clover Health (CLOV). But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Humana Inc . (NYSE:HUM), in Louisville, Ky. and Franklin, Tenn.-based Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV) are two prominent players in the health insurance industry. HUM offers commercial fully insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, coordinated health care through health maintenance organizations (HMO), and administrative services products. Whereas CLOV, through its Clover Assistant software platform, provides Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and HMO health plans to Medicare-eligible consumers.
Designed to lower health care costs and extend health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, the Affordable Care Act has increased competition among insurers significantly on premium price and value. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, health insurers have been upgrading their policies with various premium options, favorable reimbursement rates, adding coverage of various diseases, and making long-term contracts with healthcare providers to capitalize on ACA’s rising enrollment. Consequently, the global health insurance market is expected to grow at 5.5% CAGR to hit $3.04 trillion by 2028. So, we believe both HUM and CLOV should benefit substantially in the coming months.
While CLOV gained 11.1% over the past month, HUM has returned 6.4%. And in terms of their past three month’s performance, CLOV is again the clear winner with 31.4% gains versus HUM’s 11.4% returns.

Authentic Brands, which also owns the Forever 21 brand, plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""AUTH"", it said in a regulatory filing.
The company's 2020 net income jumped to about $211 million from $72.5 million a year earlier, while its revenue rose
nearly 2% to $488.9 million.
The firm was targeting a valuation of about $10 billion in its IPO, CNBC reported in May, citing a person familiar with the matter.
At a time when peers like PVH are streamlining their portfolios by selling off brands, Authentic Brands Group has rapidly amassed over 30 labels that are sold at about 6,000 stores. Its rich portfolio of brands include those in media, entertainment, fashion, home, active and outdoor lifestyle sectors.
Authentic Brands Group last month entered into a deal with Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) to buy Izod, Van Heusen, Arrow and Geoffrey Beene trademarks in a deal valued at about $220 million.

The Nautica brand owner also said in the filing it intended to buy more brands, with opportunities within lifestyle, entertainment and other new areas.
BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC are among the lead underwriters to the IPO.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's bosses have called on the government to delay its ""step into the unknown"" of forcing companies to hire two auditors to improve standards and competition after a string of corporate failures.
After the collapse of retailer BHS and builder Carillion, the government wants to introduce shared audits but despite three government-backed reviews, reform has been slow, partly due to the pandemic and Brexit eating into parliamentary time.
With a shared audit, a ""challenger"" auditor would audit a ""meaningful"" portion of a blue chip's books, while a Big Four auditor, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY, would do most of the work.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) said in its response to the government's plan that it backed efforts to address recent failings in auditing, but wanted the plans phased in over a longer period as companies recover from the COVID-19 crisis.
Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng has said he would introduce the changes over an appropriate timetable.
The Big Four dominate auditing of blue chips, and the idea behind shared audit is to give ""challengers"" like BDO, Grant Thornton and Mazars a chance to build up experience with big clients.
""We are particularly worried about the willingness and capacity of smaller challenger audit firms to take on major audits in partnership with the Big Four,"" said Roger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the IoD in a statement.
""This is a step into the unknown, and the concept needs to be properly tested before it is rolled out.""
There should be pilot before the regime is rolled out to all top companies, the IoD said.
France has applied a system of two auditors for many years, but the idea has received criticism from some quarters in Britain.

Jon Thompson, CEO of the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates auditors, said last month that some companies would prefer the alternative of a cap on Big Four market share.
""Resolving this is likely to require further work,"" he added.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Atlantia considers its 16% stake in German builder Hochtief non-strategic and may sell it in the future as it gears up to rejig its investment portfolio after agreeing to sell its Italian motorway unit, three sources said.
""The Hochtief stake is not strategic .. and the group is considering getting out of the construction business in the future,"" one of the sources said.
No final decision has been taken on the potential sale of Hochtief's stake and there is no urgency, another source said.
""At the moment there are no plans to sell Atlantia's stake in Hochtief and any future decision would take into account potential developments in partnerships and joint ventures with Hochtief, Abertis and Atlantia on new motorway projects,"" a source at Atlantia said.
Hochtief declined to comment on the issue.
Hochtief shares ended the day down 2.9% after earlier falling more than 4%. 
Atlantia, which acquired 23.9% of Hochtief in 2018 as part of a deal to take over Spanish toll road operator Abertis together with Spain's ACS, currently owns a 15.9% stake, which at present market values is worth around 750 million euros ($887 million).
The Italian group is the second biggest investor in the German group behind Spanish partner ACS, which owns 50.4%.
The investment was initially aimed at developing green-field construction projects, but Abertis then opted to go down a different path, with acquisitions of motorway assets including a deal in 2020 to buy U.S. tunnel operator Elizabeth River Crossing. 
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, is currently considering options after agreeing to sell its Italian motorway business to a consortium led by state lender CDP earlier this year following a deadly bridge collapse three years ago.
The group, which will raise some 8 billion euros in cash from the CDP deal, is working with McKinsey to identify a set of strategic options by the end of the year, one of the sources said.
The sources said the group was looking to expand its digital payments unit Telepass, perhaps through acquisitions in Europe, and could also consider developing a network of small airports linked to the leisure business. 
Last year Atlantia agreed to sell a 49% stake in Telepass for more than 1 billion euros to transform the unit into a pan-European multi-service platform for consumers and businesses.

The group is also looking into new investments in motorway assets and could venture into sustainability-linked businesses such as renewable energy and sustainable mobility projects, the sources said.

Investing.com – Newegg Commerce (NASDAQ:NEGG) jumped 90% after being up more than 100% earlier in Wednesday’s session as traders lapped up the company’s latest offering: a $99 service to assemble your purchased computer parts into a desktop.
Until now, Newegg let customers design their PCs. Now it will also assemble them. Newegg is building custom PCs for gamers needing maximum gaming performance.
Higher customization will be offered as the service rolls on.
The announcement caught more people by surprise because it comes at a time when critical computer components like processors, memory chips and graphics cards are in short supply. This has escalated prices of computers and laptops and also caused longer waiting time. A company willing to offer customized PCs is thus bound to raise eyebrows, and in this case, its share price as well.  
While many of Newegg’s tech-savvy customers prefer to build their PCs themselves, there’s a large unaddressed market of customers who would rather opt for professional assembly.
Building a PC can be a complicated process with many configuration possibilities.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>","Short exit stampede at 1.4% drives U.S. Treasury yield slump, traders say","By Saikat Chatterjee and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - An unwinding of bets by some hedge funds against 10-year U.S. Treasuries, the world's safest asset, explains the sudden ructions in bond markets, traders and fund managers told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which move inversely to prices, recently stood at around 1.30% in New York trading after falling to a more than four-month low of 1.296 earlier in the session. They are now more than 45 bps below a January 2020 high of 1.77% hit in March.
The drop in bond yields paints a gloomy picture for the popular ""reflation"" trade, which has seen investors pile into economically-sensitive stocks that tend to do well when yields rise, including banks and energy companies. The Russell 1000 value index, which ripped higher earlier in the year, is down more than 2% from its early June peak.
Traders attributed the unwind to a variety of factors, from stop-loss orders triggering a cascade of Treasury buying to investors seeking havens amid growing worries over economic growth and the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19.
One trader at a European bank said the move was fuelled by the drop in U.S. Treasury yields below the 1.40% level as many funds had hedged some of their wider reflation bets by putting stop-loss orders at that level.
Stop-loss orders are essentially trades where investors hedge their broader market trades by taking an opposite position to trim losses in case markets move against them.
'DEATH CROSS'
Another trader saw the move as technical, saying U.S. Treasury yields were a variation of the popular ""death cross"" in financial markets, where short-term moving averages (50-day) intersect with longer-term averages (100-day) pointing to lower yields.
""There was a spike around the 1.38-1.40 area and getting through that triggered some stops (stop losses),"" said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at Mediolanum International Funds.
""When it got to those levels, people who were short were feeling uncomfortable and started selling.""
A client survey from JP Morgan showed net bearish bets against Treasuries falling to their lowest level since late April in the week to July 6, while bullish positions stood at their highest since late March.
Net bearish bets on 10-year Treasury futures jumped to 59,960 contracts for the week ended June 29, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. [US/]
""I think a lot of this is just short-covering,” said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""The market is not ready to go to higher yields and every little down tick is quickly met with buyers.""
Daily turnover on the front-month 10-year U.S. Treasury futures was nearly 2 million contracts, the largest since May 26 but less than half of 2021's peak of more than 4 million in late February, according to Refinitiv data.
The move rippled across the yield curve and caught broader markets by surprise, with the high-flying Australian dollar weakening sharply.
Though yields were under pressure for the last few weeks, the move lower accelerated after they began July at below 1.50%.
The seasonal summer lull in financial markets are also a reason for outsized moves, said one fund manager who declined to be named. He said the moves in U.S. debt were triggered by hedge funds, though the size of the trades were not ""massive"".
Apart from positioning and technicals, the recent spread of the Delta COVID-19 variant and weak U.S. services activity data also weighed on investor sentiment, prompting them to seek safety in U.S. Treasuries.
""This is likely a shift in market narrative: away from inflation concerns to concerns about the sustainability of growth momentum, and you see that in pretty much every market,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, head of FX strategy at Banque Lombard Odier & Cie SA.

The company, which lost about $15 billion of market value on Tuesday alone, had the second-largest U.S. IPO for a Chinese firm on record, raising $4.4 billion.
Securities class action law firms filed complaints in federal court in New York and Los Angeles late on Tuesday, saying the company failed to disclose ongoing talks it was having with Chinese authorities about its compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations. The Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2 that it had begun an investigation of Didi and two days later ordered that the company’s app be removed from smartphone app stores.
The suits named Chief Executive Officer Will Wei Cheng, President Jean Qing Liu and several other executives and directors. Lead underwriters Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) were also named as defendants.
Didi didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman, Morgan and JPMorgan also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
China Risk Factors
Didi listed several risks factors associated with doing business with a Chinese firm subject to Chinese regulation in its IPO prospectus, but the suits said the company failed to highlight the ongoing talks it was having with regulators in Beijing.
“Rather than disclose the known discussions into the company’s practices and non-compliance with relevant technology laws, the registration statement vaguely discussed China’s regulatory regime with regards to data security,” shareholder Rafael Espinal said in the New York suit.
Chinese regulators asked Didi as early as three months ago to delay its landmark U.S. IPO because of cybersecurity concerns, according to people familiar with the matter. Shortly after launching its review of Didi, the Chinese government issued a sweeping warning to the country’s biggest tech companies, vowing to tighten oversight of both data security and overseas listings.
The corporate structure employed by Didi and other large Chinese companies that list in the U.S. could present a challenge to plaintiffs. U.S. shareholders can only own stakes in Chinese tech companies indirectly through offshore companies known as variable interest entities, which the Chinese government has suggested it will begin regulating more closely.

Didi warned IPO investors in its prospectus that their ability to protect their “rights through U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.”

1369,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 11:31AM ET</span>",3 Top Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in July,"As the digital transformation picks up pace, the demand for semiconductors is increasing because they are a critical component in advanced technological devices. The semiconductor industry is seeing huge demand from the electric vehicles (EV) industry also. This heightened demand is driving up chip prices, which we think should result in solid upside for semiconductor stocks such as ON Semiconductor (ON), Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD), and Vishay (VSH). So, let’s pore over these names.The mainstream adoption of remote working due to its convenience and efficiency, along with the ongoing digital transformation, are increasing the demand for semiconductors. Semiconductors form the backbone of most advanced technological devices. The semiconductor industry is also witnessing increasing demand from the electric vehicles (EV) industry. While supply constraints are impacting the industry, the strong demand environment is allowing companies to raise prices for their chips and generate substantial profits. And, investors’ increasing interest in the semiconductor industry is evident in the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 6.7% gains over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.2% returns.
Many semiconductor companies are ramping up their production to meet the rising demand for chips. In fact, the industry is benefiting from government and private investments worldwide to expand production capacity. According to The  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS), the chip shortage is expected to decline in the second half of the year.
The industry is expected to continue growing due to increasing demand for chips with the growing adoption of advanced technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), 5G, and artificial intelligence (AI). According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global semiconductor market is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2028. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong semiconductor players ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON), Diodes Incorporated (DIOD), and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH).

However, the question becomes, is it wise to buy the dip considering BAX’s growth prospects? Let’s find out.Shares of rental and hospital products provider Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) have gained more than 76% over the past five years, leveraging the company’s wide portfolio of products and therapies that can be found across hospitals and clinics, pharmacies and ICUs. BAX is based in Deerfield, Ill.
However, the stock has lost 4.5% over the past three months and 8% year-to-date—to close yesterday’s trading session at $81.07—due to a darkening in hedge fund sentiment lately. Investors’ concerns over the company’s decline in net income in the first quarter could be another reason for the stock’s weak performance so far this year. While BAX’s revenues grew across its major segments, its net income for the quarter declined 9.9% year-over-year to $300 million.
BAX has collaborated with  Moderna , Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Novavax , Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX) to provide fill/finish sterile manufacturing services and supply packaging for their COVID-19 vaccines. It paid a $0.28 quarterly dividend per share on July 1, which represents a roughly 14% increase over the previous quarterly dividend. So, the stock’s prospects look promising.

Deutsche Post, one of the world's largest logistics firms, expects operating profit to increase to more than 7 billion euros ($8.26 billion) in 2021, up from a previous forecast of 6.7 billion euros.
It also raised its forecast for operating profit in 2023, predicting it will reach more than 7.4 billion euros, up from an earlier prediction of more than 7 billion.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dipped 3% Wednesday on concerns the company may face higher scrutiny in China amid a crackdown on consumer-facing internet companies in the world’s second largest economy.
Likewise,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas sees Tesla coming under a stronger lens in China, the largest market for its electric vehicles outside the U.S.
Over the weekend, Chinese authorities asked ride-haling company Didi not to onboard new users until its data privacy and security policies have been reviewed. It asked WeChat and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) to take the app off their stores.
Similar treatment was meted out to online recruitment firm Kanzhun (NASDAQ:BZ).  
With many Chinese internet companies listed in the U.S., there are concerns in the communist country over the trove of user data they may have to share as part of disclosure norms for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The analyst has in the past expressed concerns around the commercialization of AI in consumer applications and the governments, through a national security lens, apply a regime that could limit, if not outright exclude, the role of foreign players in their domestic autonomous transport networks.
“As an exercise, ask yourself this: Can you imagine a Chinese-owned autonomous, electric transport network providing mobility services to the citizens of Boston or Pittsburgh,"" Jonas wrote in his note, according to StreetInsider.
Jonas reiterated an overweight on Tesla with a $900 target, almost 41% higher from its current level of $640.

LONDON (Reuters) - Supermarket group Morrisons has written to Britain's business minister and other politicians seeking to head off any opposition to its agreed 6.3 billion pound ($8.7 billion) takeover by private equity firm Fortress Investment Group.
Newspaper reports have said business minister Kwasi Kwarteng wants a meeting with Morrisons to seek reassurances over jobs, pensions and other matters, although a person with knowledge of the matter said there had been no request so far. 
Morrisons backed the offer from SoftBank-owned Fortress on Saturday, which topped a 5.52 billion pound proposal from U.S. private equity company Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) that was rejected on June 17.
On Monday Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), another private equity company, said it was also considering an offer. 
The letter to Kwarteng, seen by Reuters, details why Morrisons considers Fortress would be a ""suitable and appropriate owner"" and a ""good steward"".
The letter was copied to George Eustice, Britain's minister for the environment, food and rural affairs. Similar ones were also sent to lawmakers from constituencies where Morrisons is a major employer.
The opposition Labour Party and unions have said a buyout could hit jobs and investment, although a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said takeover proposals were a matter for the companies involved. 
Legal & General Investment Management, Morrisons' eighth biggest shareholder according to Refinitiv data, has expressed concern about an acquirer buying Morrisons property portfolio too cheaply and loading the company with debt. 
Morrisons employs over 111,000 workers, trades from nearly 500 stores and is unique among British supermarket groups in making over half of the fresh food it sells.
Its letter lists assurances it has received from Fortress, which include retaining Morrisons' current management team and executing its existing strategy, keeping its head office in Bradford, northern England, and not selling stores.
Other pledges centre on safeguarding workers' current conditions and pension rights, maintaining good relationships with suppliers and farmers, and pursuing existing commitments on sustainability and food security.
""Given all these assurances, the Morrisons board believes that Fortress would be a suitable and responsible owner,"" the letter states.

Morrisons shares are trading above Fortress' offer of 254 pence apiece, suggesting investors expect a higher bid. The stock was last at 268 pence.

Schedules are expanding as airlines sense consumer demand for travel rising and progress with COVID-19 vaccinations means shuttered routes could resume, International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh told reporters. 
""I think we have to be optimistic that we will see a relaxation in relation to transatlantic flying during the coming weeks,"" Walsh said on Wednesday.
Major airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), IAG (LON:ICAG) unit British Airways, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines have for some months been pushing the U.S. and UK governments to re-open travel between the two countries citing the pair's advanced vaccination programmes.
Walsh said there had been no announcement on the matter at the G7 leaders meeting in June due to a lack of data about the vaccine's efficacy against the Delta variant of the virus, but that had changed now.
A transatlantic re-opening would be a huge boost for the airlines. 
Walsh's optimism came after IATA published figures for May showing that passenger air travel demand remains subdued globally, 63% lower in May 2021 compared to the same month two years ago before the pandemic struck.
Walsh blamed ongoing restrictions and a lack of co-ordination between governments for creating consumer confusion and hindering the speed at which aviation can recover. 
He said data showed that the risk of re-opening borders was very, very low where people were fully vaccinated or where sensible testing regimes were used to facilitate travel.

Governments would come under increasing pressure to allow travel, he forecast, as growing numbers of vaccinated consumers, who were reluctant to holiday at the height of the pandemic, demand their freedom again.
""What we're seeing is a shift in the consumer attitudes over time and I think that's going to accelerate now, as people become more frustrated at the pace at which governments are moving,"" he said.

Also, increased personal consumption and government spending are expected to power the retail industry further. Consequently, we believe that retail companies with strong fundamentals, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), and Costco Wholesale (COST), are well positioned to witness solid growth this year and beyond. Let’s discuss.A return to normalcy, on the back of a rapid rollout of vaccines and government stimulus spending, is boosting consumer spending, which in turn is driving retail-sales growth. Because most of the U.S. population has now been vaccinated, the pent-up demand for in-store shopping is expected to drive retail companies’ growth. In addition, as the need for digitization and online shopping grows, industry leaders are focusing on modernizing their operations to meet the needs of customers and simultaneously boost their revenue through digital engagements.
As the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and customers spend the money that they have saved over the past year, retail sales are projected to rise between 10.5% - 13.5% to $4.44 trillion - $4.56 trillion in 2021. Indeed, the National Retail Federation expects the retail industry to witness “the fastest growth” in the country since 1984.
So, we believe shares of prominent retailers Walmart Inc. (WMT), The Home Depot (HD), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are great long-term bets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Four global banks will next month launch a pilot platform for buying and selling voluntary carbon credits, they said on Wednesday, the latest sign of growing interest from the financial community in the burgeoning carbon offset market.
A private sector task force on scaling up the voluntary carbon market said earlier this year the market will need to grow 15-fold to meet goals set under the Paris climate agreement and could be worth $5-$50 billion by 2030.
Britain’s NatWest Group, Canada’s Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Australia’s National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) and Brazil’s Itaú Unibanco said their Project Carbon initiative would help create a more liquid market for carbon offsets and help clients to manage risks associated with climate costs.
""Climate change is one of the most important challenges of our time. We’re helping our business and personal banking customers to understand and reduce their carbon footprints through partnerships like Project Carbon,"" said Alison Rose, chief executive officer of NatWest Group.
The platform will enable buyers to fully trace which projects the carbon credits have come from and act as a record of ownership of the credits, the banks said in a joint statement.

It will also look at how blockchain technology can be used to trade credits and help to make the market more accessible to customers.
""The team is keen to invite like-minded institutions to join the cohort to help deliver a shared service platform that the group believes will be fundamental to the scaling of the Voluntary Carbon Market,"" the banks said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hitting a new record high, as a measure of confidence returned to a market unsettled by oil price volatility and Chinese regulatory issues.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 63 points, or 0.2%, at 34,640 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Paradoxically, the market was helped by further signs of nervousness about the near-term growth outlook, which led to bond yields falling to their lowest in some weeks. Lower bond yields typically support the valuations of tech companies and startups, whose long-term returns are more sensitive to low capital costs. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to its lowest since February, at 1.33%. Adjusted for current inflation - admittedly a figure that is itself distorted by various pandemic-related factors - that means that the real yield on Treasuries is below -3%.
Bank stocks underperformed, as the decline in yields threatened to put further pressure on their lending margins. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 0.2%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 0.5% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 1.2%.
The major indices later trimmed their gains after the Labor Department's monthly JOLTs job openings survey fell short of expectations, registering little change in the number of vacancies in May. Analysts had expected another clear rise to what would have been a third straight all-time high. 
Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) ADRs continued their wretched run, shedding another 5.1% amid fears that the ride-hailing giant faces a long and punishing struggle with China's regulators over its data policy, having already angered them with a breakneck dash to market last week. That Didi compressed its marketing period into only three days to ensure a quick placement has raised questions about whether it withheld knowledge of the regulator's plans before they became public at the weekend. Didi's ADRs fell by more than 20% in response to news that regulators had ordered the withdrawal of Didi's app from all Chinese app stores.
In the world of meme stocks, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock continued its slide in the wake of the company cancelling plans for an expansion funded by new equity issuance. The plans had been resisted by some of the cinema operator's vocal retail investors, but the lack of fresh money, combined with growing fears about a fresh surge in coronavirus cases due to the spreading delta variant, pushed it down 13% to its lowest in nearly a month.
Oil and gas stocks meanwhile were hit by a fresh drop in crude prices after a Wall Street Journal report spelled out the determination of the United Arab Emirates - OPEC's third-largest producer - to raise its output. The UAE's resistance to a Russian-Saudi proposal for a series of limited monthly output increases through the rest of the year has raised the risk that individual members of the so-called OPEC+ bloc will start another free-for-all in pursuit of market share. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 3.1%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.0%. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) ADRs (NYSE:RDSa) outperformed after the Anglo-Dutch giant promised earlier to accelerate its program to increase shareholder returns. "

Investing.com – Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) rose more than 2.5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as two banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), reiterated their faith in the company’s stock.
The $280 target at Goldman Sachs represents an upside of almost 29% for the Whirlpool stock. JPMorgan has a $278 target for the consumer durable stock.
Goldman Sachs analyst Susan Maklari tracked appliance prices across four major retailers to better assess the competitive and promotional environment around the July 4 holiday.
The analyst said Whirlpool’s promotional discounts were the least at 6%, down from 10% a year ago.
According to Maklari, lower discounts are positive for the maker of refrigerators and washing machines, given it shows the company is trying to offset higher costs by passing them on to consumers.
JP Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut brushed aside Wall Street’s fears about the company’s margins in North America.
“By contrast, we believe North America’s margins are sustainable at 15% or better, driven by years of improvement in productivity and mix as well as last year’s permanent cost cutting actions, while we estimate Europe’s ongoing turnaround represents at least $2/share of incremental earnings power over the next 2-3 years,” Rehaut wrote in his note.
According to Rehaut, Whirlpool is well placed to ride any slowdown in demand.

The 20-day correlation between futures for the S&P 500 and Treasuries turned negative for the first time since February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While longer-term measures remain positive, it signals a reversal in the recent trend.
The two assets have been increasingly moving in lockstep in past few months, and the link between them jumped to a 2005 high earlier this year. It all stirred anxiety that bonds would fail in their traditional role of protecting portfolios from stock declines.
Treasuries surged in the wake of the latest data for the services sector in the U.S. The numbers missed expectations amid signs of labor shortages and supply-side constraints, handing ammo to those who think the economic rebound from the pandemic may not be smooth.
The yield on 10 year U.S. notes closed 8 basis points lower, taking its drop to more than 17 basis points since the start of last week.
“While the S&P 500 was charging to successive new highs last week, Fed Funds Futures and Treasuries were beginning to flash a yellow light,” Nicholas Colas and Jessica Rabe of DataTrek Research wrote in a note. “It’s too early to call this a full-blown ‘growth scare,’ but we think it’s important that these two markets are less convinced of a 2022 Fed policy shift now than just six trading days ago.”

Group Chief Executive Tony Fernandes told Reuters in a virtual interview that a few SPACs focused on technology have approached the group, and AirAsia has engaged auditors for a deal to list the unit, which comprises a travel and lifestyle services platform, logistics and fintech businesses. 
""We have now recruited our auditors to start preparing for an American listing so that's very much on the table,"" he said, adding that Rothschild is working on the listing that could happen in five months.
The group is also in discussions with other suitors, including Malaysian and Indonesian private equity, Fernandes added.
Mergers and acquisition activity and SPAC deals have surged in Asia, with Southeast Asia's largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab heading for a U.S. listing via a hefty $40 billion merger with a SPAC.
Fernandes, wearing a bright red cap with the words ""Make AirAsia Fly Again"", also said that talks with an U.S. company over a loan of $1 billion for the digital business is also near conclusion, with a term sheet already prepared.
AirAsia had earlier announced that it will buy Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek's Thailand business in a stock swap, giving Gojek a 4.76% stake worth $50 million in the airline's lifestyle platform.
The deal values the AirAsia SuperApp division at around $1 billion, more than the pandemic-hit airline's current market value of $868 million at a time when it has been looking to raise more capital.
AirAsia has been looking since last year to raise up to 2.5 billion ringgit ($600.96 million) to weather the slump in global travel.
Fernandes said the group could announce updates on its financing as soon as next week, and that a government-guaranteed loan was also being processed.

Separately at another virtual briefing, AirAsia said Thai AirAsia will list on the local stock exchange in about three to four months.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 08:56AM ET</span>","Unveiling its last petrol car, Lotus sets off in pursuit of Porsche","By Nick Carey
HETHEL, England (Reuters) - Lotus unveiled its last ever petrol car on Tuesday, a milestone in the British sportscar brand's journey towards becoming an all-electric and far bigger automaker by the end of the decade.
Lotus and its Chinese owner Geely want to transform what is now a tiny company making some 1,500 sports cars a year into an electric powerhouse churning out tens of thousands of high-end saloons and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) as well.
""We recognise we need to increase our revenues and the sports car segment is limited,"" Lotus Managing Director Matt Windle told Reuters. ""So we're looking to offer a variety of Lotus products across the range, for different people in different stages of their lives.""
The expansion plan is not unlike that of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s sportscar brand Porsche, which has expanded greatly since launching its Cayenne SUV in 2002. Porsche sold more than 90,000 Cayennes last year, by far its best seller with almost three times the sales of its most famous car, the 911.
The Lotus project is starting with the Emira, which it unveiled at its Hethel factory on an old air force base in eastern England where it plans to make about 4,800 of the sports cars a year - with the capacity to make more if demand is high.
The Emira, which will start at around 60,000 pounds ($83,000), is the first new petrol Lotus model in more than a decade but it will be the last powered by fossil fuels.
Lotus has designed it to look like a sibling of its Evija, an electric ""hypercar"" that will have a production run of just 130 cars - it's the 130th model in Lotus's 73-year history - and sell for some two million pounds ($2.8 million) each. 
Pointing at the Emira and Evija side by side on the carmaker's studio floor, Russell Carr, head of design at Lotus, said he's looking forward to ""sprinkling some of that fairy dust"" on the company's new ""lifestyle"" models.
Geely bought a 51% stake in Lotus in 2017, ending years of financial struggles for the company under various previous owners that had forced it to shelve some new model launches.
Lotus is now part of a growing empire for the Chinese automaker, which owns Sweden's Volvo Cars and is the biggest shareholder in Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).
DYNAMIC GROWTH POTENTIAL
Geely's founder Li Shufu aims to create a global company built around brands that share technology from a Chinese supply base under unique skins. He has largely left details of how brands execute that strategy in the hands of local managers. 
Geely and Lotus's other shareholder, Malaysia's Etika Automotive, are investing more than $2 billion to expand its production, including a new plant in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the first new Lotus lifestyle models will be built.
""There's a potential for dynamic growth at Lotus,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""But they have to be wary of diluting the Lotus name, because if their new models are not seen as worthy of the name it could hurt the brand globally.""
Design chief Carr said being part of a large auto group has given Lotus access to technology that it would have found difficult to source on its own - such as the dashboard touchscreen in the Emira. 
And in a nod to changing consumer habits, the new sports car will feature a first for Lotus: cup holders.
Managing director Windle also said Geely had approved a Lotus request for its new SUVs and sedans to be built on a platform designed by the British company - rather than sharing underpinnings with Volvo or the all-electric Polestar.
Windle said that would allow Lotus to continue operating as a supplier and engineer for other carmakers, which it has done for years with its Lotus Engineering division. He said several carmakers had shown an interest in the Lotus EV platform. 
Geely wants Lotus Engineering to be a distinct technology outfit within its broader group of companies, pursuing its own self-drive, smart and electric mobility technologies.
Lotus is currently developing an electric sports car platform in partnership with  Renault  (PA:RENA) for the French company's Alpine brand, and that framework will also be available to other carmakers.
Windle acknowledges that branching out into SUVs and sedans presents risks. 

""It is a challenge and it's going away from what we're used to historically,"" he said. ""But then I would argue that our business case hasn't worked historically either.""

Investing.com – Bank shares were muted in Wednesday’s premarket trading amid fears the rising COVID-19 cases could scuttle the revival in the economy.
The outlook for bank earnings has been hit by the marked drop in bond yields in recent weeks, as fears about resurgent inflation have given way to concerns that the economic rebound may be flattening out. Falling bond yields depress banks' lending margins and consequently their profitability.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has fallen below 2% again, while the 10-year
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were down 0.2% each in premarket trading. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was trading 0.4% lower while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were both flat.
Tuesday, Goldman Sachs, at 1.1%, fell the least of the five. Wells Fargo had the biggest fall at 3.5% while others lost 1.6%-2.6%.
While more than half the U.S. population is now vaccinated with at least the first dose, the fast spread of the Delta variant, that first emerged in India, is now creating new anxiety. The market will be looking to see later whether that anxiety has reached the Federal Reserve, which publishes the minutes of its latest policy meeting at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT).
At its last meeting in June, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its estimate for 2021 growth to 7% from the 6.5% estimate issued in March. The central bank's policymakers' 'dot-plot' also hinted at the possibility of two rate hikes in 2023, earlier than the 2024 schedule indicated in March. Many are still skeptical about the timing though."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd has suspended operations of its factories in the state of Selangor due to a two-week enhanced lockdown in the country, the firm said on Wednesday. 
""Top Glove wishes to inform that its medical glove factories in Klang will not be operating temporarily, in compliance with the EMCO (Enhanced Movement Control Order) directive,"" Top Glove said in an emailed response to Reuters. 
The world's largest maker of medical gloves said it was awaiting clarification from the authorities.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said in a statement that critical sectors that support production of healthcare products, food and beverages as well as the global supply chains were allowed to operate in the areas under enhanced movement restrictions. 
It did not specify if glove-makers were allowed to resume operations.
More than half of Top Glove's factories are located in Klang in Selangor.
Malaysia last week imposed tighter restrictions on movement, businesses and factories in the capital Kuala Lumpur and neighbouring Selangor state until July 16 to combat a surge in new coronavirus infections.

""The company looks forward to safely resuming operations at the appropriate time,"" Top Glove said.
Smaller rival Hartalega Holdings, key manufacturer of nitrile gloves for hospitals, in a statement to Reuters said the shutdown of its manufacturing facilities will have a significant impact on both the local and international healthcare value chain.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: What is driving China's clampdown on Didi and data security?,"By Josh Horwitz and Yilei Sun
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's cyberspace regulator has launched a probe into ride-hailing giant Didi Global, calling for it to stop adding new users and for app stores to remove it, days after it went public in a $4.4 billion New York stock sale.
The move, followed by similar actions against two other recently U.S.-listed Chinese firms, comes amid tightening policies around data control and privacy, and a broader crackdown on tech firms.
WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST DIDI?
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on July 2 called for Didi to stop accepting new user registrations, citing China's Cybersecurity Law, a sweeping piece of legislation implemented in 2017.
Two days later, the CAC said Didi's app ""has serious violations of laws and regulations pertaining to the collection of personal information.""
The CAC has not publicly specified the violations.
WHAT USER DATA DOES DIDI COLLECT? 
Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing company, provides 20 million rides a day in China to users who sign up through an app that uses a phone number and password.
Didi collects user location and trip route data, for safety and data analysis. It routinely publishes reports illustrating its big data analytics, showing, for example, what times people in certain cities finish work, or which employers have the longest work hours.
Didi also equips cars with cameras monitoring road conditions, and what is happening in the car, collecting data on 100 billion kilometres of Chinese roads per year.
Didi stores all Chinese user and roads data on domestic servers. A Didi executive said on Saturday it was impossible that it passed data to the United States. 
WHY DID THE CAC TARGET DIDI?
China is in the process of revamping its policy towards privacy and data security. 
In late April, China issued a second version of a draft Personal Information Protection Law, which calls for tech platforms to impose stricter measures to ensure secure storage of user data.
In September, China is set to implement its Data Security Law, which requires companies that process ""critical data"" to conduct risk assessments and submit reports to authorities. It also calls on organizations that process data affecting China's national security to submit to annual reviews.
Michael Tan, who heads the China TMC practice of international law firm Taylor Wessing, says these laws build on the Cybersecurity Law, and the actions against Didi and other companies publicly demonstrate how seriously the government will enforce the new legislation.
In May, the CAC accused 105 apps, including Bytedance’s Douyin and Microsoft’s Bing, of collecting excessive amounts of users’ personal information and illegally accessing it.
WHAT'S WITH THE TIMING?
The move has drawn comparisons to late last year when Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), saw its massive planned Shanghai and Hong Kong IPO thwarted when regulators announced an investigation days before it was due to list.
Some investors and experts suspect that by targeting a high-profile tech company that listed in the United States, Beijing is signaling it wants its data-rich tech firms to list domestically, not overseas, for security reasons.
Late on Tuesday, China's cabinet said Beijing will step up supervision of Chinese firms listed offshore and bolster regulation of cross-border data flows and security.

""When companies go public they need to disclose a lot of detail about how their supply chain actually operates,"" said Nico Bahmanyar, who tracks Chinese data policy at Beijing-based law firm Leaf.
""So if China sees a risk there, it will be easier to control on the Hong Kong stock exchange than the U.S. stock exchange.""

Investing.com – Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) was trading lower in Wednesday’s premarket after the smartphone shipments at the company slipped below 60 million in the second quarter from 76 million in the first, according to various estimates.
Lower demand in India, one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic, and a production suspension in Vietnam due to the coronavirus pandemic are likely to have affected sales.
Samsung (KS:005930) is the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer with 22% of global market share, followed by Apple’s 17%, according to Counterpoint Research.
The Korean company gave its preliminary earnings for the second quarter today.
The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker said profit for the quarter ended June 30 was likely 12.5 trillion won ($11 billion), well above a Refinitiv estimate of 11.3 trillion won, according to Reuters. If confirmed later this month, it would be the tech giant's biggest second-quarter profit since 2018.
The company’s operating profit surged 53% in the second quarter from a year ago. This came on the back of strong demand for memory chips.
Prices of DRAM chips, widely used in servers, mobile phones and other computing devices, jumped 27% compared to the March quarter, according to research provider Trendforce. They're expected to carry on rising in the current quarter.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Wednesday, cautiously rebounding after the previous session’s losses ahead of the release of the keenly awaited minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 70 points, or 0.5%.
Stocks mainly retreated Tuesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 200 points, or 0.6%, and the broad-based S&P 500 ending down 0.2%, ending a seven-day winning run. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, rising nearly 0.2% to a fresh all-time high.
Weighing on sentiment was the release of the ISM non-manufacturing index for June, which showed a slight cooling in the red-hot U.S. services sector, falling to 60.1 from 64.0 the previous month. Chinese ADRs, meanwhile, remain vulnerable to the drip feed of information pointing to a crackdown on U.S. listings.
Stocks have hit record highs in recent days, driven by healthy economic data. While an ISM reading above 60 would normally be seen as indicative of a strong economy, concerns are growing that the recovery is peaking while prices remain elevated due to supply chain disruptions and, in some places, labor costs.
With this in mind, investors will study the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting, at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), for clues on the future direction of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly regarding the tapering of its bond-buying program.
Ahead of that sees the release of the JOLTs job openings survey, at 10 AM ET, which is expected to show 9.388 million vacancies in May, higher than April’s 9.286 million. 
In corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are likely to be in focus after the Pentagon announced it would cancel its decision to award a $10 billion Cloud computing contract. MIcrosoft was the original winner of the tender, but the work is now likely to be divided between the two tech giants.
Crude prices rebounded Wednesday after Tuesday’s volatile session, with initial sharp gains over the failure of a group of major producers to boost production quickly sold into over concerns the disagreement could bring an end to the group’s previous unity over production levels, potentially resulting in millions of additional barrels a day hitting the market.
Also of interest Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimates of crude inventories after the closing bell, with the previous week’s report showing a draw of 8.1 million barrels.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $74.53 a barrel, after settling 2.4% lower Tuesday, its sharpest loss in three weeks, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $75.63, after dropping 3.4% during the previous session.

The company said like-for-like bar and food sales slipped 49% between April 12 and May 16, a period when outdoor dining was permitted albeit with some restrictions, while sales were still down 14.6% between May 17 and July 4 when pubs were fully open. 
Wetherspoon, popularly known as just ""Spoons"", slumped into a first-half loss in March and has had to remove hundreds of employees and raise money to get through the health crisis, which forced its pubs shut all through the key Christmas season last year.

In a trading statement ahead of its quarterly results which are due July 29, the Anglo-Dutch company said the acceleration of its planned distribution policy was due to “strong operational and financial delivery, combined with an improved macroeconomic outlook.”
It said it will increase total shareholder distributions to 20%-30% of cash flow from operations, starting at the Q2 results announcement. It had previously tied a promise of higher payouts to progress in reducing net debt. However, it said on Wednesday that it had 'retired' the target of getting net debt below $65 billion, without saying whether or not it had reached it. 
At the end of the first quarter 2021, Shell’s net debt was $71.3 billion.
The company said that its 2021 cash capex will remain below $22 billion, but noted that it would budget for a rise in working capital. 
Oil prices hit their highest in nearly seven years on Monday after the so-called OPEC+ group of producers failed to agree an output policy beyond July. All other things being equal, that will tighten the global market further. However, prices fell on Tuesday amid concern that the dispute within OPEC over market share could lead to a resumption of last year's price war.

Italian daily newspaper MF reported on Wednesday that Autogrill was weighing a possible alliance with Dufry as an option for future growth. 
""Though Autogrill is always open to assessing any opportunity the market might offer in order to pursue its strategic objectives, as of today no extraordinary operation is being examined by the board of the company,"" Autogrill said in a statement responding to the report.
Duty-free shopping group Dufry also denied the report.
""Autogrill has already denied this and so do we. There is nothing to it at all,"" a Dufry spokesperson said. 
Shares in Autogrill were up 1.5% at 0930 GMT after rising as much as 5% in early trading. The stock was outperforming a slightly positive Milan's all-share index.
Dufry shares were up 3.2% compared to an 0.5% rise in the Swiss performance index.
Benetton's holding company Edizione, which owns 50.1% of Autogrill, declined to comment on the report.
Autogrill, which manages restaurants and bars on motorways and at airports, launched a 600 million euro ($710 million) capital increase in mid-June, which was fully subscribed. 
The Benetton family provided half of the cash to support the catering group, which needed to raise fresh liquidity to cut its financial debt. 
As a result of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the market value of the Italian group has shrunk to 2.5 billion euros, which is less than half of Dufry's current market value.
MF said in its report that in the event of a tie-up with Dufry, the Benettons could significantly cut their stake to make room for new investors. 

Autogrill said last month that under agreements its signed with creditors to ease debt covenants it could only spend on mergers and acquisitions from 2023.

Investing.com – Didi Global  (NYSE:DIDI) stock looked like extending the previous session’s losses on Wednesday, on rising concerns over the fate of American investments exposed to Chinese regulatory actions.
Didi shares were down more than 3.5% in premarket trading. They closed at $12.49 on Tuesday, 19.6% lower from Friday. The shares were issued at $14 apiece and had listed on the NYSE just last week.   
Chinese regulators have increased the scrutiny of their firms listed on U.S. exchanges on concerns over the end-use of the large trove of consumer data they hold.
In its brief statement on Tuesday, China’s State Council said rules for overseas listings will be revised and publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. It also said China will step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets.
As many of those firms are listed on the Nasdaq or the NYSE, Chinese authorities are concerned over the quality and quantum of data these companies are required to share with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other American bodies to comply with the listing norms.
An outcome of that fear has been Chinese regulators asking the internet companies not to onboard new customers and going so far as to tell store apps like WeChat and Alipay to take them off their platform.
Chinese companies have listed abroad outside of regulators’ purview largely through the Variable Interest Entity model. Beijing has never really endorsed it, despite the system being used by virtually every Chinese tech giant to tap foreign investors. Under the structure, corporations transfer profits to an offshore entity with shares that foreign investors can then own.
A Bloomberg report said regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling shares is incorporated outside China. The rules may also require VIEs that have already gone public, like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., to seek approval for stock placings offshore, the people said.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>",Online betting firm 888 says revenues fell after UK reopening,"By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -British online betting firm 888 on Wednesday signalled that a reopening of outdoor venues after coronavirus lockdowns was hurting daily revenues in the country, as people spend less time indoors and online.
Shares in the London-listed firm fell as much as 5% to 392 pence in morning trading as investors looked past news that 888 now expects annual profit to be ""slightly ahead"" of last year and focused instead on a recent dip in revenues in the United Kingdom.
Since May 17, when British retail and leisure spaces reopened to customers, 888's average daily revenues in the UK - its single largest market - had been around 20% lower than revenues earlier in 2021. 
888 also said Poker and Bingo revenues fell year-over-year in the quarter ended June 30.
Overall, its June-quarter revenue jumped 10% to $257 million at constant currency rates.
""The strong momentum from the first quarter of 2021 continued into the second quarter, albeit with the year-on-year growth rate moderating in light of stronger comparables from the prior year,"" 888 Chief Executive Itai Pazner said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out a plan to end COVID restrictions on July 19, which could further hurt the online betting industry as people go outdoors and screen-time dips.
Still, the easing of pandemic-related restrictions has also brought back sporting events, a positive for 888 and rivals such as Entain and Rank Group.
888 is investing more in developing its betting platforms and on marketing to woo more customers. It partnered last month with Sports Illustrated to support its U.S. expansion.
888 had performed well in a ""potentially tricky"" quarter, Peel Hunt analysts said, adding they were confident that the company would benefit from its overseas expansion plans.
888 is set to report interim results on Sept. 1.

""We are keen to have Board matters resolved as soon as possible,"" Myer's acting chairman JoAnne Stephenson said in a statement. 
Lew, whose Premier Investments now owns a 15.77% stake in Myer after buying further shares in the high-street department store chain on Tuesday, has been critical of its management and demanded representation on the board.
Myer's previous chairman Gary Hounsell had to step down last year after he failed to gather support from Premier and the company's second largest shareholder Wilson Asset Management. 
""The Board is focused on ensuring that (Chief Executive Officer) John King and his management team are able to execute the all-important upcoming peak trading period without distraction,"" Stephenson added.

Myer and other brick-and-mortar retailers have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic and have had to depend on millions of dollars in government support.
The 120-year old firm reported a 13% drop in first-half sales in March, mainly due to store closures amid the pandemic.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak is targeting raising more than $1 billion in its IPO, 25% more than previously planned, on indications of strong investor demand for the country's first tech unicorn listing, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Bukalapak, which counts Singapore sovereign investor GIC and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) among its backers, is set to be the biggest local listing in 13 years and the largest ever by a startup in the Southeast Asian country.
The expanded initial public offering (IPO) target size shows investors are keen to get their hands on relatively rare technology sector offerings in a region that boasts a growing consumer class.
It also underscores the companies' hunger for capital as they pursue rapid growth. Regional ride-hailing-to-payments firm Grab sealed a record $40 billion merger with a U.S. special-purpose acquisition company for a U.S. listing. 
The books for Bukalapak's IPO will open this week for about 10 days, and will be followed by a listing in August, said the sources who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
""We are constantly exploring opportunities for the company to continue to grow and develop financially. However, for now, we have not made any decisions,"" Sufintri Rahayu, vice-president for corporate affairs at Bukalapak, said in an email, when asked about the IPO.
Reuters reported last month that the IPO could raise between $500 million and $800 million depending on investor demand and market conditions.
The sources said the 11-year-old startup is likely to be valued at more than $5 billion, doubling its valuation from two years, and is set to sell a stake of about 20% in the IPO.
They said investor demand is mainly from local and regional funds, with interest also coming from newer tech-focused U.S. investors.
LACKLUSTRE IPO MARKET
With a population of 270 million, Southeast Asia's largest economy has one of the world's fastest-growing online shopping sectors and, like elsewhere, the sector has got a boost from stay-at-home consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bukalapak, which in Bahasa means opening a kiosk in the market, trails leaders Tokopedia, Sea Ltd's Shopee and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Lazada in Indonesia's $40 billion e-commerce market measured by gross merchandise value.
Its listing comes ahead of the planned IPO of GoTo - the merged entity of Tokopedia and ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek. Sources have said GoTo is looking to raise at least $2 billion in a pre-IPO funding in the next few months, which will be followed by an Indonesian listing.
""If Bukalapak has a successful IPO, it would increase the confidence of other unicorns to list in Indonesia,"" said Iqbal Darmawan, a Jakarta-based partner at HHP law firm.
Bukalapak and GoTo's planned debuts will boost Indonesia's lacklustre IPO market, which took a further hit in the pandemic, with the total value raised via IPOs falling by more than half in 2020 to $470 million, according to Refinitiv data.
So far this year, the number of listings has halved from 2020 but the value raised has increased to $603 million.

""Large funds and similar type of investors are attracted to tech IPOs as the deal sizes are huge,"" said Darmawan.
Other investors in Bukalapak, which says it has more than 100 million users, include local media conglomerate Emtek and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)'s investment arm.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 05:04AM ET</span>","Samsung Electronics flags 53% jump in Q2 profit, tops estimates","By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd on Wednesday reported a likely 53% jump in second-quarter operating profit, beating market estimates on the back of strong chip prices and demand despite lower smartphone sales.
The preliminary result is up 33% from the first quarter and underscores the soaring demand for chips that has depleted stockpiles amid a pandemic-led consumer appetite for electronics and recovering investment in data centres. 
The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker said profit for the quarter ended June 30 was likely 12.5 trillion won ($11 billion), well above a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 11.3 trillion won. If confirmed later this month, it would be the tech giant's biggest second-quarter profit since 2018. 
""Third-quarter profit is expected to be even higher on strong mobile DRAM memory chip prices, and peak seasons for mobile and display businesses,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. 
For the second quarter, Samsung (KS:005930)'s chip division profit likely jumped by a fifth or more from a year earlier, analysts said, helped by strong memory-chip prices and demand for consumer electronics and from data centre customers. 
Samsung's memory chip shipments, especially for DRAM chips widely used in servers, mobile phones and other computing devices, were larger than expected, contributing to chip profits that dwarfed a steep quarter-over-quarter fall in smartphone shipments.
Improved yield in cutting-edge 1z nanometre DRAM chip production using ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines also likely lessened costs from the first quarter, analysts said.
Profits at Samsung's chip contract manufacturing and logic chip design businesses were likely to have improved too as operations at a storm-hit factory in Texas returned to normal, analysts said. 
""One of the most-anticipated elements in the earnings call later this month is how much the chip contract manufacturing business has progressed in competitiveness, and the current status of foundry customers and orders,"" said Lee Won-sik, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. 
""Another is what changes Samsung expects in memory chip profitability, as competitors like Micron are said to be narrowing the technology gap (with Samsung),"" Lee added. 
Last month, U.S. memory chip rival Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates, and forecast current-quarter revenue above expectations.
SMARTPHONE SHIPMENTS
Samsung's smartphone shipments fell to about 59 million in April-June from about 76 million in the first quarter, according to Shinyoung Investment & Securities, as sales of its flagship model launched in the first quarter slowed. 
New COVID-19 outbreaks in regions such as India and Vietnam, as well as constrained supply of mobile processor chips, also hurt smartphone shipments in the quarter, analysts said. These conditions are likely to improve in the second half, they added.
A one-off gain for Samsung's display unit, which analysts said was a compensation from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for previously ordering fewer components than agreed upon, was also included in the quarterly profit. 
Revenue rose an estimated 19% from the same period a year earlier to 63 trillion won, Samsung said. 
Samsung shares fell 1% in morning trade, while the wider market fell 0.7%. Samsung shares have traded nearly flat so far this year versus a 15% rise in the benchmark KOSPI. 

Samsung released only limited data in Wednesday's regulatory filing ahead of the release of detailed earnings figures later this month.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc closed flat it its $1.8 billion Hong Kong dual primary listing on Wednesday as the company said it would develop future models based on product platforms designed for international markets.
Xpeng shares closed at HK$165, in line with its listing price, after rising by as much as 2.1% higher soon after starting trading.
The positive tone was short-lived and the shares dropped to be 3.5% below the offer price before recovering in the afternoon session.
The flat close compared with a 0.4% fall in the benchmark Hang Seng Index and a 1.2% drop in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index <.HSCE
Led by former  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) executive He Xiaopeng, the seven year-old automaker is developing smart-car technologies including a smart cabin and autonomous driving. It is selling P7 and P5 sedans and G3 sport-utility vehicles. 
Xpeng will roll out a new product platform with which it can develop several models of different segmentations and sizes, in two years, He told Reuters in an interview.
""The platform will be targeting the global market, meaning we will consider global auto regulations when we develop it,"" He said. Like rivals Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and BYD, Xpeng is expanding global sales by shipping cars to Norway, where policies are supportive of EVs.
Xpeng is making its cars in two Chinese factories and is building two new plants. It is adding production hours at Zhaoqing, He said. Its prospectus shows Xpeng is planning an SUV model next year.
""Between 2025 and 2030, China's auto industry might look like the current smartphone industry, which a few players dominate,"" He, who previously founded a smartphone software company, said.
Xpeng will continue developing smart-car technologies, as well as a flying car that would also be able to drive on roads, He said, without giving a timeframe. The company already has a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) prototype that is undergoing testing. 
Xpeng chose a dual primary listing rather than a secondary listing as it has been listed in New York for less than two years. The dual primary listing allows qualified Chinese investors to take part through the Stock Connect regime linking the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, according to the exchange's rules.

LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on Smartkarma, said the stock's debut ""looks a little weak"" although this was expected given broader market weakness. 
""Seems like just another indicator that it might not be possible to keep extracting capital from investors at the rates that were happening in 2019 and 2020,"" he said.

Shares in PageGroup and Robert Walters rose as much as 6% each in morning trade following the news.
Recruiting firms globally suffered last year as the pandemic forced most businesses to halt hiring, but COVID-19 vaccinations and the re-opening of some economies have encouraged firms to resume recruiting.
Both PageGroup and Robert Walters, which each operate in more than 30 countries, reported higher June-quarter profits from a year earlier but struck a cautiously optimistic tone in their respective statements on Wednesday.
""At this stage of the recovery, it is not easy to determine whether the improved performance is still the result of pent-up supply and demand, or a sustainable trend,"" PageGroup Chief Executive Officer Steve Ingham said in a statement.
PageGroup's German business saw a ""record quarter"" and its technology-focused business also benefited from pandemic-driven trends around remote work, the company said.
Within Britain, London was a bright spot for Robert Walters, which noted strong recruitment activity across the commerce, finance, legal and technology sectors.
PageGroup, which helps hire executives, professionals and clerical staff, now expects annual operating profit of between 125 million-135 million pounds ($173 million-186 million), up from a prior estimate of 90 million to 100 million pounds.
Robert Walters projected annual profit be ""significantly ahead"" of the level it guided in June.
Page's June-quarter gross profit rose 2% compared to the same period in 2019 before the pandemic, while Robert Walters reported its first profit rise in a year.

With hiring gaining steam, their consultant headcount also increased to deal with the rise in demand for their services, they said.

The lawsuit, filed by the VZBV at a regional court in Stuttgart, seeks to set a precedent that would enable owners of Mercedes GLC and GLK cars to gain compensation over software that was allegedly used to trick emissions tests.
""Those who may have been affected will obtain certainty over whether Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) deliberately installed illegal defeat devices in several vehicle models,"" VZBV chief Klaus Mueller said in a statement.
""Despite official recalls, Daimler AG to this day denies it deliberately manipulated the emissions of its cars. The Stuttgart regional court should declare this. That would bring legal clarity for many consumers who have been affected.""
Daimler said it considered emissions litigation against it to be baseless and would contest the case brought by the VZBV.
The VZBV estimates that a total of 254,000 Mercedes vehicles were recalled in Germany. Its so-called Musterfeststellungsklage - or Model Declaratory Action - covers nearly 50,000 Mercedes GLC and GLK models.
The recall was ordered in 2018 and the VZBV said it was filing its case before Daimler's potential legal liability expires after a three-year period has elapsed.

Daimler has not admitted wrongdoing in the matter, which is part of the wider 'Dieselgate' emissions scandal that has cost rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in vehicle refits, fines and legal costs.

KUALA LUMPUR/BANGKOK (Reuters) -Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia Group said it will buy Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek's Thailand business in a stock swap, giving Gojek a 4.76% stake in the airline's lifestyle platform.
AirAsia will acquire Gojek's business in return for $50 million worth of shares in AirAsia SuperApp, valuing the division at around $1 billion, more than the pandemic-hit airline's current market value of $868 million at a time when it has been looking to raise more capital.
The agreement with the Indonesian startup unicorn comes just a week after AirAsia applied for a digital banking licence in Malaysia, signalling a shift in focus towards digital business as most of its fleet remains grounded amid coronavirus restrictions.
""By taking on Gojek's well-established Thai business, we'll be able to turbo-charge our ambitions in this space,"" AirAsia Chief Executive Tony Fernandes said in a statement.
AirAsia SuperApp offers travel, e-commerce and financial services and is one of three companies under the AirAsia Digital group. The others are logistics venture Teleport and the BigPay fintech business.
AirAsia could give Gojek a boost in Thailand where the startup has lagged food delivery and ride-hailing competitors, said Nattabhorn Juengsanguansit, director at Thai business consultancy Asia Group Advisors.
""But the venture faces stiff competition in food delivery from the likes of Line Man, which received a major capital boost last year. (Singapore's) Grab has strong position in ride-hailing and Estonia's Bolt is growing its market share,"" she said.
Gojek's Thai business, which includes ride-hailing, food delivery and payments, is its smallest overseas operation and has a far smaller share of that market than food delivery leader Grab.
Gojek will focus on increasing investment in Vietnam and Singapore after the deal is completed, the statement said.
""We looked at where we could really commit the resources in order to ensure that our teams have a path towards market leadership, and we see that in Vietnam and Singapore, and hence our commitment there is as strong if not stronger than ever,"" Gojek CEO Kevin Aluwi told reporters.
Gojek's plans for an initial public offering were proceeding though the focus on the two markets was not directly related to its IPO pursuit, he added.
Gojek's Thai business made a loss in 2019 and 2020, according to accounts provided with the deal announcement.
Nikkei Asia earlier reported that AirAsia was in talks with Gojek to acquire its Thai business.
Fernandes told reporters that BigPay was near closing a transaction while the group could be making announcements on its fundraising initiatives next week. He did not share details.
""AirAsia will be making some announcements, I hope, next week, regarding financing and ... the Danajamin loan is being processed as we speak,"" he said, referring to a government-guaranteed loan the airline has sought for months.
Fernandes in March told a local weekly that the airline could secure 1 billion ringgit ($240.62 million) in bank loans and in April the group expects to see clarity on its fundraising in two to three months.

AirAsia has been looking since last year to raise up to 2.5 billion ringgit to weather the pandemic-induced slump in global travel.

LONDON (Reuters) -Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) will boost returns to shareholders via share buybacks or dividends earlier than expected after a sharp rise in oil and gas prices helped it reduce debt, the Anglo-Dutch energy firm said on Wednesday.
Shell will increase its distribution to shareholders to 20% to 30% of cash flow from operations beginning in the second quarter, the company said in a trading statement before quarterly results.
The move, which comes earlier than many analysts had expected, was due to ""strong operational and financial delivery, combined with an improved macroeconomic outlook."" [O/R]
Shell's London-traded shares were up 2.2% by 0758 GMT, compared with a 1.2% gain for the broader European energy index.
Shell previously said it would boost returns once its net debt dropped below $65 billion. The company said on Wednesday it would ""retire"" the target without specifying whether it had hit it.
""In the second quarter, Shell expects to have further reduced its net debt, although the extent of the reduction will be moderated by working capital movements,"" it said.
Analysts had largely expected Shell to increase distribution towards the end of the year, but a strong rise in oil and natural gas prices in recent months accelerated the timetable.
The shareholder returns increase ""is an important milestone that highlights the strength of Shell's free cashflow proposition and sends an important message to the market,"" JP Morgan analyst Christyan Malek said in a note.
In the first quarter, the company raised its dividend after profits rose to $3.23 billion.
Shell, which is in the midst of a strategic shift to lower its greenhouse gas emissions, said it would stick to its spending plans that would remain below $22 billion in 2021.

Despite the higher oil and gas prices, Shell said its liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading operations, the world's largest, were ""significantly below average"" in the second quarter and similar to the previous quarter.
Oil products sales are expected to be between 4 million to 5 million barrels per day, still well below pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened higher Wednesday, stabilizing after Tuesday’s sharp selloff, but investors remain cautious about the strength of the global recovery and the threat of the delta Covid variant.
By 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 and the broader Stoxx 600 index were both up by 0.5%. The OMX Copenhagen 20 and Germany’s DAX led the way with gains of 1.0% and 0.7% respectively.
Stock markets around the globe have been on a tear for much of the year, helped by successful vaccination programs and vast amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
However, this enthusiasm is showing signs of waning. All three major European indices dropped by around 1% on Tuesday, not helped by German ZEW economic sentiment falling by much more than expected. Also, the broad-based S&P 500 broke a seven-day winning streak on Wall Street after the ISM non-manufacturing PMI, a key gauge of service-sector activity, fell more than expected, raising worries that the U.S. economy may be approaching a peak.
Fears about the economic outlook were assuaged, at least partly, by some encouraging corporate updates: Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock rose over 3% after the oil and gas giant said it will accelerate its program of returns to shareholders in the light of better cash flow. Italian payments firm Nexi (MI:NEXII) hit an all-time high after its merger plan with Danish-based Nets received regulatory clearance, and heavily-weighted software giant SAP (DE:SAPG) rose over 3.7% after Bank of America put it on its ‘buy’ list with a price target of 150 euros, some 25% above Tuesday's close.
Economic data were less supportive: German industrial production fell 0.3% in May, a lot weaker than the 0.5% growth expected, and U.K. house prices fell for the first time in five months, according to lender Halifax. However, most eyes will be on the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes later Wednesday.
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Wednesday after the previous session’s wild ride during which traders digested the failure of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to agree a deal to boost production.
This outcome initially resulted in sharp gains, with the Nymex contract climbing to its highest in nearly seven years. However, this enthusiasm quickly turned to concern that the spat between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over future output levels could lead to a fresh fight for market share, in an echo of last year's price war.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $74.07 a barrel, after settling 2.4% lower Tuesday, its sharpest loss in three weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $75.11, after dropping 3.4% during the previous session.

The company's Partnerships business delivers buildings in partnership with housing associations, public bodies andinstitutional private rental operators, while its Housebuilding unit is focused on building private homes for owner-occupiers in the Home Counties region, the area comprising counties surrounding London.
The decision follows a strategic review of the potential separation of the Housebuilding business. The company said a new Partnerships region will be established to serve the Home Counties.
""The value of the additional recurring earnings that this (strategy) will generate, along with the 450 million pounds ($621.2 million) proceeds from the disposal of surplus assets, clearly significantly exceeds the value of any of the other strategic options available"" Chairman John Martin said in a statement.
The FTSE Midcap firm said its board expects the new Partnerships business in Home Counties to generate financial returns consistent with the rest of Partnerships over time and forecast annualised adjusted operating profit of at least 60 million pounds by 2023.
The company also said it intends to change its name to Countryside Partnerships Plc.

President Vladimir Putin, in the latest step to protect Russian products, signed a law on Friday requiring all foreign makes of sparkling wines to use that description on the back of their bottles, although labels on the front can stay the same.
The law, which aims to protect ""shampanskoye"" by giving it a unique status and exempting it from the rule, has sparked outcry in France, which jealously guards ""champagne"" produced from its Champagne region as a unique product that differs from anything made in other French regions or the rest of the world.
Pavel Titov, the president of Abrau-Durso and co-owner with his father, told Reuters that he did not believe the new law would change the level of competition in Russia's market.
""We are in completely different price segments - imported French champagne is many times more expensive,"" he said.
Shares in Abrau-Durso, which last year renamed its ""Russkoye shampanskoye"" brand ""Russkoye igristoe"", or Russian sparkling, were trading up 0.5% on the day on Tuesday and at one point almost 9% up since the start of the week.
Abrau-Durso exports its wines to 24 countries but not France, Titov said.
Titov had told French media on Saturday he hoped the issue, which led some in the French champagne industry to urge producers to halt shipments to Russia, would be resolved in favour of global norms and standards.
Some French champagne producers have said they would comply with the law to keep access to Russia's market.

Financial market sources told Reuters in May the company was considering an IPO as early as this summer and could raise about $500 million.

1422,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",Nike Shares Lose Out to Chinese Sneaker Rivals After Xinjiang Cotton Boycott,"(Bloomberg) -- A wave of patriotic buying fueled by the Xinjiang cotton controversy is helping shares of Chinese sportswear makers outperform global peers.
Chinese consumer support in response to the alleged human-rights issues in Xinjiang region has boosted some local sneaker makers by some 275% this year. A Bloomberg gauge of Hong Kong-listed apparel and retail stocks touched the highest level since 2015. Meanwhile,  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) have risen less than 15%.
Rising geopolitical tensions over accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang have become a serious threat for global companies trying to operate in China. Firms like Anta Sports Products Ltd. and Li Ning Co., which have supported using materials from the contentious far west region, have gained market share as the Chinese switch away from foreign brands expressing concern.
“There is definitely some bitter aftertaste among Chinese consumers since the Xinjiang cotton boycott,” said Catherine Lim, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The issue has helped raise the profile of homegrown brands like Anta and Li Ning, she added.
While Nike recently posted better-than-expected results as sporting events and consumer spending ramp back up, the $250 billion U.S. juggernaut is still struggling in China, where sales of western brands have cooled since March. The shift in local preference to Chinese products may get a further push in the runup to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, for which Anta will be an official supplier.
“The sentiment to buy homegrown brands will continue,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “In the short-term, the stock prices of Li Ning and Anta will continue to rise.”
Anta, which owns rights to the Fila brand in the region, has climbed to a series of record highs, pushing its market value to over $60 billion. Li Ning, a company founded by a gold-medal winning Olympic gymnast, has seen its shares jump more than 65%.
The gains for smaller rivals have been even more eye-popping, with 361 Degrees International Ltd. and Xtep International Holdings Ltd. having more than tripled.
Shares of Xtep jumped as much as 9.3% to a record high Wednesday, while Li Ning climbed as much as 5.8%, 361 Degrees 5.4% and Anta 2.3%. The stocks were probably rising on positive sentiment ahead of Anta’s Investor Day on Thursday, according to Edward Lui, an analyst at Bocom International.
UOB Kay Hian’s Leung warned that the picture may change after the announcement of first-half earnings, as investors may seek cheaper shares with some Chinese sportswear stocks looking expensive. Li Ning is trading at 55 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, while Anta is at 44 times. Nike and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) trade at around 35 times.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 02:31AM ET</span>","Solarwatt flexes muscles in home energy storage fight with Shell, Tesla","By Vera Eckert
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Solarwatt, backed by BMW's billionaire shareholder Stefan Quandt, plans to launch a small module that lets homeowners link rooftop solar panels to power storage batteries and electric vehicles to cut costs.
The wallbox allows home owners to control when and how much home-produced photovoltaics (PV) power they store, use to charge their electric vehicles (EVs), or sell to the grid.
The move takes aim at Shell-owned sonnen, China's BYD, Germany's E3/DC, EnBW's Senec, LG Chem, Varta and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which EuPD Research says dominate the home storage market.
""The energy manager is the brain of the home,"" Peter Bachmann, Solarwatt's Vice President Customer Solutions, told Reuters ahead of a launch planned for Wednesday.
""It distributes the power from the roof intelligently.""
The Manager Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) device, which looks like a wifi router and will go on sale at around 500 euros ($594), allows the integration of energy flows and gadgets at home, such as rooftop panels, batteries, electric heat pumps and EV-charging boxes.
It follows a home storage battery deal with BMW last month, and Solarwatt, also active in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain and Australia, aims to be a top five player by the end of 2022, Bachmann said.
By bringing the power and car sectors closer, Quandt, who owns nearly half of BMW with his sister Susanne Klatten, is taking a page from Tesla's strategy book, with products ranging from solar roof installations to cars.
""We are showing that we have a holistic way of thinking in our DNA,"" Quandt, who owns a majority of Solarwatt, said last month.
Germany is an obvious starting point. With 300,000 stationary batteries, it is the world's top home storage market, ahead of the United States, Japan and Australia.
Germany's battery market has grown tenfold since 2015 and is set for 60% growth this year, fuelled by its 16 million house owners, of which two million operate solar panels.
Energy components and management systems in the home must be digitally linked to allow customers to monitor production, usage and prices, and to engage with the grid.
Heating and cooling suppliers such as Viessmann or solar inverter maker SMA are also active, developing steering devices and drawing customers into virtual communities.
""The decisive factor will be who gets to supply the entire household system from photovoltaics to storage batteries and (EV) wall boxes,"" said Andreas Radics, partner at Berylls Strategy Advisors.
Currently, it costs 7 euro cents to produce a kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar power in Germany, a fifth of grid power.
A household installing panels for generation, an electric heat pump to replace oil or gas boilers, and buying an EV instead of a petrol-based car can cut its CO2 emissions by 89%, it said.
That is if you can afford it.
A PV and battery system together may cost around 15,000 euros, an electric heating system another 10,000 euros, and an electric car 30,000-40,000 euros, although savvy buyers can make use of state support programmes to almost halve the bills.
For those not responding to incentives, Berlin has introduced punitive legislation such as a new CO2 tax on heat and car fuels as EV car registrations passed the 1 million mark this week, with up to 10 million expected by 2030.
""The ramp-up of EV sales will directly induce a corresponding run on smart energy products in the household sphere,"" said PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Steffen Apfel.
Sonnen's CEO Oliver Koch said EVs are driving demand for the company's PV systems and batteries: ""A third of buyers (of those segments) add a charging device for their EV,"" he said.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Manufacturers, meantime, are eyeing the household sector because of technological dynamics that bring synergy between stationary and EV batteries, but more importantly because that's where their customers are.
Like rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), BMW faces a loss of revenues tied to combustion engines, forcing it to scout for new areas of future profitability.
EV makers have started exploring links between EVs and home power circuits, to morph home and car electricity into one, and between EVs and grids, to offer stability services and recycle used batteries.
It is in their interest that wall boxes are supplied with solar power, as this supports the EV's green footprint.
If they were filled up from public grids, EVs would necessarily have to absorb a current share of 50% fossil and nuclear fuels.

""(Germany's) 10 million EVs target can only be achieved if the industry can make the customer a sustainable offer,"" a BMW spokesperson said.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2021 02:07AM ET</span>","Property, cash and Amazon: Why buyout firms are battling to buy UK’s Morrisons","By James Davey and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -At least three private equity groups armed with foreign cash have lined up to do battle over Morrisons, a British supermarket with a big property portfolio and a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that could help scale-up its lagging online offering.
Interest in the chain, which has recently notched up market share in Britain's cut-throat grocery business, partly reflects private equity's new-found passion for UK Plc, as the nation rebounds faster than expected from Brexit and the COVID-19 crisis.
Yet Britain's No. 4 grocer may offer more potential than some rivals. Alongside a big property portfolio and strong cash generation, Morrisons supplies Amazon Prime members with same-day food deliveries.
'Morrisons on Amazon' now accounts for over 10% of sales in the majority of Morrisons stores where it is offered. The tie-up is helping a chain that has been a laggard in the booming online market. And that alliance adds to the attraction for a buyer.
New York-based Apollo said on Monday it was weighing an offer for the chain, which began 122 years ago as a market stall in the northern English city of Bradford.
Its interest was announced after a group led by Fortress, owned by Japan's SoftBank, agreed terms for an $8.7 billion offer. Last month, an unsolicited proposal from U.S. group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) was rejected. 
ONLINE LINK-UP
The Amazon deal dates back to 2016, when the world's biggest retailer linked up with Morrisons to gain a foothold in Britain, the world's second-biggest market for online food retail.
Morrisons is unique among British supermarkets in making half of the fresh food it sells, so it can provide wholesale supplies to Amazon, while also packing orders that the U.S. online giant delivers to its Amazon Prime customers.
The deal has sparked speculation that Amazon could buy Morrisons to turbocharge its own offering in Britain's food business, a fiercely competitive sector worth 212 billion pounds ($294 billion) a year.
But one investor in British supermarkets, who asked not to be named, said Amazon would still have to make a case for such a acquisition. ""If I was an Amazon shareholder I'd want to know why that is preferable to some of the other things they could spend their money on,"" he said.
Amazon, which declined to comment, has previously said it kept its options for investments in Britain under review. It already owns 12.6% of British takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo.
The Morrisons battle is part of a broader revaluation of British assets, weighed down for years by uncertainty about Britain's exit from the European Union but with the outlook now clearer after new trade arrangements began in January.
The world's top private equity groups, flush with cash after largely sitting out the pandemic when markets were volatile, now believe they can price assets, even with limited visibility on the recovery. And Britain, they believe, is looking cheap.
MORE M&A IN UK PLC
London-listed companies are undervalued compared to U.S. and European peers, with the FTSE 100 trading on average at 13 times the 12-month forward earnings of its companies, while the S&P500 trades at 21 times and the STOXX 600 at 17 times.
Merger and acquisitions hit a record high in the seven-months to July 5, with deals worth $181.7 billion targeting British firms, Refinitiv data showed. Deals led by private equity firms to take British firms private surged to an all-time peak of $27.7 billion, after plunging to a record low of $1.1 billion in the same period last year amid the depths of the COVID crisis.
The race for Morrisons began three months after private equity group TDR with investors Zuber and Mohsin Issa completed their purchase of Asda, the UK's No. 3 supermarket.
Asda's new owners merged its petrol stations with their existing fuel business and sold distribution assets to real estate investors to help finance the deal.
Morrisons had free cash flow of 238 million pounds in the financial year before the pandemic, which private equity tends to value more than public markets.
In addition, the acquirer of Morrisons, which owns 85% of its nearly 500 stores, could look to sell and lease back property to generate cash after a deal goes through.
MAKING A BETTER BUSINESS
But such a strategy might not win a broad welcome.
""If an acquirer makes strong returns this should come from making the company a better business,"" said Andrew Koch, senior fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, Morrisons' No. 8 shareholder according to Refinitiv data.
""It should not come from buying its property portfolio too cheaply, levering the company up with debt, and potentially reducing the tax paid to the Exchequer,"" he said, adding Morrisons should declare the value of its stores and distribution centres.
Britain's opposition Labour Party and unions have already voiced concerns about a hit to jobs and investment, although a spokesman for Britain's Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said takeover proposals were a commercial matter.
Fortress, whose offer has been recommended to shareholders by the Morrisons board, has pledged to retain the grocer's headquarters, management and strategy. It also said material store sale or leaseback transactions were not planned.
Britain's farmers union said it was encouraged.
Morrison's 15th largest investor abrdn, formerly  Standard Life  (LON:ABDN) Aberdeen, described the Fortress offer of 254 pence a share as ""good value"". But the supermarket's No. 10 shareholder JO Hambro wants nearer 270p.

Investors could be tested on their commitments to good governance were another suitor to offer a higher price without giving commitments on jobs, debt levels, investment or property.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday, after the previous session’s sharp selloff, but investors remain cautious about the strength of the global recovery, the threat of the delta Covid variant and the potential for central bank tightening. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
Stock markets around the globe have been on a tear for much of the year, helped by successful vaccination programs and vast amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
However, this enthusiasm is showing signs of waning. All three major European indices dropped by around 1% on Tuesday, not helped by German ZEW economic sentiment falling by much more than expected. Also, the broad-based S&P 500 index broke a seven-day winning streak on Wall Street after the ISM non-manufacturing PMI, a key gauge of service-sector activity, fell more than expected, raising worries that the U.S. economy may be approaching a peak.
Also causing concern is the ongoing spread of the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus. A study published over the weekend in Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, showed a decrease in the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing infections and symptomatic illness, suggesting it is less effective against the latest dominant strain of the virus.
German industrial production fell 0.3% in May, a lot weaker than the 0.5% growth expected, but most eyes will be on the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes later Wednesday. 
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Wednesday after the previous session’s wild ride during which traders digested the failure of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to agree a deal to boost production.
This outcome initially resulted in sharp gains, with the Nymex contract climbing to its highest in nearly seven years. However, this enthusiasm quickly turned to concern that the spat between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over future output levels could lead to a fresh fight for market  share, in an echo of last year's price war. 
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $73.67 a barrel, after settling 2.4% lower Tuesday, its sharpest loss in three weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $74.75, after dropping 3.4% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,801.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1831.

Investing.com – Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker  Xpeng  Inc. (HK:9868) fluctuated in its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchnge on Wednesday.
Xpeng's Hong Kong shares held steady at HK$163.6 ($21.06) by 11:50 PM ET (3:50 AM GMT), after they opened up 1.8% from their initial public offering (IPO) price.
The EV company raised $1.8 billion by selling 85 million shares at HK$165 apiece in its secondary listing in Hong Kong. Previously, it raised $1.5 billion in its U.S. IPO in August 2020.
Its Hong Kong debut comes as China’s regulator is tightening oversight of data security and overseas listings. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, the Chinese version of Uber (NYSE:UBER), was removed from the app stores earlier this week just days after its U.S. IPO.
“China’s regulatory probe of Didi Chuxing may put tech-savvy automakers on alert that the gathering and analytics of vehicle operating data, which could become their next big source of profits, will fall under stricter government oversight,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Steve Man and Joanna Chen said in a note.
Xpeng is the first EV company to finish a so-called homecoming IPO. Apart from Xpeng, other U.S.-listed Chinese EV makers, including Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), are also reportedly planning to go public in Hong Kong.
“As a China consumer brand, we want to have our customers ultimately be our shareholders as well, so coming to Hong Kong gives an opportunity to achieve that goal,” Xpeng President Brian Gu told Bloomberg. It also gives “us direct access to China-based investors, which are important for us in the long run,” he added.

A slew of U.S.-traded Chinese firms have been selling shares in Hong Kong, giving them a hedge against the risk of being kicked off American exchanges while broadening their investor base closer to home.
“As a China consumer brand, we want to have our customers ultimately be our shareholders as well, so coming to Hong Kong gives an opportunity to achieve that goal,” XPeng President Brian Gu said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. It also gives “us direct access to China-based investors, which are important for us in the long run,” he said.
Still, unlike many other homecoming listings in Hong Kong since it eased rules on companies with weighted voting rights, XPeng has gone public via a dual primary rather than a secondary listing.
A secondary listing requires a track record of having been traded in another exchange for at least two years, and generally involves less paperwork for the issuer, as well as allows it to just meet U.S. rules to list. One of XPeng’s American depositary shares is equivalent to two ordinary shares in Hong Kong.
XPeng has yet to turn a profit, pledging to break even by late 2023 or early 2024. Revenue has been increasing, however, reaching 2.95 billion yuan ($455 million) in the first quarter, with deliveries in June growing 617% compared to the same month a year earlier.
The automaker said in its listing prospectus that it plans to use the proceeds from its Hong Kong share sale to expand its product portfolio and develop more advanced technologies, among other targets. It is also planning to expand its presence in international markets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). were joint sponsors for the Hong Kong offering.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday released a confidential Trump administration report that was the basis for the former president's threats in 2019 to impose tariffs on imported automobiles on grounds of national security.
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump in May 2019 declared that some unidentified imported autos posed national security risks. He refused to release the report to Congress or the public, which prompted a lawsuit seeking its disclosure.
Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who drafted legislation to require the report's release, said in a statement that ""a quick glance confirms what we expected: The justification for these tariffs was so entirely unfounded that even the authors were too embarrassed to let it see the light of day.""
Trump threatened but never imposed tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars or auto parts. Automakers said tariffs would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, raise vehicle prices and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.
The redacted 116-page report said research and spending by the largest foreign-owned automobile producers reflected de facto subsidies in their home markets, citing Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
""Significant import penetration over the course of the past three decades has severely weakened the U.S. automotive industry,"" the report said. 
This ""jeopardizes U.S. military leadership and its ability to fulfill America’s defense requirements,"" it said. 

American-owned producers are General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the report said. It did not include Chrysler which is part of Stellantis NV.
The release is the latest reversal by the Biden administration of a Trump-era decision. President Joe Biden has taken a more conciliatory approach with some U.S trading partners.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's socialist president-in-waiting expects mining firms enjoying high metals prices to be won over to ""prudent"" plans to hike taxes on mineral resources, a top adviser told Reuters on Tuesday.
In a sign that the gap between the business sector in the world's no. 2 copper producer and the incoming leftist government is closing, Pedro Francke, Castillo's economic adviser, said he expected firms would not oppose a planned review of tax rules after dozens of meetings with businesses.
Castillo is set to be confirmed president after a review of ballots from the June 6 vote. The political novice and former teacher has rattled Peru's elite with plans to redraft the constitution and sharply hike taxes on miners he once said had ""plundered"" the country's wealth.
But as he has approached power Castillo has moderated his rhetoric, and Francke has also sought to calm market concerns. He told Reuters he had held dozens of virtual meetings in recent weeks with domestic and foreign investors and some business leaders from the mining sector.
""In general, a good dialogue has been established, in which a significant part of the concerns they had have been eliminated, and I think there is a lot of openness,"" he said by telephone.
""The mining sector isn't close-minded to new revisions of the taxation system, if done with prudence,"" said Francke, adding those he had talked with saw the plans as ""reasonable"" given high global metal prices.
Peru's mining chamber was not immediately available to comment.
Francke added that he believed it was important to take care to not ""kill"" incentives for mining and ensure funds raised were well spent. Castillo has previously talked about hiking taxes as high as 70% on mining profits.
Castillo has also proposed to review contracts with mining companies that lock in tax rates in the longer term. Francke said talks were planned with the firms and any agreement would ""strictly depend on the acceptance of these companies.""
Peru has such agreements with six mining companies, among them China's MMG Ltd, Aluminum Corp of China, and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), which has a Peru copper project set to come online from 2022.

Francke said that Castillo was open to dialogue with business leaders and would respect pledges he had made, including to protect private property and private investment.
Castillo has a lead of some 44,000 votes ahead of right-wing Keiko Fujimori, though the run-off election result has yet to be officially confirmed, with electoral authorities reviewing disputed ballots after challenges by Fujimori.

By Tony Munroe and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will step up supervision of Chinese firms listed offshore, its cabinet said on Tuesday, days after Beijing launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc on the heels of its U.S. stock market listing.
Under the new measures, China will improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China's cabinet said in a statement.
China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and control leverage ratios, it said.
China's shift against companies listed overseas is a significant move in a sweeping clampdown on its massive and once-freewheeling online ""platform economy"".
U.S. capital markets have been a lucrative source of funding for Chinese firms over the past decade but the risk of additional scrutiny may now deter domestic firms from listing there.
Earlier on Tuesday, Didi shares slumped as much as 25% in U.S. pre-market trade ahead of their first session since the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the company's app be removed from app stores in the country just days after its $4.4 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
U.S.-listed Chinese companies including Full Truck Alliance and Kanzhun Ltd were also set to open lower on Tuesday after the CAC on Monday announced cybersecurity investigations into their affiliated businesses.
""Crackdown on Didi opens a new front in China's tech assertiveness: this is now a question of sovereignty,"" investment research provider TS Lombard's China economist Rory Green wrote in a note.
""The battle for data sovereignty is beginning and China is already fully mobilized. It is increasingly clear that governments around the world have recognized the importance of data and the need to regulate the utility like private firms that control its production and flow.""
In March, the U.S. securities regulator began a rollout of rules to exclude foreign companies from U.S. exchanges if they did not comply with U.S. auditing standards, a move aimed at removing Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges if they fail to comply with U.S. auditing standards for three straight years.
In May, Reuters reported that Beijing was pressing audio platform Ximalaya to drop U.S. listing plans and opt for Hong Kong instead, with one source at the time citing Beijing's growing concerns that U.S. regulators will potentially gain greater access to audit documents of New York-listed Chinese companies.
A record $12.5 billion, in 34 deals, has been raised so far in 2021 from Chinese firms listing in the United States, Refinitiv data shows, including Didi, which started trading on June 30.

Several big U.S.-listed Chinese companies, however, including internet giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), have issued shares in Hong Kong in the past two years.
U.S. exchanges have long been popular listing venues for Chinese tech firms attracted by deep liquidity, high valuations, easier profitability rules and prestige.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 07:11PM ET</span>",Corporate net debt seen rising as companies spend pandemic cash piles,"By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - Global corporates' net debt will increase by as much as $600 billion this year as they start to spend some of the cash piles accumulated during the pandemic, a study by asset manager Janus Henderson said on Wednesday.
Companies borrowed a record $1.3 trillion last year but took a cautious approach towards spending it, which left them sitting on some $5.2 trillion in cash, Janus Henderson said. 
As a result, total debt climbed 10.2% to a record $13.5 trillion for the 2020 financial year, while net debt - calculated as total debt minus cash - rose only marginally to $8.3 trillion.
With economic recovery taking hold, the firm expects a boom in capital expenditure, dividend payments and share buybacks through the second half of this year and beyond.
That anticipated splurge will see global net corporate debt rise by $500-$600 billion by year-end to $8.8-$8.9 trillion, the study predicted. 
However Janus Henderson said the improvement in credit quality with economic recovery and supportive monetary policy, despite the prospect of higher inflation, offered investment opportunities. 
In particular, high yield debt, dubbed junk bonds, have outperformed this year as it is less sensitive to moves in underlying rates. [xnL1N2L60EG] 
""The prospect of higher economic growth and rising inflation...also means improving credit fundamentals – better cash flow, improved leverage ratios,"" fixed income portfolio managers Tom Ross and Seth Meyer said.
""Certainly, debt has risen, but cash has soared, markets are wide open, and free cash flow is accelerating, so companies have a fair wind in their sails."" 

They are betting on the recovery of some of last year's ""fallen angels"" - in other words, companies that lost their investment-grade ratings during the pandemic, particularly food and bevarage companies, such as Kraft, and some auto manfacturers, such as Ford. 
They predicted too that default rates would stay low, possibly below 1% and rise only slightly in 2022, though they highlighted sectors such as airlines and leisure as vulnerable.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday, with financials and other groups closely tied to economic growth leading declines, while the Nasdaq edged higher to another closing record.
The S&P 500 banks index fell 2.5% as U.S. Treasuries rallied, with the 10-year yield hitting its lowest since Feb. 24.Data showed U.S. services industry activity grew at a moderate pace in June, likely restrained by labor and raw material shortages.
The Dow led the day's declines. Financials sank 1.6%, the biggest weight on the S&P 500 followed by energy shares.

Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio, said with Treasury yields down, ""investors may be worried the economy might not be a good as the stock market was showing.""
Also, investors may be taking profits after a strong end of the quarter and string of recent records. ""It was such a good quarter end,"" he said. Now, ""cyclicals are really getting hit.""

This means that if energy prices keep trending higher, these stocks have considerable upside.Energy has been one of the best-performing assets so far this year. YTD, oil is up 51%, while natural gas is up by 36%. Both have reversed all of their losses following steep declines upon the onset of the coronavirus in February and March of 2020 and are now approaching 5-year highs. 
Despite these gains, we are still not seeing a meaningful supply response. CAPEX in the sector has been trending lower since 2015 and completely collapsed during Covid. This past weekend, OPEC couldn’t agree on supply increases. At the same time, demand has been quite strong despite restrictions and reduced economic activity in some parts of the world. Based on the experience of countries that are leading in vaccinations, demand will only increase as case counts drop.
Therefore, it’s likely that oil’s bull market continues, until we start to see a significant supply response. The biggest opportunity may lie in very cheap, small-cap energy stocks such as Vista Oil & Gas (VIST), Vaalco Energy (EGY), and Geopark (GPRK), which could have the most upside if energy prices keep trending higher.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday ended its criminal case accusing four former Wilmington Trust Co executives of hiding troubled loans from regulators after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the company's sale at a fire-sale price.
U.S. Attorney David Weiss in Delaware made the decision after a federal appeals court set aside the May 2018 jury convictions of Wilmington's former President Robert Harra, Chief Financial Officer David Gibson, Controller Kevyn Rakowski and Chief Credit Officer William North.
In a statement, Weiss said the likelihood of obtaining new convictions, together with his office's focus on combating violent crime, opioid overdoses and terrorism ""counsel in favor of declining to retry"" the defendants.
Prosecutors charged the defendants with underreporting ""past due"" commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission to make Wilmington's finances look better and help raise $273.9 million in a stock offering.
But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia unanimously concluded on Jan. 12 that the reporting rules were ambiguous and had more than one reasonable interpretation.
The court acquitted the defendants of making false statements and certifications, while saying they could be tried again for conspiracy and securities fraud.
""My client is relieved. 10 years of a living hell,"" Harra's lawyer Michael Kelly of McCarter & English said in an email. ""He can never regain what he lost.""
Gibson's lawyer Kenneth Breen of Paul Hastings said it ""regrettably"" took a decade to exonerate his client. Rakowski's lawyer Henry Klingeman of Klingeman Cerimele said his client ""has always been innocent and now there is no doubt.""
North's lawyer could not immediately be reached.
The du Pont family founded Wilmington in 1903. M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB), of Buffalo, New York, bought Wilmington in 2011 at 46% below its market value, reflecting the loan losses.
Wilmington was indicted in 2016, the first recipient of federal bailout money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be charged. It reached a $60 million settlement in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawsuit filed by Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd against  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) alleging patent infringement is set to begin jury selection on Wednesday.
In February 2020, Huawei sued Verizon in two U.S. District courts in Texas, alleging the company used a dozen Huawei patents without authorization in areas such as computer networking, download security, and video communications, seeking an unspecified amount of compensation and royalty payments.
Verizon last year called the lawsuits ""nothing more than a PR stunt"" and ""a sneak attack on our company and the entire tech ecosystem"" and filed counterclaims against Huawei, claiming the Chinese company violated Verizon patents.
Huawei said in 2020 that it ""is simply asking that Verizon respect Huawei's investment in research and development by either paying for the use of our patents, or refraining from using them."" Huawei declined comment Tuesday.
Huawei has been a flashpoint in the U.S.-China relationship for several years. The United States placed the company on an economic blacklist in 2019 over what it said were national security concerns.

Jury selection is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Huawei's suit filed in the Eastern District of Texas that involves a small number of patents related to optical transport networks, while the other Texas lawsuit, related to wireless patents, is set for trial in October. The jury selection could be delayed by a day or two depending on the status of an unrelated case.
In June 2019, Reuters reported that Huawei told Verizon it should pay licensing fees for use of more than 230 Huawei patents and was seeking more than $1 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks mostly fell Tuesday along with bond yields and crude prices, as China's latest tech crackdown and expectations of a hawkish Fed report on Wednesday waved red flags at investors. The dollar edged higher.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index withstood the stocks downdraft. After falling nearly 1% by mid-day, it rallied to close up 24.32 points, or 0.17 percent, at 14,663.64.
Earlier, Chinese regulators cracked down on U.S.-listed ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc, sending its shares down more than 20%. Other U.S.-listed Chinese e-commerce firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, fell 3.5% to 4.6%. 
Broader stock gauges eased ahead of Wednesday's release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Most investors expect the FOMC to confirm a hawkish tilt, meaning a slow tightening of monetary policy.
But a benign readout could trigger a ""risk-gone rally"" on the view that lax Fed policy will continue, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA. 
Despite the U.S. economic recovery, many millions remain jobless due to the pandemic, so the United States still has room before the economy really revs up, he added.
The broad S&P 500 lost 8.8 points, or 0.20 percent, to 4,343.54 and the widely watched Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 208.98 points, or 0.6 percent, to 34,577.37.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.324 point or 0.35 percent, to 92.536. The yen was up 0.01 percent, at $110.6100. 
U.S. bond yields fell after data suggested the U.S. economy might not be as hot as some fear. A gauge of the large U.S. services sector showed moderate growth in June, down from a record pace in May.
The data buttressed Friday's U.S. employment report, which many saw as showing an improving labor market, but not at a fast enough pace to signal an economy prone to overheating.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes was down 6.5 basis points to 1.367%.
A month ago, such yields were widely expected to rise in the second half, possibly reaching 2% by year-end. Now, an equally widely held view is that yields may have peaked for the year.
""That is a major reversal for many people,"" Moya said.

The government will hold a new round of bids and allow multiple companies to compete, including rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In November 2019, Microsoft beat favorite Amazon for the contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, which is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon's information technology systems.
Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:
JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.
AUG. 6, 2018:  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) filed a protest with the Defense Department over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more.
OCT. 8, 2018: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said it was no longer vying for the contract, in part because the company's new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.
NOV. 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency ""reasonably"" determined that the single-award approach was in the government's best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.
APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon and Microsoft were selected to continue competing for the contract.
JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with the $10 billion cloud contract.
AUG. 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon's bid following complaints from other technology companies.
OCT. 25, 2019: The Defense Department said that Microsoft won the contract.
NOV. 14, 2019: Amazon said it is contesting the Pentagon's award to Microsoft, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.
NOV. 15, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper rejected any suggestion of bias in the Pentagon's decision after Amazon announced plans to challenge it.
DEC. 9, 2019: Amazon accused U.S. President Donald Trump of exerting ""improper pressure"" and bias that led the Department of Defense to award a lucrative $10 billion cloud contract to rival Microsoft.
JAN. 22, 2020: Amazon filed a motion in court to pause the Department of Defense and Microsoft from carrying out the deal until a court rules on its protest of the contract award.
FEB. 10, 2020: Amazon sought to depose Trump and Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying ""to screw Amazon"" when the Pentagon awarded a contract for cloud computing to rival Microsoft.
MARCH 7, 2020: A U.S. judge said Amazon is likely to succeed on a key argument of its challenge to the decision to award the cloud deal to Microsoft.
APRIL 15, 2020: The Pentagon's inspector general said it could not determine whether the White House influenced the award of a $10 billion contract to Microsoft over Amazon after several officials said their conversations were privileged ""presidential communications.""
APRIL 17, 2020: A U.S. judge put on hold Amazon's lawsuit.

SEPT. 4, 2020: The Defense Department completed a re-evaluation of its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract proposals and determined that Microsoft bid was the best.
APRIL 28, 2021: A judge refused to dismiss Amazon's claims alleging the Trump administration interfered in the Pentagon's award of its $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract to Microsoft.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 recovered most of its losses Tuesday, as big tech cut losses to ease pressure on the broader market following a slump in economically-sensitive stocks amid fears the reopening-led boost to the economy is running out of steam. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, but had been down nearly 0.9% at the lows of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6%, or 208 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.17%. 
Services activity, accounting for nearly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product, slipped more than expected, stoking fears that the pace of the economic recovery is running out of steam.
The June headline ISM Services PMI slipped to 60.1 from 64.0 the previous month. Economists expected a narrower decline to a reading of 63.5.  
""The reopening of the service sector across the country continues to support strong readings in these diffusion indexes. However, momentum has faded somewhat in the states that reopened the earliest,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
U.S. bond yields fell sharply across the yield curve. The benchmark 10-year yield fell to its lowest level since February and faces a key test ahead that could spell trouble for the sectors of the market that move in tandem with the economy like cyclicals, but may also boost growth sectors like tech.
""If the TNX does in fact continue to press lower toward this 200-day in sessions ahead, then we would fully expect the reflationary themes noted above to continue to underperform on a relative basis (so watch tech / large-caps to continue dominating),"" according to Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), however, sees value in cyclicals and touts further gains, particularly in the major bank stocks.

Energy was the biggest loser on the day, as oil prices went on a wild ride, hitting a multi-year high after OPEC+ failed to reach a consensus on a output deal. Gains were reversed as oil prices turned negative amid concerns infighting poses a risk to the overall production accord.  
Tech, meanwhile, ended the day higher despite initial intraday struggles, with Amazon the standout performer.

But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) are two established companies in the semiconductor industry. AMAT provides the materials and engineering solutions used to produce new chips and advanced displays. It operates through the following segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. QCOM develops and commercializes wireless industry technologies. It is organized into three segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives.
An exponential increase in demand and limited supply are pushing semiconductor prices up. The demand is increasing primarily from the electronics and automotive industries, given the increased focus on these two industries thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and global climate change. These factors, combined with huge government and private investments to increase the supply of semiconductors, should drive the industry’s growth.
Investors’ growing interest in this space is evident in iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 66.4% returns over the past year. And, according to Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2028.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Driver Management, which specializes in pushing small banks to improve their financial returns, has found a new target and is now urging Codorus Valley Bankcorp Inc to consider letting itself be bought, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Driver Management, founded two years ago by former investment banker Abbott Cooper, owns a 6% stake in Codorus, a bank holding company, and is expected to make a regulatory filing disclosing its stake and some of its intentions soon, the sources said.
Codorus, which is headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, is valued at $202 million and specializes in providing banking services through its subsidiary PeoplesBank in south central Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. Its share price has climbed 21% this year and traded at $20.20 on Tuesday. 
The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Driver's new investment comes as analysts are forecasting a pickup in mergers and acquisitions in the still-fragmented small bank sector. Driver has successfully pushed for other banks to be bought over the past two years.
Cooper wants Codorus to immediately hire a financial adviser to review all options including a sale, a source familiar with the fund manager's thinking said.
He has expressed concerns to the bank about long-term underperformance and a lack of scale, and has offered to enter a standstill agreement if the bank seriously considers a sale, the source said.
For Driver, the new investment comes on the heels of a win. Last month  United Bankshares  (NASDAQ:UBSI) said that it would buy Community Bankers (NASDAQ:ESXB) Trust Corporation, which Driver had last year pushed to sell itself. Driver Management has gained roughly 48% since January, a person familiar with its return said.

Investing.com -- The Dow and S&P 500 fell weighed by energy and financials as the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to its lowest level since February. But a rally in tech pushed the Nasdaq to another record close.
Investors appear to be waiting for clues on the direction of the economy and interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which will release the minutes of its last policy meeting on Wednesday.
Stocks have hit successive record highs in recent days, driven by strong economic data. But fears about possible economic effects of a fast-spreading variant of Covid could disrupt the optimism. 
Oil prices were also volatile on Tuesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia failed to find agreement on oil production for August and going forward this year. 
Separately, Didi Global Inc ADR (NYSE:DIDI)shares, which listed in New York just last week, plunged 22% on Tuesday after Chinese regulators ordered local app stores to remove the company's ride-hailing app over the weekend amid a security review. 
There isn’t much in the way of earnings or data this week, which is abbreviated in the U.S. because of the July 4 weekend. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. The Fed minutes
The Fed will on Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT) release the minutes of its last meeting in June. Officials of the central bank had hinted at the possibility of two rate hikes in 2023. A lot of people will be looking to read if the minutes match the hawkish comments made in public by some of the Fed officials since the meeting.
2 The JOLTs job openings
US Bureau of Labor Statistics data for job openings and labor turnover is likely to show 9.388 million vacancies for May, higher than the 9.286 million that opened in April. The data are released at 10:00 AM ET.
3. Oil inventory numbers
American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimates of crude inventories after the closing bell Wednesday. The last report showed a draw of 8.1 million barrels. Commodities investors will be watching the numbers from the industry and the government this week after the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia failed to find agreement on output for August.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Didi Global Inc shares fell as much as 25% in early U.S. trading on Tuesday in the first session since Chinese regulators ordered the company's app to be taken down days after its $4.4 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
The ride-hailing giant's app was ordered to be removed from mobile app stores in China on Sunday by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), in order to investigate its findings that the company had illegally collected users' personal data.
On Monday, the CAC on Monday announced cybersecurity investigations into other China-based companies whose U.S.-listed parents' shares also slid. 
Kanzhun Ltd and Full Truck Alliance were last down 17.4% and 14.3%, respectively. 
Extending its actions beyond the tech sector, Beijing also said it would step up supervision of Chinese companies listed offshore in order to crack down on illegal activity and punish fraudulent securities issuance.
U.S.-listed shares in Chinese hip-hop event promoter Pop Culture Group plunged 32%.
The U.S. market was closed on Monday following the July 4 holiday.
Didi Global shares were last trading at about $12.24 - 25.5% below their debut price of $16.65 on June 30.
Didi said on Monday that the app's ban would hurt its revenue in China, even though it remains available for existing users. It also told Reuters it had no knowledge of the investigation prior to the IPO.
But the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing sources, that the company had been warned by regulators to delay the initial public offering (IPO) and examine its network security.
CONSEQUENCES 
""With some news sources saying that Didi knew months in advance that a crackdown was coming, some people will start to have their doubts on governance of the company as well,"" said Sumeet Singh, Aequitas Research director who publishes on Smartkarma. ""If the crackdown was indeed planned months in advance, that would imply that it's not going away soon."" 
Didi shares were sold at $14 each in the IPO, which was the largest listing of a Chinese company in the United States since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised $25 billion in 2014. The company had been valued at up to $75 billion as of Friday. 
""Some investors may have taken comfort that going ahead with the listing was under the blessing of the authorities, when now we know it clearly wasn't,"" said Dave Wang, portfolio manager at Singapore's Nuvest Capital. Nuvest did not participate in Didi's IPO.
Market watchers said the news could have other ramifications.
Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts, said: ""In light of some of the recent news, investors need to be looking at not just valuations of the company based on global opportunities, but keeping in the back of their mind that policies could go into effect and how will that affect companies here in the (United States)."" 
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, sees possibly broader, diplomatic implications.

""It’s backdoor to getting even with the United States while not necessarily mentioning the United States,"" Cardillo said. ""This crackdown further opens the door to a potential economic conflict.""
""Usually these things simmer down rather quickly, but this announcement could have a lingering negative effect.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 moved off lows Tuesday, as big tech cut losses to ease pressure on the broader market following a slump in economically-sensitive stocks amid fears the reopening-led boost to the economy is nearing a peak. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7%, or 382 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.1%. 
Services activity, accounting for nearly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product, slipped more than expected, stoking fears that the pace of the economic recovery  is running out of steam.
The June headline ISM Services PMI slipped to 60.1 from 64.0 the previous month. Economists expected a narrower decline to a reading of 63.5.  
""The reopening of the service sector across the country continues to support strong readings in these diffusion indexes. However, momentum has faded somewhat in the states that reopened the earliest,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
U.S. bond yields fell sharply across the yield curve. The benchmark 10-year yield fell to its lowest level since February and faces a key test ahead that could spell trouble for the sectors of the market that move in tandem with the economy like cyclicals, but may also boost growth sectors like tech.
""If the TNX does in fact continue to press lower toward this 200-day in sessions ahead, then we would fully expect the reflationary themes noted above to continue to underperform on a relative basis (so watch tech / large-caps to continue dominating),"" according to Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden wants to give U.S. farmers more power in negotiating the sale of livestock to big processors and in deciding who repairs their tractors, the White House said on Tuesday.
The executive order, expected within days, will also address such competitive issues as delayed airline baggage, cellphone company practices and Pentagon contracts, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The order would encourage the Federal Trade Commission to limit the ability of farm equipment manufacturers to prevent tractor owners from using independent repair shops or repairing their own equipment. 
Reuters first reported the action on repairs earlier on Tuesday and the planned executive order last week.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday the effort would help farmers ""fight back against abuses of power by giant agribusiness corporations and give farmers the right to repair their own equipment how they like.""
The FTC wrote a report for Congress in May that discussed ""Right to Repair,"" addressing the limits that manufacturers put on who can repair items ranging from mobile phones to home appliances to cars. Such limits may also raise the price of those repairs.
The source said the scope of any ""Right to Repair"" rules would be set by the FTC.
Biden's order could encourage the FTC to lift further limits consumers face for repairing products they buy.
Some tractor manufacturers like Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, AGCO Corp and CNHI use proprietary repair tools and software to prevent third parties from performing some repairs. Shares of the companies fell on news of Biden's plans, first reported by Reuters on Tuesday.
John Deere said in a statement it ""does not support the right to modify embedded software due to risks associated with the safe operation of the equipment, emissions compliance and engine performance."" 
It added that ""less than 2 percent of all repairs require a software update, so the majority of repairs farmers need to make, can be made easily.""
The FTC did not immediately comment.
The source said Biden and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ""believe farmers should have the right to repair their own equipment how they like.""
Separately, Biden plans to direct the USDA to write rules to boost competition in agricultural industries, including one under the Packers and Stockyards Act making it easier for farmers to bring claims, the White House said. There will also be anti-retaliation protections for farmers who raise concerns about bad practices.
Biden will also direct USDA to issue new rules defining when meat can bear ""Product of USA"" labels, Psaki said.
Under current labeling rules, meat can be labeled ""Product of USA"" if it is processed in the United States, even if the livestock is raised overseas and then processed into cuts of meat at a U.S. facility. 

Meatpacking has come under increased scrutiny after slaughterhouses closed temporarily during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, boosting prices for meat sold by processors like JBS USA and  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) while lowering prices for farmers' livestock.
USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has said he wants to make agricultural markets more fair and resilient after the pandemic highlighted how concentration in the sector can hurt farmers. Four companies slaughter about 85% of U.S. grain-fattened cattle that are made into steaks, beef roasts and other cuts of meat for consumers The USDA said in June it would start working on three rules to strengthen enforcement of the Packers & Stockyards Act, passed 100 years ago to protect farmers and ranchers from unfair trade practices.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen is to sell a stake in its electric vehicle charging unit Electrify America, two people familiar with the matter said, as the carmaker looks for outside funds to build infrastructure for battery-powered cars.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is working with Citi to look for a co-investor that is prepared to inject roughly $1 billion into the division, the people said, adding that the company is expected shortly to reach out to infrastructure groups and other potential investors.
Volkswagen, Electrify America and Citi declined to comment.
Set up in the aftermath of Volkswagen's emissions cheating scandal that broke in the United States, Electrify America plans to spend $2 billion in the 2017-2026 period to expand charging stations for electric vehicles (EV).
The unit, whose main rivals include ChargePoint and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Supercharger, has 635 charging stations with around 2,850 fast-loading spots up and running, according to its website.
This includes ultra-fast high-speed of up to 350 kilowatt charging stations enabling owners to load their cars in under 20 minutes.
The company expects to install or have under development about 800 charging stations with about 3,500 fast chargers by December 2021, expanding to 45 states, including two cross-country routes. It also operates solar-powered charging stations.
At Volkswagen's Power Day in March, Electrify America Chief Executive Giovanni Palazzo, who joined Volkswagen from Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) a decade ago, said that the group was planning to expand further.
Volkswagen, which will present its new strategy on July 13, is currently trying to consolidate its various charging efforts under the Charging & Energy business area led by Elke Temme, a long-time executive at Germany's top utility RWE.

Charging infrastructure has attracted several sectors, including utilities, carmakers and big oil firms, all hoping to cash in on a rising demand for electricity in the wake of a global EV rollout.
Sources told Reuters last week that  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Shell (LON:RDSa) were both interested in becoming co-owners in Ionity, the European EV charging joint venture owned by BMW Hyundai, Ford, Daimler and VW.

LONDON (Reuters) - British clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) is emerging from the COVID-19 crisis as a very different business that will surprise people with its financial performance, Chairman Archie Norman said on Tuesday.
Norman and Chief Executive Steve Rowe believe the pandemic has masked progress the 137-year-old group has made in its latest attempt at a turnaround after decades of failures.
They have focused on transforming the culture in M&S, improving the quality and value of its clothing and food products, while reshaping its store estate and investing in technology and e-commerce, including a venture with online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO).
""We sort of feel we're emerging from the pandemic and lockdown, like emerging from a chrysalis, a new and reshaped business,"" Norman told shareholders attending M&S's annual general meeting, held virtually for a second successive year.
""We think we're going to surprise a few people, not just hopefully with our financial performance but also with the things we do to demonstrate that M&S has really changed,"" he said.
Norman, chairman since 2017, said the management had moved on from fixing the basics in the business.
""We're now into a new phase and we'd like to think that new phase is about growth,"" he said, adding this meant expanding sales and market share.
""We're here to create a growing business, absolutely not in the business of managing decline, we're investing for the future,"" he said, adding the retailer was ""very confident"" about the year ahead.
In May, M&S reported an 88% slump in 2020-21 profit but forecast a rebound in 2021-22.

Shares in M&S closed down 2% at 154.4 pence, paring 2021 gains to 13% and valuing the business at 3 billion pounds ($4.1 billion).

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Weibo chairman, state firm plan to take China's Twitter private - sources","By Julie Zhu and Pei Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Nasdaq-listed Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp's chairman and a Chinese state investor plan to take China's answer to Twitter private, sources told Reuters, sending its shares as much as 50% higher on Tuesday.
A deal could value Weibo at more than $20 billion, facilitate shareholder  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s exit and see Weibo eventually relist in China to capitalise on higher valuations, the sources said.
Chairman Charles Chao's holding company New Wave, Weibo's top stakeholder, is teaming up with a Shanghai-based state company to form a consortium for the deal, three sources said, without disclosing the state firm's identity.
The consortium is looking to offer about $90-$100 per share to take Weibo private, two of the sources said, representing a premium of 80%-100% to the stock's $50 average price over the past month.
The group aims to finalise the deal this year, they said. 
Weibo said in a statement that Chao and a state investor being in talks to take the company private was untrue. It cited Chao as saying he had had no discussion with anyone regarding delisting the company.
Weibo and Alibaba did not respond to Reuters requests for further comments. Chao did not respond to request for comment via Weibo parent company Sina (NASDAQ:SINA).
Shares in Weibo, which operates a platform similar to Twitter, surged more than 50% in premarket trading after the Reuters report. Those gains have shrunk to just over 6% after the opening bell.
BEIJING DRIVE
Three separate sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the plans stem from Beijing's drive to have Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and affiliate Ant divest their media holdings to rein in their sway over Chinese public opinion.
All the sources declined to be named due to confidentiality constraints.
Reuters reported in February that Weibo had hired banks to work on a Hong Kong secondary listing in the final half of 2021. Sources said this is no longer the plan.
Alibaba held 30% of Weibo as of February, the latter's annual report showed, which was worth $3.7 billion as of Friday's close.
REGULATORY CRACKDOWN 
Beijing has looked to rein in Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba business empire by unleashing a series of investigations and new regulations since last year.
The crackdown followed Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year and has swept across China's money-spinning internet sector in recent months.
E-commerce giant Alibaba has invested in nearly 30 media and entertainment firms including Hong Kong's flagship English-language newspaper South China Morning Post, Refinitiv data shows.
Chao's mooted deal would likely see it exit Weibo, two of the sources said. 
The plan also reflects China's efforts to tighten control over private media and internet businesses, sources added.
U.S.-listed Chinese firms also face heightened scrutiny and potentially stricter audit requirements from U.S. regulators, amid political tensions between Beijing and Washington.
A number of Chinese companies have already opted out of U.S. stock exchanges, by going private or returning to equity markets closer to home via second listings.
There were 16 announced delistings of U.S.-listed Chinese companies worth $19 billion last year, Dealogic data showed, compared to just five such deals worth $8 billion in 2019. 
China's cabinet said on Tuesday that it would step up supervision of firms listed offshore citing the need to improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security.
FIERCE COMPETITION
Weibo has grown at a fast clip since its launch in 2009 in a market where Twitter is blocked by the government. More than 500 million Chinese use Weibo to opine on everything from Korean soap operas to China's latest political intrigue.
Alibaba acquired an 18% stake in Weibo in 2013 via a $586 million investment as its first big move into selling advertisement on China's social networks. It has since raised its stake. 
Weibo, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2014, makes most of its revenue from online advertising. 
That has worried investors as the growth rate of Chinese online advertising slows and Weibo has also lost ground amid competition with other tech giants such as ByteDance and Tencent. 

The Beijing-based company advertising and marketing revenue fell 3% last year to $1.5 billion. 
Its shares were up 33% this year, after a fall of 12% in 2020.

Wall Street analysts expect the prices of the shares of Uber (UBER), Micron (MU), and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) to surge more than 35% in the coming months. So, let’s discuss.Tech stocks have been regaining momentum over the past couple of months following an extended sell-off earlier this year. Amid the rapid adoption of hybrid working structures and emergence of 5G, most companies are developing next-generation products with better storage space and high efficiency to improve customer satisfaction and gain market reach, thereby restoring investor optimism in the tech space. 
This is evidenced by the iShares U.S. Technology ETF’s (IYW) 9% returns over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.2% gains. Also, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 12.5% year-to-date to hit its 14,649.11 all-time high in the last trading session.
Given investors’ bullish outlook for the tech industry amid rapid digitization in almost every sector, Wall Street analysts expect popular tech stocks Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and Pure Storage, Inc. (PSTG) to gain more than 35% in the near-term.

However, the challenges related to higher installation and scalability costs of the emerging ocean energy systems market make OPTT’s growth prospects gloomy. So, given that the company’s financials look bleak, the question is, will the stock be able to recover, or will it decline soon? Read ahead to learn more.Wave-energy-based renewable company Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. (OPTT) offers proprietary systems, such as its PB3 PowerBuoy system, that generate power by harnessing the energy of ocean waves, in the United States and internationally. OPTT’s stock has gained 322.3% over the past year on growing investor optimism about the clean energy sector’s prospects.
Closing yesterday’s trading session at $2.96, OPTT’s stock is trading 33.8% below its $7.30 all-time high, which it hit on January 25. While the stock has gained 23.9% over the past month, it has lost 4.5% over the past three months.
Pandemic-induced delays in OPTT’s revenue-generating projects negatively impacted the company’s top line in its last reported quarter. Its revenue has shrunk, and its profit margin remained negative. Although the clean energy hype has been driving its shares up over the past year, OPTT’s current valuation is not justified, given the high losses and expenses incurred by the company. So, we think the stock could suffer a pullback in the near term.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has snapped up a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker to take on a senior role within its global industrials group as the scandal-hit Swiss lender seeks to revamp its investment banking team after a series of recent departures.
Kyle Berry is set to join Credit Suisse as a managing director in the global industrial group on July 19 and will focus on business services across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by a spokesperson for the bank.
The appointment comes amid efforts by Switzerland's second-largest bank to retain staff after the Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management scandals hammered its share price and set off a wave of departures. 
The talent outflow was particularly felt in the United States where Credit Suisse lost at least 15 bankers including Stephanie Ruiz, a managing director within the global industrials investment banking arm who moved to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in June.
An 11-year veteran of Morgan Stanley, Berry has held posts in both Britain and South Africa where he started his career in 2006 as part of Nedbank's corporate finance and equity derivative team in Johannesburg.
Most recently he represented a wide range of business services clients including Swedish alarm company Verisure, British catering firm  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) and U.S. private security firm Allied Universal.
He will be based in London where he will report to Gregory Dalle and Pierre Lescastereyres, the bank's co-heads of the industrials and energy franchise for EMEA.

The memo said Credit Suisse wanted to build on ""the positive momentum of 2020"" when a series of high-profile industry deals were agreed including the 3.8 billion-pound ($5.26 billion) takeover of security firm  G4S  (CSE:G4S) by Allied Universal and the purchase of Synlab's analytics and services unit by Swiss inspections group SGS.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.5% during Tuesday’s trading after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it was time to start buying the shares of the iPhone maker.
The Wall Street giant raised its target for the stock to $170, an upside of almost 20% from the stock’s current level.
Analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained his overweight rating on the stock while raising the target from $165.
According to Chatterjee, the stock has underperformed the broader market by a significant magnitude in the first half of 2021 despite a fairly resilient volume outlook for the iPhone 12 series.
“The upside pressure on volumes for the iPhone 12 series, historical outperformance in the July-September time period heading into launch event, and further catalysts in relation to outperformance for iPhone 13 volumes relative to lowered investor expectations implies a very attractive set up for the shares in the second half of the year,” Chatterjee wrote in his note.
The analyst believes Apple will outperform the broader market ""materially"" in the second half and says it is time to start buying the stock again.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 11:08AM ET</span>",Explainer: EU throws weight behind new standard for green bonds,"By Simon Jessop
(Reuters) - The European Commission on Tuesday announced a plan to introduce a European Green Bond Standard to strengthen oversight of the burgeoning sector and funnel money to projects and programmes that help it meet its climate goals.
Green bonds typically raise money for environmentally friendly projects such as solar or wind power, low-carbon transportation infrastructure or resource-efficient housing. Governments are also keen to raise green sovereign debt.
Total issuance, globally, recently passed $1 trillion for the first time and demand is set to grow strongly in the coming years. 
Below are some of the main features of the new standard.
WHAT IS THE COMMISSION PROPOSING?
The new standard (EGBS) aims to help companies raise money for projects and governments for programmes which are in line with the bloc's climate goals. The standard will use the definition of green economic activities as laid out in the European Union's taxonomy, or classification, of climate friendly assets, and aims to be the 'gold standard' framework for issuance globally, with tougher regulatory oversight than for existing, market-driven frameworks.
WHY IS IT COMING NOW?
Green bond issuance has surged five-fold in the bloc over the last five years, accounting for more than half of global issuance in 2020, with 49% denominated in euros. Despite this, green bonds only make up 2.6% of EU bond issuance and policymakers are keen to see this jump considerably as they look to achieve the EU's climate goal of being net zero emissions by 2050. The Commission also believes that doing so will help reinforce the role of the euro in international markets and bolster its Capital Markets Union aims.
WHO CAN USE IT?
The standard is voluntary and will be open to companies and governments both inside and outside of the bloc, and will cover all types of bonds including covered bonds, asset-backed securities and project bonds.
WHAT ARE ITS MAIN FEATURES? 
As well as being voluntary and open to all, the EGBS will require issuers to allocate 100% of the proceeds to taxonomy-aligned activities by the time the bond matures, with duration of up to 10 years. The bonds will also be subject to external review, with reviewers overseen by the bloc's markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority.

WHY DOES THE MARKET NEED A NEW FRAMEWORK?
The Commission believes that the market suffers from a lack of clear definitions about what constitutes a green project, raising uncertainty and costs for issuers and investors.

The country's grocery sector faces a new threat from companies like Weezy, Getir, Dija, and Gorillas who offer an ultra-fast service, supplying groceries via apps in as little as 15 minutes.
But British online grocer and technology group Ocado said the new entrants posed much more of a danger to neighbourhood corner shops than online supermarket sales, such as Ocado's online-only grocery joint venture with Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY).
Traditional online grocery shopping, where people book delivery slots days in advance would continue to underpin the market.
""The channel shift is going to move to the big warehouses because they are the format that offers customers the lowest price and the largest range, and the freshest food, and customers have always migrated to those factors,"" Steiner told reporters on Tuesday.
Speaking after Ocado reported a 20% rise in first-half retail revenue, he said there was a market for immediate grocery delivery, but that market is small, and the market for deliveries within 15 minutes even smaller. 
Ocado is rolling out its Ocado Zoom service which offers deliveries within an hour, while Sainsbury's ""Chop Chop"" service guarantees the delivery of up to 20 items in 60 minutes.
Other supermarkets, including market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Asda, are also trialing rapid delivery options.
Morrisons, Aldi and Waitrose also use app Deliveroo as a platform for quick delivery.
Currently online shops account for about 14% of Britain's overall grocery market. Steiner said short-term needs probably account for 5% of that overall market and he suggested ultra-fast delivery could address 14% of that 5% short-term segment.

The more immediate the delivery, the more expensive the service and the narrower the range of products, he said, adding that people might be willing to spend a bit more on the occasional immediate top-up but that is as far as it will go.
He also noted that the rapid delivery sector would only ever be able to serve densely-populated urban areas.

However, will the stock continue to gain based on increasing demand for its Celebros solution? Let’s find out.Digital engagement company Bridgeline Digital, Inc. (BLIN) is known for its award-winning Bridgeline Unbound experience management platform, which was formerly known as iAPPS. The stock of the Burlington, Mass. company has rallied 246.3% over the past month to close Friday’s trading session at its 52-week high of $8.97. This 56% rally in the last trading session can be attributed primarily to investors’ optimism surrounding the company’s increase in cash balance from its warrants. BLIN announced on July 2 that it had received more than $2.5 million in cash on its exercise of warrants, which brought its cash balance to roughly $6 million.
The company’s acquisition of WooRank and HawkSearch in 2021 also contributed to its growth, with WooRank driving traffic to websites by helping improve search engine optimization, and HawkSearch growing online revenues for ecommerce websites by increasing conversion and optimizing the search experience for visitors. 
However, BLIN incurred losses in its last-reported quarter (ended March 31, 2021). Moreover, it priced a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of $5.1 million, which is expected to lead to share dilution. So, BLIN’s near-term prospects seem uncertain.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>",EU launches green bond framework to help it meet climate goals,"By Simon Jessop
(Reuters) - The European Commission on Tuesday proposed a new European Green Bond Standard to drive money into projects that will help the bloc meet its mid-century climate goal of net zero carbon emissions.
The voluntary framework aims to form a 'gold standard' for companies and governments looking to raise money for environmentally friendly projects and programmes, and forms part of the second iteration of the EU's Sustainable Finance package.
As the global market for green bonds grows strongly - passing $1 trillion in total size - the standard also aims to help stop 'greenwashing', where issuers post lofty environmental claims without justification. EU regulators say the practice needs stricter scrutiny. 
""Our EU Green Bond Standard proposal will set a gold standard in the market, and responds to the needs of investors for a trusted, robust tool when investing sustainably,” said Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner in charge of Financial Services, Financial Stability, and Capital Markets Union.
Green bonds issuance is still tiny at about 2-4% of the global bond market, but is growing fast.
While there will be no obligation on issuers to use the EU's standard, the more rigorous oversight of those which do is likely to lead many companies to adopt it, especially within the region, although issuers from outside the bloc can also use it.
But issuers that do offer a bond under the EU regime can be fined by their national regulator if they don't fully comply with the disclosure rules, an EU official said.
Unlike other standards already used in the market, such as the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles, the EU's standard will be 100% based on the bloc's taxonomy, or list of activities it considers to be green.
This could prove particularly attractive to both companies in the real economy and financial market participants as they look to show how aligned their investments are with the bloc's climate goals.
Issuers must also get an external check that the money raised was spent on the intended projects or programmes, and the verifiers will be overseen by the EU's markets regulator, with national regulators having the ability to fine miscreants.
In line with market practice, before issuing the bond a Green Bond Factsheet must be produced detailing the types of projects to be funded and the plan of the issuer to align with the EU's standard.
Post-issue, the issuer has to report yearly on how they are allocating the proceeds of the bond, until all the money has been spent. At that point, an external reviewer must be brought in to check. Sovereign issuers will use their respective state auditors.

A third report, an Environmental Impact Report, is then required to look at the aggregate environmental impact of the bond over its lifetime.
Eliminating emissions to ""net zero"" means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. When the amount produced by human activity falls to no more than the amount taken away, net zero is reached.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - AngloGold Ashanti's newly-appointed chief executive officer Alberto Calderon told Reuters on Tuesday he will take action to remove a roughly 80% discount in value relative to its gold mining peers and dismissed merger rumours. 
After a nearly 10-month search, the South Africa-headquartered bullion miner said on Tuesday Calderon would take over as CEO from Sept. 1.
Following the news, AngloGold shares rose more than 4%, outpacing its Johannesburg-listed gold mining peers Harmony Gold and Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI), before giving up some gains to be 1.89% higher at 1405 GMT.
Calderon is an industry veteran, who previously headed Melbourne-based explosives maker Orica Ltd and worked as a senior executive at mining giant BHP Group (NYSE:BHP). He also served as CEO of Cerrejón, Colombia's largest mining operation.
In an interview, he said he would seek to resolve the issues that have weighed on AngloGold, including fast-tracking project approvals. 
""It's a combination of factors that I think is affecting the discount to the market, and if we can solve most of them the value creation is enormous,"" Calderon said.
""Our discount to our peers in fair-value is enormous, about 80%.""
With old, deep mines and ore that is difficult to extract, South African gold miners have traded at a discount to their global peers for years.
Although AngloGold has no operations in South Africa, Calderon said there are no immediate plans to move its primary listing from Johannesburg. 
""Clearly at some point the board and myself will need to address this and land on a solution,"" he said.
AngloGold - which has mines in several other African countries as well as Argentina, Australia and Brazil - had previously considered moving its primary listing.
Calderon's appointment takes place a year after former CEO Kelvin Dushnisky resigned, following a two-year stint in charge.
Interim CEO Christine Ramon has been appointed as chief financial officer.
AngloGold's share price was hurt by Dushnisky's resignation, as miners globally battled the impact of the pandemic, although record high bullion prices boosted profits. 
It was among the worst performing shares among gold mining companies globally and has lost almost half its market value in the last year, underperforming mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), which weakened 32% during the same period.
Calderon dismissed rumours of a gold mega-merger. 

""I don't see any other option in the short-run to add better value than through organic and efficient, optimised growth internally,"" he said. ""I think any other thing will just be a distraction.""
Sibanye-Stillwater CEO Neal Froneman floated the idea of a merger with AngloGold and Gold Fields in March, saying consolidation was needed for South Africa's gold miners to compete globally.

Investing.com – Shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) slipped 1.7% after Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform, citing difficulty in quantifying its liabilities owing to the legal challenges it faces.
Analyst John Walsh has a target of $212 for the 3M stock, 7.8% higher than its current level of $196.69.
According to Walsh, 3M’s earnings per share could approach $11 in 2022, but he doesn’t expect to see significant multiple expansion due to the legal challenge occupying the company.
Last month, a federal judge ruled that Kent County, Michigan, residents can proceed with claims that 3M and shoemaker Wolverine World Wide (NYSE:WWW) contaminated their drinking-water wells.
According to a Reuters report, the residents say the companies created a private and public nuisance by knowingly polluting their environment with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a family of chemicals contained in 3M's fabric treatment Scotchguard that Wolverine used at its Rockford, Michigan, tannery.
In another lawsuit that 3M faces, more than 230,000 service members, veterans and others have blamed 3M earplugs for causing hearing loss.

Hydrogen has come into the spotlight in Europe, where EU environment ministers want truck CO2 emissions cut by a third by 2030 from 2019 levels, threatening potential diesel bans and higher taxes but promising up to 75% of lower road tolls for greener vehicles.
Although more expensive than battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, driven by on-board hydrogen, will potentially benefit from Europe's desire to build a world-leading industry around the hydrogen technology.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Vauxhall car factory in northwest England will get a 100-million pound ($140 million) investment to produce electric vans, owner Stellantis said on Tuesday, the second positive announcement for British vehicle output in recent days.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) pledged last week to invest further in the country with plans for a new giant battery plant, as companies electrify their line-ups ahead of looming bans.
The future of Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory had been uncertain since its owner said in 2019 that it wanted to make the new Astra car there, but that would depend on the outcome of Brexit, which was only settled in December 2020.
Stellantis said it had been ""supported by the UK government"", having sought a binding commitment from the authorities to make fresh investment. Some car companies have received around 10% towards their spending. 
""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Trade barrier fears prompted some to halt investment in recent years but a Dec. 24 agreement secured zero-tariff trade for the sector, subject to vehicles containing a minimum level of parts sourced from the region. 
From later in 2022, the site will produce the Vauxhall/Opel Combo-e, Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) e-Partner and Citroen e-Berlingo vans and their passenger car variants, making the location Stellantis' first site dedicated to battery electric vehicles for the brands.
Cells will be imported from its affiliate ACC in continental Europe or other suppliers although the company said it did not rule out UK production if it later needed additional capacity. 
Van demand has risen more quickly than for cars this year in Britain following store closures and an increase in online shopping.
Vauxhall, which trades as Opel in continental Europe, already produces vans at its southern English Luton factory where it made just over 62,000 vehicles last year. 

In May, Stellantis said the site would gain a third shift to meet demand for the Vivaro, Citroen Jumpy/Dispatch and Peugeot Expert. 
More spending could come as it intends ""to consult on further investment into the Ellesmere Port site with the creation of a new UK parts distribution centre"".

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets reopened after the long weekend in mixed fashion, with the S&P 500 reversing rapidly after opening at a new record high, while the American Depositary Receipts of Chinese companies suffered as Beijing flagged tighter controls on companies listing abroad.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 138 points, or 0.4%, at 34,648 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rising 0.6% to a new record high,
However, there were some sharp falls registered by Chinese ADRs, with ride-hailing giant Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) falling 23% in response to Chinese regulators banning it from local app stores over data retention concerns. The same pressures hit online recruitment stock Kanzhun (NASDAQ:BZ), which fell 8.4%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs also fell 5.3% and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs fell 4.1%. Only Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) ADRs resisted the trend, spiking after a Reuters report that its chairman was drawing up plans to take it public. The stock pared gains after the company denied the report, but the stock was still up 12%.
On Tuesday, China's State Council had issued a broad but vaguely-worded warning that it will intensify supervision of companies listing overseas, especially with regard to their data policies. That followed a Wall Street Journal report asserting that the Chinese Administration for Cyberspace had ""suggested"" to Didi to postpone its IPO last week, but that the company had plowed on regardless. The stock's decline on Tuesday wiped some $18 billion off the company's value and left it trading below its IPO price for the first time.
The Chinese moves are the latest in a growing estrangement between the U.S. and Chinese financial markets, against the background of a geopolitical rivalry that hasn't lessened since the departure of ex-President Donald Trump.
The market was also spooked by a reversal in Crude Oil prices, on the dawning realization that any spike caused by the failure of last week's OPEC meeting could easily be followed either by a breakdown of output discipline by the world's biggest exporters, or by further rises in inflation that could prompt global central banks to withdraw monetary stimulus. U.S. crude futures fell 0.4% to trade again below $$75 a barrel. 
Another factor weighing on sentiment was the sign that the bounce in U.S. economic activity may be flattening out, after a series of short-term economic data that have benefited from extremely weak year-earlier comparables. The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing PMI fell to 60.4 from 66.2 the previous month. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock fell 1.3% and 5.0% respectively, after an Israeli study suggested that their Covid-19 vaccine was markedly less effective against the delta variant of the disease currently sweeping much of the world. 
Among the gainers were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, both of which profited from investors seeing their regulatory risk in a more charitable light, while AMC Entertainment  (NYSE:AMC) stock also bucked the trend, rising 2.0% after the cinema operator scrapped a contentious plan to raise capital with a new share issue."

Investing.com – AMC (NYSE:AMC) rose 1.7% Tuesday after dropping plans to seek shareholder approval to issue 25 million more shares.
In a filing Tuesday, AMC said the proposal to increase its outstanding shares to about 549 million would no longer be up for a vote at its July 29 annual meeting.
“It’s no secret I think shareholders should authorize 25 million more AMC shares,” AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said in a tweet Tuesday. “But what YOU think is important to us. Many yes, many no. AMC does not want to proceed with such a split.”


The theater chain proposed the share increase in a separate filing June 3, seeking to capitalize on the Reddit-driven rally that had boosted the so-called meme stock by 2,300% this year to that point. The stock was up more than 2,350% for 2021 through July 2, according to Bloomberg.
In less than a 30-day period leading up to June's first week, AMC raised $1.24 billion combined through three share sales.
Not only that, according to Aron, there will be no more share sale in 2021.
“Of course, voting on the other 4 issues requiring approval at the July 29 annual AMC shareholder meeting will continue on schedule. But proposal 1 is hereby officially tabled. There will be no voting before 2022 on more shares,” Aron said in a second tweet.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>",WeWork rival IWG grows to meet COVID-driven shift from big offices,"By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Britain's IWG has added more than 100 shared-office spaces to its global network this year, three times as many as in the first half of 2020, as it anticipates a lasting shift from working in large offices.
The company has struggled with plummeting occupancy levels in office buildings and last month said this year's earnings would be well below 2020 levels. 
But the company, known for its Regus and Spaces workspaces that compete with WeWork, is banking on a long-term shift to smaller, more local workplaces.
It said it signed 20 new franchise partners in the first half of 2021 that will add more than 110 shared-office locations to its network, compared with 30 last year.
The deals are in countries including India, Malaysia and the United States, with many workspaces being planned in small towns.
""Companies are indicating that hybrid work is here for the long term. This demand has been driven by a desire from employees to live and work locally,"" IWG said in a statement. 
The ramp-up includes four new centres to the North Indian town of Zirakpur, and three new flexible workspaces in the coastal city of Melaka in Malaysia, as employees explore the mix of working at home or nearby and commuting.
The expansion comes at no cost to IWG, whose franchise partners will invest in the centres.
The pandemic-led shift in working habits saw IWG sign its biggest-ever deal earlier this year, providing Japanese telecoms group NTT's 300,000 staff global access to its offices.
The number of publicly listed UK-based companies considering hybrid workspaces - a combination of work from home, the traditional office or company-designated shared office spaces - has tripled this year, IWG said, citing internal research.

Last month, demand in the United Kingdom for hybrid spaces was up 15% compared to pre-pandemic, while the United States saw a 43% surge, IWG said in an email.

1497,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>","China to Tighten Rules on Data, Overseas Listings After Didi","(Bloomberg) -- China issued a sweeping warning to its biggest companies, vowing to tighten oversight of data security and overseas listings just days after Didi Global Inc (NYSE:DIDI)’s contentious decision to go public in the U.S.
While the statement from China’s State Council on Tuesday was thin on details, it suggests Beijing is preparing to intensify a crackdown on its corporate sector that has spanned everything from property debt and fintech to antitrust issues and now cybersecurity.
Rules for overseas listings will be revised, the State Council said in a statement Tuesday, while publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. China also said it will step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets.
The move comes after the cyberspace regulator announced a probe into Didi, which controls almost the entire ride-hailing market in China, and pulled the company’s app from stores. The strong response from Beijing, which came just days after the $4.4 billion IPO, prompted Didi’s shares to plunge as much as 30% in pre-market U.S. trading on Tuesday. The latest statement marks an escalation in President Xi Jinping’s campaign to bring the nation’s technology firms -- and their reams of valuable data -- under control.
“It is a big step from China, but on the other hand it is part of series of events that started over a year ago,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Hellerup, Denmark. “ The uncertainty is still over to what degree all of this regulation will impact longer term profitability.”
U.S. exchanges remain a popular choice for Chinese entrepreneurs, especially in the tech industry, despite efforts by Beijing to encourage companies to list back home, including Hong Kong. Chinese firms raised $7.9 billion in the U.S. last month through first-time share sales, the most since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s IPO in September 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
But U.S. exchanges are becoming increasingly hostile to Chinese companies, which may face delisting if they refuse to hand over financial information to American regulators. An effort by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to gain access to audits of overseas companies, which began under former President Donald Trump, is continuing under the Biden administration. Some Chinese firms have said China’s national security laws prohibit them from turning over audit papers to U.S. regulators.
The move could prompt Chinese technology firms traded in the U.S. to reconsider their listings. Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp. chairman Charles Chao and a state investor are in talks to take Weibo private, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The structure of the deal would allow major shareholder Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to exit its stake, according to the report. “The speculation is not true,” a representative for Weibo told Bloomberg News, declining to elaborate.
Beijing may also be seeking to close loopholes that allow Chinese firms to list overseas without approval if they are incorporated offshore. Many technology firms including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)are registered in places such as the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.
Beijing has grown increasingly concerned over the amount of data that Didi and other technology firms hold. Didi for instance has vast amounts of sensitive information from half a billion annual active users, mostly in China. Over the past year, Xi’s government has sought to gain control of such data, both to protect users from abuse and find a way to use it to spur broad-based economic growth rather than enrich a cohort of billionaires that could potentially challenge the Communist Party’s authority.
China’s campaign to impose tougher controls on the nation’s tech firms was forcefully demonstrated late last year when they pulled Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Investing.com – Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) ADRs gave up almost two-third of the gains they had notched during Tuesday’s premarket trading but remained up 11% from Friday's close, after the company denied a news report that there are plans to take it private.
Earlier in the session, it had been up approximately 40%.
The initial move was triggered by a Reuters report that said its Chairman Charles Chao and a state investor are in talks to take the Chinese company private in a deal giving the Twitter-like firm a valuation of at least $20 billion.
Chao, whose holding company New Wave is the largest shareholder of Weibo, is teaming up with a Shanghai-based state firm to form a consortium for the deal, a Reuters report said.
According to the report, the consortium is intending to offer current shareholders about $90-$100 per share, a premium of 80%-100% to the share's $50 average price over the past month.
The share closed at $54.31 on Friday. U.S. markets were shut Monday on account of Independence Day.
The deal would have provided an exit to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), another large shareholder in the company.
New Wave held a 45% stake in Weibo as of February valued at $5.6 billion as of Friday's close, followed by Alibaba with 30%, according to the company's 2020 annual report.
The development comes amid a crackdown by Chinese authorities on the large tech companies in that country over sharing of user data. With many of them listed in the U.S., there are concerns in the communist country over the large cache of consumer data these companies may have to disclose under the U.S. laws from time to time. "
1500,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 08:42AM ET</span>","With European recovery in sight, property investors bank on the office","By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - After more than a year of home working, property investors are betting that demand for office space in Europe will rise as COVID-19 vaccinations are rolled out and people return to work.
Global office real estate leasing volumes dropped 31% in the first quarter compared with a year ago, according to real estate broker JLL, although Europe proved more resilient than the United States.
""The perception that the office is over is complete nonsense,"" said Keith Breslauer, managing partner of European property investor Patron Capital.
""None of the smart money believes it.""
Breslauer worked on three new office development opportunities in British regional cities on one day last month. ""We weren't alone,"" he said.
The long-term impact of the pandemic on working patterns remains unclear. 
Banking firm HSBC plans to nearly halve its global real estate, while consultancy Deloitte has told its UK staff they can work wherever they want. U.S. banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have ordered employees back to the office. 
""Some will expand and some will contract, some won't change at all,"" said James Corl, head of the private real estate group at U.S. investment manager Cohen & Steers (NYSE:CNS).
""The wake of economic downturns always provides the best investing opportunities."" 
Corl said a rise in hybrid working -- from the office a few days a week and the rest at home -- is being counterbalanced by the need for more office space per person in an age of social distancing. 
A supply shortage that pre-dates the pandemic is also supporting prices even though companies may need 20-30% less space, investors said.
Simon Martindale, fund director at Mayfair Capital, said the real estate manager was arranging a large regional office letting in Britain for a ""big corporate"" seeking extra space. 
The pandemic has hurt large firms in Europe less than initially expected -- helped by strong government support -- and most have continued to pay rent, analysts and brokers say.
U.S. centres such as San Francisco and New York have not been so resilient -- possibly because venture capital and private equity tenants are less able than multinationals to take on new leases, said Matthew McAuley, director, global research at JLL. 
Investment transactions dropped sharply due to the pandemic, brokers say. But where deals have taken place, prices for offices in Europe's central business districts have risen 13% in 2021 from 2020, according to Real Capital Analytics, while comparable U.S. transaction prices have fallen.
U.S. property investors are increasingly interested in Europe, industry sources say.
""A number of overseas investors (are) willing to visit London and quarantine in order to inspect and bid on buildings,"" real estate broker Savills said recently.
New York-listed Kennedy Wilson last week bought an office block close to London's U.S. embassy for $252 million -- above a roughly $222 million reported price for an aborted sale of the building in 2019.
LOCATION, LOCATION
For Britain, the ""double storm cloud"" of Brexit and COVID-19 is clearing, said Ronald Dickerman, president of property investor Madison: ""We are very, very bullish on the UK recovery and London."" 
Madison, an investor in Capital & Counties, owner of London's Covent Garden shopping district, last month bought a minority stake in the 37-storey Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Tower in the City financial district.
RE Capital plans to spend up to 150 million pounds ($208 million) on central London offices this year. It bought a building in Westminster, close to Britain's parliament, last year. 
""When you look at deliverable supply in the next few years, it is very constrained,"" said Simon Banks, RE Capital's head of UK real estate, adding ""location is ever more important"". 
Employees may prefer to be near mainline rail stations as they remain cautious about buses or the metro, for example. 
David Greenbaum, CFO of central European property firm CPI, said the pandemic had not changed its approach to the office, which makes up more than 50% of its portfolio.
Staff who were enthusiastic about working from home last spring are now missing out on training and collaboration opportunities, and the desire for home-working was likely to wane, he said. ""The pendulum always swings.""
Vacancy rates remain very low in cities like Berlin, he added, underpinning the market.
Rents rose by around 2% in the first quarter for prime Berlin offices compared with a year ago and by more than 5% in Paris, while London's West End was stable, according to CBRE. In New York's mid-town, with more unoccupied space, rents fell by more than 5%.
WAREHOUSE WOES
Investor interest in offices is increasing as logistics -- warehouses -- starts to look expensive.
""Yields in logistics have dropped 300 basis points in five years, from 7-9% to 4-6%. It's very hard to make money in this space,"" said Patron Capital's Breslauer. 
Logistics firms are struggling with the costs of last-mile delivery, encouraging trends such as pick-up points in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fresh stores and fast delivery grocery services with smaller city-based distribution centres, sources said. 
Those changes, and a return to normal shopping, could put a lid on the sector.
""There's so much money chasing one asset class,"" said Zachary Gauge, European real estate analyst at UBS. 

""I find logistics a bit concerning.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Ocado (LON:OCDO) said demand for its grocery business and technology remained strong after it announced a 20% rise in first-half retail revenue on Tuesday and a new contract in Spain.
The online grocer said the pandemic had resulted in a permanent shift to web-based shopping, helping drive demand for groceries it sells with partner Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and for its technology which helps retailers expand online.
Its retail revenue for the 26 weeks to May 30, a period when Britain was mostly lockdown, rose 20% to 1.2 billion pounds ($1.66 billion). 
As COVID-19 restrictions in the UK have eased, Ocado said that it was continuing to add new customers and while basket sizes had shrunk a little since restaurants had reopened, they were still larger than before the pandemic. 
""We are confident Ocado Retail will continue to grow market share as we help them to roll out even more capacity,"" CEO Tim Steiner told reporters. 
TECHNOLOGY CONTRACT
Ocado also announced its first new technology contract since the pandemic began as it signed up Auchan Retail to help expand the online business of its Alcampo supermarket chain in Spain. 
Steiner said the deal ""may open up other opportunities"" with Auchan, a global grocery retailer. 
The company also kept its full-year outlook and said it was comfortable with the consensus for group core earnings (EBITDA). 
Ocado shares were up 2.8% to 2,041 pence at 0832 GMT. 
""We see a new contract and encouraging newsflow around retail performance as encouraging,"" said Numis analysts in a note. 
Ocado already has contracts for its robotic warehouse technology with supermarket groups including Kroger (NYSE:KR) in the United States, Casino in France and Aeon in Japan.

Ocado shares are down 11% this year versus Britain's bluechip index which is up 11%. That weakness follows a surge in the stock in the early stages of the pandemic last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's future as a hub for fintech in the wake of Brexit faces a crucial test this week with the London Stock Exchange listing of cross-border payments firm Wise.
A flourishing fintech sector is seen as a way for the British capital to maintain its position as a leading global financial center in the aftermath of Brexit and the government has been pushing for rules to encourage public listings. 
Now Wise, which began life as Transferwise, is due to complete a rare direct listing on Wednesday at a valuation of 5-6 billion pounds ($6.9-$8.3 billion), sources told Reuters. 
Its flotation is set to crown a record breaking year for London listings and could pave the way for several other fast-growing British firms in the financial technology sphere, a dozen investors, entrepreneurs and experts told Reuters.
""Whether other companies choose to follow in Wise's footsteps and decide to list will depend on its success when it hits the market,"" Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS, said, adding that an ""old guard"" of fintechs are reaching maturity and looking for the best way to cash out.
Others coming up through the ranks are firms such as London-based Revolut and payments firm Checkout.com, which have been raising hundreds of millions of dollars from private investors at increasingly heady valuations.
A spokeswoman declined to comment on the listing of Wise, whose growth has tracked the expansion of British fintech, which has been supported by both regulators and governments. 
Co-founded by Estonian friends Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus, Wise quickly becoming one of Europe's most prominent fintech companies. It has been profitable since 2017 and now serves 10 million customers worldwide.
Fintech companies in London raised $4.5 billion from investors in 2020, compared with $185 million when Wise first launched in 2011, Dealroom data provided by the City of London's promotional agency London & Partners shows.

""We have seen a host of fintech and financial services companies emerge in the UK since 2015 when they (Wise) first became popular, and I think the Wise listing will give it even more momentum,"" Howard Womersley Smith, a fintech and data lawyer at Reed Smith, said of the sector. 
""It shows the way for fintech entrepreneurs,"" he added.
HURDLES 
Investors and entrepreneurs note that even if the Wise listing is a success, several hurdles lie ahead for London, including the impact Brexit might have on recruiting and other long-standing issues that have plagued British tech.
""European workers seem less enthusiastic about moving to London to work,"" said Ollie Purdue, a partner at global early stage venture capital firm, Antler. ""This is both due to the difficulties around Brexit, combined with the massive efforts by other nations to boost their appeal.""
Several tech companies have listed in London in 2021 so far, pushing overall initial public offering (IPO) volumes to their highest levels on record. 
But performances has been mixed, with food delivery app Deliveroo's shares falling 30% on the first trading day.
Deliveroo's dismal debut raised the possibility that British money managers may not be as enthusiastic as their American counterparts about tech companies with huge valuations and power concentrated in the hands of the founder. 

Wise is aiming to ease any concerns with a direct listing whereby investors can decide on the valuation, while also opting for a dual-class share structure, with enhanced voting rights open to all early-stage investors and not just the founders. 
""Hopefully Wise's debut is the first of many, and momentum follows. However we can't get carried away ... We need to lay better foundations, and create the IPO environment that these home-grown superstars deserve,"" said Richard Anton, managing partner of venture capital fund Oxx.

(Reuters) - Subway is overhauling its menu and pouring money into marketing as the world's biggest restaurant chain by number of stores aims to win back customers with its new sandwiches.
The chain has floundered since co-founder Fred DeLuca died in 2015, the same year its popular spokesman Jared Fogle pleaded guilty to child pornography charges, and as it faces stiff competition from Chick-fil-A and Popeyes.
The revamped U.S. menu starting Tuesday includes Cali Fresh Turkey and All American Club sandwiches, a slew of new ingredients and two types of bread, and would address a yearslong lack of innovation, said Chief Executive Officer John Chidsey, who joined Subway in 2019.
Some items including rotisserie chicken and roast beef are being added back after the chain removed them last year to streamline operations and speed up service amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's restaurants are also replacing ""outdated"" items, such as swapping guacamole with smashed avocado, Subway executive Trevor Haynes said in an interview.
The chain is also supporting the rejig with the second-largest ad budget among restaurants behind McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and renovation of restaurants, Chidsey said, without disclosing any numbers.

Subway had experienced a few years of ""malaise"", Chidsey said in an interview. ""We just want to get back to what we consider our fair share of wallet and stomach.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The boss of Sainsbury's said on Tuesday his focus was on delivering the British supermarket group's strategy rather than the takeover frenzy that has gripped the sector.
Shares in Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest grocer after market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), are up 24% so far this year, buoyed by bid speculation.
That started in April when Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake in Sainsbury's to just under 10% and has been fuelled over the last two weeks by a bid battle for Morrisons, the No. 4 player.
Asked by reporters if Sainsbury's board had received any takeover approaches, CEO Simon Roberts said: ""If we had anything to update on, we'd be updating on it, so we've nothing to update you on.""
""I'm not going to speculate on where things are in the wider sector,"" he said.
""We're very focused on our plan. We laid out a (strategic) plan in November to really deliver improvements for our customers and improve the value that we can create for our shareholders.""
Roberts said better-than-expected trading in Sainsbury's latest quarter showed that plan was working.
The group's like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6% in the 16 weeks to June 26, its fiscal first quarter.
That was ahead of analysts' average forecast of a fall of 1.7% and compared to a rise of 11.3% in the previous quarter. 
The sharp slowdown in growth reflected a tough comparison with the same quarter last year when shoppers stocked up for the country's first COVID-19 lockdown.
Sainsbury's said it outperformed competitors and grew market share, which it said reflected lower prices, more innovation and better customer service. A further 50 million pounds of price cuts were announced on Monday.
Grocery sales were up 0.8%, online grocery sales rose 29% and clothing sales jumped 57.6%.
General merchandising sales did, however, fall 1.4%, partly reflecting ""global supply challenges"" which Sainsbury's said are likely to continue for the remainder of the year.
Despite facing further tough comparative numbers as pandemic restrictions continue to ease and customer behaviour normalises the group raised its profit outlook.
It forecast underlying pretax profit of ""at least"" 660 million pounds in the 2021-22 year, up from previous guidance of about 620 million pounds and the 356 million pounds made in 2020-21.
Industry leaders have warned that Britain could face gaps on supermarket shelves this summer due to a major shortage of truck drivers.
""We are getting products to store, but not necessarily every product,"" said Roberts.

""We're working hard to make sure we can maintain availability but clearly there are challenges in the upward supply chain.""

Investing.com – Shares of BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) were weaker during Tuesday’s premarket trading as a study from Israel pointed at their vaccine losing effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 and symptomatic cases in recent weeks.
BioNTech stock was down over 5% and Pfizer stock was down 0.6%. 
The vaccine continues to provide a strong shield against severe Covid-19, according to Israel government data.
The messenger RNA-based vaccine developed by the two companies has been one of the most effective against all the anti-Covid drugs brought to market so far.
Its success rate in protecting people against illness fell to 64% of people between June 6 and early July, down from a previous 94%, according to the stud. The drop was observed as the delta variant was spreading in Israel, the Health Ministry said. It also coincided with the lifting of virus restrictions at the start of June.
Despite the indications of increased infections, the data still showed the shot is protecting people from severe illness. Its effectiveness at preventing hospitalization fell only to 93%, according to the Health Ministry, compared with at least 97% in an earlier government study, still very effective in such cases.
Delta, which first emerged in India, is spreading around the globe as governments race to inoculate people. The mutation has forced some countries to delay or rethink plans to loosen curbs on businesses, activity and travel.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) no more enjoys liability protection against user-generated content in India as the U.S. microblogging giant has failed to comply with new IT rules, the Indian government said in a court filing.
The statement is the first time Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has officially said Twitter has lost its immunity after repeatedly criticising the company for non-compliance.
The dispute and the public spat has raised concern that American firms will find it difficult to do business amid a more stringent regulatory environment.
India's IT ministry told the High Court in New Delhi that Twitter's non-compliance amounted to a breach of the provisions of the IT Act, causing the U.S. firm to lose its immunity, according to the filing dated July 5.
The filing came in a case filed by a Twitter user who wanted to complain about some allegedly defamatory tweets on the platform, and said the company was not complying with the new law that requires appointment of certain new executives.
Twitter declined to comment. The company has previously said it was making all efforts to comply.
India's new IT rules which became effective end-May are aimed at regulating content on social media firms and making them more accountable to legal requests for swift removal of posts and sharing details on the originators of messages.
Technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has slammed Twitter for deliberately defying the law and said all social media firms must abide by the new rules.

In recent weeks, as acrimony grew between New Delhi and Twitter, Indian police have filed at least five cases against the company or its officials, including some related to child pornography and a controversial map of India on its career page.
Police in two Indian states have named Twitter India chief Manish Maheshwari in complaints. Separately, the state of Uttar Pradesh has challenged in the Supreme Court a bar on police action against Maheshwari, after a lower court protected him against arrest over an accusation that the platform was used to spread hate.

Investing.com –  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) was up 2.5% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ with a $225 target, arguing that the credit card company “is poised to exceed its original 2020 expectations by 2022”.
Analyst Ryan Nash’s latest target for American Express is 33.5% higher than the stock’s Friday closing of $168.50.
The credit card issuer had in January talked about “returning to the original EPS expectations ($8.85-$9.25) we had for 2020 in 2022.”
According to Nash, improving SME spend and benign credit should drive upside to those expectations.
“In fact, we believe American Express has the potential to see ~$10.00 in EPS in 2022 and double digit growth beyond then as the multi-year recovery in T&E (travel and entertainment) as well as robust growth in Goods & Services makes up for ""lost ground"" in 2020,” the analyst wrote.
American Express has typically depended to a large extent on business travel and hospitality spending, both of which were crippled by the pandemic but are now rebounding.

1510,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2021 06:59AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Just Lower; ISM Services Data in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, starting the new holiday-shortened week on a cautious note as oil prices rise after a group of top producers failed to agree on production levels.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%.
Crude prices rose to their highest levels in nearly seven years Tuesday the day after talks between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, broke down without agreement on a deal to boost production.
This lack of new output threatened to tighten the demand/supply balance as economies reopen around the globe, pushing prices higher and adding to near-term inflationary pressures that threaten to undermine the global economic recovery.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $76.50 a barrel, reaching its highest level since November 2014, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $77.40, climbing to its highest point since late 2018.
Still, stock market losses are likely to be limited, with the main indices near record levels, helped by a successful vaccination program, healthy economic data and strong corporate earnings underpinned by massive levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Wall Street was closed on Monday after a long weekend to celebrate Independence Day, but Friday’s June jobs report, where 850,000 jobs were created, added to the underlying positive tone.
The economic data slate Tuesday centers around the release of the ISM index of service industry activity. It is expected to show continued strong growth after hitting a record high in May, but could also underline ongoing labor market constraints.
In Europe earlier Tuesday, Eurozone monthly retail sales 4.6% on the month in May, more than expected, driven mostly by purchases of non-food products and car fuel, while investor sentiment in Germany dropped in July, but remained at a very high level. A greater source of concern may be the surprise 3% drop in German factory orders in May, given the importance of the sector for the Eurozone economy.
In corporate news, Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) stock slumped over 20% premarket and Kanzhun (NASDAQ:BZ) stock fell 10%, both hit by Chinese authorities clamping down on their business practices.
Additionally, crude stocks benefited from the higher oil prices, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock up 0.9%,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 0.9% and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) stock up 1.8%.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,807.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1841.

CAIRO (Reuters) -Egypt's competition authority has approved a request by 23 cement makers to reduce production temporarily to help reduce a glut in output, setting a baseline cut at 10.69%, a document seen by Reuters shows.
The competition authority decision, dated July 5, said there would be additional cuts of 2.81% for each production line and further cuts depending on the company's age.
The quotas would come into force on July 15 and remain in place for one year, the document said.
Egypt's cement production capacity has risen significantly in the last three years after the inauguration of the 13 million tonne-per-year plant owned by the military in Beni Suef, even as local sales halved, cement executives say.
The sector is seen as an indicator of Egypt's openness to foreign investment, which it has struggled to attract.

Companies, including Germany's HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), France's Vicat, Switzerland's LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY), Greece's Titan Cement and Mexico's CEMEX, invested heavily in Egypt after a privatisation drive that began in the 1990s. Local players set up their own plants later.
Egypt-based executives had welcomed an earlier, draft proposal for production quotas, but two had told Reuters that they thought the formula appeared unfair to foreign companies.

The Cyberspace Administration of China has stopped it from onboarding any more users until it is satisfied that its data collection and retention complies with national law.
“The company plans to conduct a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and continue to enhance its cybersecurity awareness and technology capabilities,” Kanzhun said in a press release.
Apart from the suspension of new user registration of the ‘BOSS Zhipin’ app in China, the company said it is operating normally.
Kanzhun joins the list of tech-based companies in China whose operations are under review by the CAC. With many Chinese internet companies listed in the U.S., there are concerns in the communist country over the trove of user data they may have to share as part of disclosure norms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Didi (NYSE:DIDI) is under a similar review. The Chinese regulator told app stores over the weekend to take the ride-hailing app of their platforms. Didi shares were down by over 20% in premarket today."

Investing.com – Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) was trading more than 20% lower in Monday’s premarket trading as authorities in China blocked the company from accepting new users and told mobile app stores to take the ride-hailing app off their platforms.
Reports says the authorities in China are concerned over the vast troves of consumer data the company possesses. Didi is now a listed company in the U.S. and therefore has to make disclosures to comply with the norms laid down by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a scenario the Chinese authorities may not be very comfortable with.
A WSJ report said China’s cybersecurity watchdog had suggested the Chinese giant delay its initial public offering and urged it to conduct a thorough self-examination of its network security. Didi listed on the NYSE on Wednesday, reportedly under pressure from early investors looking to cash out. It closed Friday’s session at a market cap of $18.51 billion. Markets were shut in the U.S. on June 5 on account of Independence Day.
The move is also likely to be reflected in SoftBank (OTC:SFTBY) ADRs, given that the Japanese company is a big investor in Didi. Softbank's shares in Japan fell over 5% on Monday but recovered by 1% on Tuesday.

At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 outperformed, gaining 0.1%.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, abandoned oil output talks on Monday, after failing to agree a deal to boost production.
Any production deals within the group have to be agreed unanimously, and the United Arab Emirates rejected a proposal that would have increased output by about 2 million barrels a day between August and December 2021, as well as keeping the remaining limits on output to the end of 2022.
The lack of agreement helped push oil prices to their highest levels in nearly three years, adding to near-term inflationary pressures that threaten to undermine the global economic recovery.
At 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% higher at $76.87 a barrel, reaching its highest level since October 2018, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $77.71, climbing about $77 a barrel for the first time since 2018 this week.
On the flip side, these oil price gains helped the oil majors strengthen Tuesday, with BP (NYSE:BP) stock up 1%, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock 1.9% higher, Eni (MI:ENI) stock up 0.8% and Total stock 0.9% higher.
Elsewhere, German factory orders slumped 3.7% in May, significantly below the 1.0% rise expected, driven by weak export demand for cars, a sign that the global chip shortage is taking an ever more serious toll on industry more broadly.
Economic data also scheduled for release Tuesday include Eurozone retail sales and the ZEW survey of economic sentiment in Germany for July.
On a more positive note, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined plans on Monday to end all restrictions put in place to combat the Covid-19 virus in two weeks, and Germany announced plans to lift travel restrictions on fully vaccinated travelers from the U.K., and Portugal, from Wednesday.
In corporate news, J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) stock rose 0.1% as investors weighed up the British supermarket chain beating expectations for first-quarter sales with a sharp slowdown from last year when shoppers prepared for the first Covid-19 lockdown.
Ocado stock rose 3.8% after the British online grocer announced a 20% rise in revenue for its first half, as well as a deal to develop Alcampo's online business in Spain. The stock has still lost more than one-third of its value from last year's peak, when euphoria about the acceleration of online shopping made it a standout performer. Meanwhile in Germany, another winner from the shift to online shopping - Shop Apotheke Europe (DE:SAEG) stock - fell 8% after the pharmacy warned of slowing sales growth.

The announcement late on Monday comes after the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in February went offline for nearly four hours, leaving investors clueless as to when trading would resume and drawing the ire of brokers forced to sell holdings..
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its announcement said stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories and their senior management will be fined for not promptly resolving issues or not submitting root-cause analyses within 21 days.
An entity's failure to declare disruption to critical systems as a ""disaster"" within 30 minutes, and failure to restore operations within 45 minutes, will in each case attract a penalty of 20 million rupees ($269,070) or 10% of the average of the two previous financial years' net profit, whichever is higher, SEBI said.
The managing director and chief technology officer of the entity will also be fined 10% of annual pay, the regulator said.
The penalties will encourage entities ""to constantly monitor the performance and efficiency of their systems,"" and avoid, or quickly tackle, disruption, SEBI said.
In February, during the NSE shutdown, some brokers said a lack of swift information on when, or whether, trading would resume prompted them to close intra-day equity positions on another exchange, leading to significant loss for some investors.

NSE said it had acted in accordance with standard practices.

The new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows the Qatari fund was among the investors who subscribed to Credit Suisse's capital raising in April when the Swiss lender issued mandatory convertible notes. 
Stock exchange data still shows QIA's stake of 4.84%, however the stake rises to 6.01% if the convertibles are taken into account, the new filing shows. 

Credit Suisse in April said the mandatory convertible notes will be converted upon six month maturity, but they could be subject to early conversion upon the occurrence of certain events.
Credit Suisse has raised capital, halted share buybacks, cut its dividend and revamped management after losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of family office Archegos and suspending funds linked to Greensill.

Glass Lewis said it was making the recommendation after an Australian court in August found that Adani Abbot Point Terminal Pty Ltd, a coal export terminal in the state of Queensland, engaged in monopolistic business practices. It awarded four companies that used the terminal a combined A$107 million ($80.7 million).
An Adani spokesperson said, however, that the Abbot Point Terminal was a separate company, and was not part of Adani Enterprises. The port operator is owned by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. 
The nominee, Pranav Adani, is the sole member of the Adani Enterprises' risk committee up for re-election at its annual general meeting on July 12.

Adani Enterprises' Australian unit, Bravus Mining & Resources, is developing the Carmichael mine in Queensland to sell thermal coal to India - a controversial project due to concerns about global warming. The coal will be transported via the Abbot Point Terminal.

As Beijing probes Didi Global Inc. -- China’s version of Uber (NYSE:UBER) -- and two other firms that recently debuted on Wall Street, global equity managers are questioning if the regulatory threat posed by the Asian nation’s increasing efforts to control big data is a risk worth taking.
“The Didi situation reinforces the fact that China is annoyed by the flood of U.S. IPOs by Chinese tech companies, and is attempting to slow the reception of these IPOs in the West,” said Hans Albrecht, portfolio manager at Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. “While Chinese names look like better value, they will suffer from this overhang for some time.”
Beijing’s latest crackdown on the technology industry threatens to chill investor sentiment at a time when there are as many as 34 pending filings for U.S. listings by firms based in China or Hong Kong announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Such deals have been running at a record pace, with more than $15 billion priced in New York IPOs so far this year.
QuickTake: What Is Didi and Why Is China Cracking Down on It?
Didi’s shares slid more than 5% on Friday as China said it’s starting a cybersecurity review of the ride-hailing company. Two days after that, the regulator said the firm had committed serious violations in the collection and usage of personal information. It then ordered the company’s app to be removed from stores.
Investors will be keenly watching the stock as trading resumes in the U.S. after Monday’s holiday. China is also probing Kanzhun Ltd., the owner of an online recruitment platform, and Full Truck Alliance Co., an Uber-like trucking startup. Both companies listed in the U.S. recently.
“The Chinese government could have stopped the IPOs from happening, like how they did with Ant,” said Sharif Farha, a Dubai-based portfolio manager at Safehouse Global Consumer Fund. “Instead, they allowed global investors to take pain, and consequently have broken trust with a lot of foreign investors. While we did not participate in any of these listings, we would imagine that several funds would consider exiting.”
One company poised to test sentiment soon is Hong Kong’s on-demand logistics and delivery firm Lalamove. It filed confidentially for a U.S. initial public offering last month, according to people with knowledge of the matter, and is seeking to raise at least $1 billion.
The latest crackdown is “very bad news for these Chinese companies’ image abroad,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Group Holdings SA. “It’s a terrible hit to foreign investor appetite.”

The group, which trails market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) in annual sales, said like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6% in the 16 weeks to June 26, its fiscal first quarter - versus analysts' average forecast of a fall of 1.7% and a rise of 11.3% in the previous quarter.
Sainsbury's said sales of grocery, general merchandise and clothing were all higher than its expectations throughout the quarter. It said it outperformed competitors and grew market share.
It said it had further tough comparables ahead as pandemic restrictions continue to ease and customer behaviour normalises.
Sainsbury's said it expected to report underlying profit before tax of at least 660 million pounds ($917 million) in the 2021-22 year, up from 356 million pounds in 2020-21.
Shares in Sainsbury's are up 23% so far this year, buoyed by bid speculation.

That started in April when Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake to just under 10% and has been fueled over the last two weeks by a bid battle for rival Morrisons.

Steve McCann told a Victoria state inquiry ""many things"" concerned him before starting last month at the company, where a regulator had found links with organised crime and inappropriate control of the board from billionaire shareholder James Packer.
The regulator, in the state of New South Wales, found Crown unsuitable for a gambling licence at a just-opened, A$2.2 billion ($1.67 billion) resort in Sydney. That prompted numerous top-level departures - including of McCann's predecessor - and triggered inquiries in Victoria and Western Australia states where Crown operates its two casinos.
""There is a very significant population of Crown who are crying out for the ability to speak up, the ability to be involved, the ability to restore the pride in the organisation that they used to feel but is currently challenged because their family and friends are struggling with what's going on,"" McCann, formerly CEO at property giant LendLease Group (OTC:LLESY), said at the Victoria inquiry.
""There are a lot of people who are concerned about their future. If they feel uncomfortable, they should speak up. I'm not asking them to do something that's inconsistent with their values,"" he said, in his first public remarks since joining the company.
In February, the New South Wales regulator said Crown needed sweeping change to its board and culture to be suitable for a Sydney gambling licence. That followed a year of hearings which aired claims of money laundering, governance failure and indifference to the safety of 19 staff jailed in China in 2016 for breaking that country's anti-gambling law.
At the Victoria inquiry on Tuesday, McCann, who is yet to receive regulatory clearance to run a casino, acknowledged he was not told about underpayment of hundreds of millions of dollars of gambling tax until six days into the CEO role, but rejected suggestions the delay indicated poor governance.
""I didn't find it surprising or concerning because the organisation had been under the impression that it had disclosed what it thought it needed to disclose,"" he said.

""It was obviously disappointing now that I know what I know, but there was lot of activity around trying to disclose everything.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Tuesday, as investors digest the collapse in talks over oil production levels between a group of major producers and the associated rise in prices. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, abandoned oil output talks on Monday, carried over from Friday, after failing to agree a deal to boost production.
Any production deals within the group have to be agreed unanimously, and the United Arab Emirates rejected a proposal that would have increased output by about 2 million barrels a day between August and December 2021, as well as keeping the remaining limits on output to the end of 2022.
The lack of agreement helped push oil prices to their highest levels in nearly three years, adding to near-term inflationary pressures that threaten to undermine the global economic recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $76.70 a barrel, reaching its highest level since October 2018, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $77.46, climbing about $77 a barrel for the first time since 2018 this week.
Still, losses are likely to be limited in Europe Tuesday as the markets lack a strong lead.  U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Independence Day holiday.
On a more positive note, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined plans on Monday to end all restrictions put in place to combat the Covid-19 virus in two weeks, even though the number of cases associated with the highly contagious delta variant is still increasing.
Additionally, Germany announced plans to lift travel restrictions on fully vaccinated travelers from the U.K., and Portugal, from Wednesday, raising hopes of a summer vacation season.
German industrial orders slumped 3.7% in May, significantly below the rise of 1.0% expected, and the European data slate also includes Eurozone retail sales and the ZEW survey of economic sentiment in Germany for July.

Investing.com – Suning.com Co. has raised $1.36 billion in a state-backed bailout for its listed retail arm, in China's latest effort to clean up the indebted conglomerates.
Suning's (SZ:002024) Shenzhen shares soared 10.02% by 1:14 AM ET (5:14 AM GMT) to CNY6.15 ($0.95), after a previous filing for a trading halt on Jun. 16 due to debt pressure.
Led by the Nanjing state asset management committee and the Jiangsu provincial government,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988), Midea Group Co., Haier Group Co., Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp., and TCL Technology Group Corp. were among the investors that participated in the bailout, according to a statement released on Monday. They will gain a 16.96% stake in Suning, although no major shareholders will have a controlling stake. 
The deal was struck at CNY5.59 yuan a share, a near eight-year low, and the group will gain a 16.96% stake in Suning, although no major shareholders will have a controlling stake. Chinese billionaire Zhang Jindong, who is also the company's founder and largest shareholder, will no longer control Suning after the bailout.
“The diversified investor portfolio helps push Suning.com to further improve the corporate governance, operations and business transformation as a retail service provider… the fund will actively support Suning to grow healthily and stably,” the company said in a statement.
In a separate statement released on Monday, the retail arm of Suning said it posted a loss of CNY2.5 to CNY3.2 billion in the first half of 2021.
Suning.com, one of China’s biggest retailers of appliances, electronics and other consumer goods, was valued at about CNY52 billion before the trading halt. Its retail business was hurt during COVID-19 and investors were concerned about its cash flow in September 2020 when Zhang waived his right to a 20 billion yuan payment from property developer China Evergrande Group."

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 11:22PM ET</span>",Didi cybersecurity probe blindsides shareholders days after debut,"By Julie Zhu, Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have gained a reputation for aggressive action, but even hardened investors were shocked by the announcement of a probe into ride-hailing firm Didi just two days after its $4.4 billion New York stock market debut.
While Didi's initial public offering (IPO) prospectus did mention some of the regulatory risks to its operations, there was no indication that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) would begin investigating the company and ban it from accepting new users during the review.
Didi said on Monday it was not aware of the probe announced by the CAC on July 2, which sent its shares as much as 10% lower, before its IPO. The stock closed down 5.3% and will not trade Monday due to the U.S. holiday.
The CAC followed up two days later with an order for Didi's app to be removed from app stores in China, saying the company had illegally collected users' personal data.
""Prior to the IPO, Didi had no knowledge of the CAC's decisions, announced on July 2 and July 4, 2021, with respect to the cybersecurity review and suspension of new user registrations in China, and the removal of the Didi Chuxing app from the app stores in China, respectively,"" Didi said in a statement sent to Reuters.
News that the order to remove the apps from sale caught six fund investors who had attended Didi's IPO roadshow, including two of whom were allocated stock in the deal, off guard.
One hedge fund source, who could not be named as he was not permitted to speak to the media, said the CAC news was bizarre and unexpected given it came so soon after the IPO.
The CAC said its action was to protect national security and the public interest, but spooked investors said the timing would cast a shadow over plans by other Chinese tech companies to list in the United States or raise funds in global markets.
The move was interpreted as a ratcheting up of pressure on Chinese tech companies, which started with the scuttling of a $37 billion listing planned by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fintech affiliate Ant Group late last year. 
""The (Chinese Communist) Party had previously targeted Ant Group, which was planning an IPO and was forced to cancel,"" said Ryan Fedasiuk, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. 
""But this step is an escalation because it is retroactive, effectively punishing investors that participated in a completed IPO. The CAC commenced review and suspended Didi's presence on Chinese app stores just days after its public debut,"" he added.
On Monday, Didi said the order to remove its app from stores in China could hurt revenue.
""It caught everyone by surprise, but occasional antitrust action is what we could expect from tech names,"" Edison Pun, senior market analyst at Saxo Markets, said of the move.
""The suspension (of Didi's app download) will definitely hurt investment confidence as it's just listed in the U.S. market, and that will need time to allow the investors to adjust to valuation,"" Pun added.
'NEW JOURNEY' FOR DIDI 
Didi is also being probed by China's State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) antitrust watchdog over whether it used anti-competitive practices to drive out smaller rivals unfairly, Reuters reported last month.
The SAMR probe is also looking into whether the pricing mechanism of its ride-hailing business is transparent enough.
Didi, which dominates China's ride-hailing market, said at the time it would not comment on speculation.
Didi listed in New York on June 30, after roadshows and pre-deal investor education meetings and calls from June 11. The IPO valued it at $67.5 billion, down from as much as $100 billion Didi had hoped for earlier this year, after investors baulked at the pace and profitability of its expansion.
Most of Didi's roadshows were fronted by Didi co-founder Jean Liu, senior vice president Stephen Zhu and head of capital markets David Xu and they mostly talked about its operations and business growth, people who attended the briefings said. 
There was little information about regulatory issues offered at the briefings, beyond what was disclosed in Didi's prospectus, they added.
Didi did mention China's new Data Security Law in its IPO prospectus, which is due to take effect in September, saying this may require adjustments to its business practices. 
Unusually for a Chinese firm, Didi made its debut with little fanfare.
""We did not ring the bell or celebrate (the listing) conspicuously, because the listing is not the end, but the beginning of a new journey,"" a letter sent by founder Will Cheng and Liu to Didi staff on Wednesday said.
""That means that we need to be more open and transparent, and we need to shoulder more social responsibilities and expectations,"" a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, showed.
Didi did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

For Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at Everbright Sun Hung Kai, the CAC action raises concerns of more to come.
""The fallout from the SAMR investigation that Didi mentioned in its prospectus has yet to be borne out. The prospect of fines from the SAMR side still looms,"" Short said.

In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.18% ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)’s policy decision, due later in the day. RBA is expected to start withdrawing some stimulus measures in the decision, even as the latest outbreak of COVID-19 saw restrictive measures implemented in several cities.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.17%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.04% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.23%. The country will release its consumer price index and producer price index on Friday.
Investors also kept a wary eye on the market after the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered app stores to remove Didi from their offerings earlier in the week, with the crackdown coming just days after the ride-hailing giant listed in New York.
U.S. markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.
OPEC+ abandoned its latest talks that took place on Monday and were aimed at resolving a worsening dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over output levels.
The talks’ collapse also raised the specter of a price war not dissimilar to the Saudi Arabia-Russia price war that caused the black liquid’s price to enter negative territory in April 2020. The collapse also means that the output hike scheduled for August will not take place, likely leading to a shortage of barrels just as some countries continue their economic recovery from COVID-19.
The inevitable higher energy prices could also further stoke existing inflationary pressures, which could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering sooner than expected. Investors now await the minutes from the Fed’s June policy meeting, due on Wednesday, to further understand the central bank’s surprise hawkish turn at that meeting.
On the data front, the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June is due later in the day.
The risk of oil at $100 a barrel “is so correlated with short-run inflation that it will make the market very, very edgy, and we know that the Fed is both watching the economic data but also markets,” Coutts & Co. chief investment officer Alan Higgins told Bloomberg.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand is considering introducing a tax on share sales by individual investors on its stock exchange to generate additional revenue, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The government is studying the possibility of ending a tax waiver, which has been in place since 1991, on securities sales on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, two sources said. 
The tax of 0.11% on equities sales would apply to investors with a volume of more than one million baht ($31,140) per month, a source said. 
""The government wants to find ways to generate more revenue, but this plan could spook investors,"" the source said. 
The idea is similar to a Tobin tax that is applied on financial transactions akin to those in India and Taiwan. 
The Thai bourse did not respond to a request for comment. 
""It's part of the government's tax reform agenda,"" another source familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding the proposal was only in the preliminary stages. 
They are just studying the impact and weighing benefits and costs, the source said. 
""When you look at tax reform, you have to look at everything in the country."" 
The Thai plan was to collect tax from the wealthy and was only at a conceptual stage with no time frame, a third source said. 
Thailand currently collects a capital gains tax from local and foreign institutions, but individual traders are exempt. The main stock index is up 9% this year.

The two crew members on Transair Flight 810 were injured after being forced to land in the Pacific Ocean early on Friday, the NTSB said. The agency did not disclose the extent of their injuries. 
The crew reported engine trouble and plans to turn back shortly after taking off at 1:33 a.m. local time from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. The plane was en route to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter, responding to reports of the downed plane, spotted a debris field and found one crew member clinging to the plane's tail roughly an hour after takeoff. Another survivor was found using packages as a flotation device.

One crew member was taken to a hospital by helicopter and the other was rescued by boat.

The South Korean tech giant's strong performance - coming despite it shipping fewer smartphones than in January-March - underscores the stratospheric demand for chips that has depleted stockpiles and filled production capacity.
The result would be up 20% from the first quarter and mark Samsung (KS:005930)'s highest operating income for the second quarter since 2018. Revenue likely rose 15.4%.
Samsung is scheduled to announce preliminary second-quarter results on Wednesday.
The company's chip division likely benefited from memory chip price hikes that exceeded market estimates, analysts said, while shipments grew as well.
Prices of DRAM chips, widely used in servers, mobile phones and other computing devices, jumped 27% compared to the March quarter, while those of NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market rose 8.6%, according to research provider Trendforce. 
Profit also improved at Samsung's chip-contract manufacturing and logic chip design business, partly because operations at its storm-hit Texas factory returned to normal, analysts said.
They estimated the chip division's operating profit in April-June rose about 22% from the year-earlier period to about 6.6 trillion won.
Still, Samsung's smartphone shipments dropped to about 59 million in April-June from about 76 million in the first quarter, according to Shinyoung Investment & Securities, as sales slowed for its latest flagship model, launched in mid-January.

Reduced demand from India, hard hit by the pandemic during the quarter, as well as tight supply for some mobile processor chips may also have affected shipments, analysts said, estimating the mobile business' operating profit at about 2.9 trillion won.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>","Coop, other ransomware-hit firms, could take weeks to recover, say experts","By Supantha Mukherjee and Colm Fulton
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Computer systems of several companies across the world, including 800 physical grocery stores of Sweden's Coop, that were shut down after attacked by REvil ransomware could take weeks to recover, cyber security experts said.
Hackers from the REvil cybercrime gang compromised systems of IT firm Kaseya and malware trickled down to its resellers and reached end customers such as Coop who used its software. 
The ransomware locked data in encrypted files and late on Sunday hackers demanded $70 million to restore the data.
The REvil actors had claimed that a million machines were compromised, said Mark Loman, director of engineering at cybersecurity firm Sophos. 
""Depending on how big your business is and if you have backups, it can take weeks before you have restored everything, and as the supermarkets in Sweden have been impacted, they can lose a lot of food and revenue,"" he said.
Coop's grocery store chain had to close hundreds of stores on Saturday because its cash registers are run by Visma Esscom, which manages servers for a number of Swedish businesses and in turn uses Kaseya.
""We have stopped the attack and we are now restarting our systems,"" a Coop spokesperson said. 
""We are recovering the systems and have now technicians who are visiting all of the affected stores to recover the data systems,"" they added.
Visma Esscom did not respond to requests for comment.
While many Coop stores remained closed on Monday, some stores have opened their doors and were allowing customers to pay by using an app called ""Scan and Pay."" 
""I don't think we have seen anything this large scale before,"" said Anders Nilsson, chief technology officer at ESET Nordics. ""This is the first time we are seeing a grocery not been able to process payments and this shows how vulnerable we are.""
To fix the issues, Coop's payment provider needs to physically go to all stores and restore payment machines manually from backups. 
As is routine, the hackers created a channel for negotiating with the victims of the ransomware attack.
Speaking in this online chatroom, which Reuters was able to access, a representative for a REvil affiliate said the hackers had no regrets about forcing Coop to close.
""It's nothing more than a business,"" the representative told Reuters when asked about the impact of shutting supermarkets in Sweden.
The representative said that while the gang was seeking $70 million to restore all the data from all the victims, ""we are always ready to negotiate.""
ESET's Nilsson said, ""It doesn't really matter if they pay or not, they are still going to take time to restore all the machines."" 
Colonial Pipeline faced an extortion attack earlier this year, causing a shutdown lasting several days. The company paid the hackers nearly $5 million to regain access.

""Paying a ransom is just putting the fire out but it will not make your environment more secure,"" said David Jacoby, deputy director at Kaspersky.
""The companies should not pay the ransom, because we don't want to encourage cyber criminals that this is something that's profitable.""

The law, signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, requires all foreign producers of sparkling wine to describe their product as such on the back of the bottle - though not on the front - while makers of Russian ""shampanskoye"" may continue to use that term alone.
The French champagne industry group called on its members to halt all shipments to Russia for the time being and said the name ""champagne"", which refers to the region in France where the drink comes from, had legal protection in 120 countries.
""The Champagne Committee deplores the fact that this legislation does not ensure that Russian consumers have clear and transparent information about the origins and characteristics of wine,"" Maxime Toubart and Jean-Marie Barillere, the group's co-presidents, said in a statement. 
French Trade Minister Franck Riester said he was tracking the new Russian law closely, and was in contact with the wine industry and France's European partners. 
""We will unfailingly support our producers and French excellence,"" he said on Twitter.
Moet Hennessy, the LVMH-owned French maker of Veuve Clicquot and Dom Perignon champagnes, said on Sunday it would begin adding the designation ""sparkling wine"" to the back of bottles destined for Russia to comply with the law. 
LVMH shares were down around 0.2% on Monday afternoon, underperforming the Paris bourse, which was up 0.34%.
Shares in Russian sparkling wine maker Abrau-Durso were up more than 3% after rising as much as 7.77% in early trading.
Pavel Titov, the president of Abrau-Durso, told Radio France Internationale on Saturday his firm does not have sparkling wines that would be called ""champagne"" in its portfolio and said he hoped the issue would be resolved in favor of global norms and standards.
""It is very important to protect the Russian wines on our market. But the legislation must be reasonable and not contradict common sense ... I have no doubts that the real champagne is made in the Champagne region of France,"" he said. 
The European Commission said the legislation in Russia regarding spirits and wine would have a considerable impact on wine exports and would do all it could to express its disagreement and concern. 

""We will do everything necessary to protect our rights and take the necessary steps if this law enters into force,"" European Commission spokeswoman Miriam Garcia Ferrer said.
Asked what counter-measures the European Union could take in response to the Russian law, she said it was premature to discuss such a situation.

It isn’t known whether Didi carried out its own review, according to the WSJ report. [https://on.wsj.com/3jKuGWx] But a person close to the company told the newspaper the company ultimately decided to go ahead with the IPO as it faced increasing investor pressure for a big payout.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) launched the investigation into Didi on Friday, just two days after the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
On Sunday, the agency ordered a suspension of app downloads for Didi after it found the company illegally collected personal user data.
Didi said in a statement on Monday it had no knowledge before its $4.4 billion listing that CAC would start to investigate the company and order its app to be taken down.
Officials in Beijing, especially those at CAC, were wary of the ride-hailing giant’s troves of data potentially falling into foreign hands as a result of the greater public disclosure associated with a U.S. listing, according to the WSJ report. 

Chinese internet regulators have tightened rules for the country's tech giants in recent years, asking companies to collect, store and handle key data properly.
Didi, which offers services in China and more than 15 other markets, gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data every day.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks stayed close to record highs on Monday as investors weighed surging European business activity and a welcome U.S. jobs report against worries about the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19.
The STOXX index of 600 leading European companies was 0.3% higher, reversing earlier losses after data showed euro zone businesses expanded activity at the fastest rate in 15 years in June.
Activity for British services firms also soared in June, albeit at a slightly slower rate.
Britain's FTSE was up 0.5% ahead of an announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson at 1600 GMT expected to confirm an end to COVID-19 restrictive measures in England on July 19.
French shares also recouped losses sustained after Health Minister Olivier Veran warned that France could be heading for a fourth wave of the pandemic due to the Delta variant.
COVID-19 angst also weighed on shares in Japan: The Nikkei fell 0.6% to a two-week low following a surge in infections in Tokyo, just weeks before the city hosts the Olympics.
Japan's services sector activity shrank for the 17th straight month in June, a survey showed.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat.
China's blue-chip stock index recovered from earlier losses to close 0.1% higher as pledges by Beijing to continue policy support for its tech sector helped counter worries about a crackdown on ride-hailing giant Didi Global and scrutiny of other platform companies in the country.
The MSCI All Country World index closed at a record 724.66 last week, and was 0.1% higher on Monday.
Trading was thinner than usual with U.S. markets closed for the extended 4th of July weekend.
""Markets in general are still trying to find their feet,"" said James Athey, investment director, Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""Equities, of course, continue to shrug off or ignore anything that might be considered remotely negative as they continue their merry and complacent dance towards an inevitable reckoning.""
S&P 500 futures signalled a flat open for Tuesday, after the index closed 0.8% higher at a record on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.8%. setting another record. (N)
U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by a bigger-than-expected 850,000 jobs last month, data on Friday showed. But the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 5.9% from 5.8%, while the closely watched average hourly earnings, a gauge of wage inflation, rose 0.3% last month, lower than the consensus forecast for a 0.4% increase.
""The goldilocks print suggests there is no need to accelerate the tapering timeline or the implied rate hike profile,"" Tapas Strickland, an analyst at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), wrote in a client note.
""Overall the level of payrolls is still 6.8 million below pre-pandemic February 2020 levels, and is still below the level of substantial progress needed by the Fed. As such there is nothing in this report for the Fed to become hawkish about.""
Eyes will be trained on the minutes of the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting from last month, when policymakers surprised markets by signalling two rate hikes by the end of 2023.
Commentary by Fed officials since then has been more balanced, particularly from Chair Jerome Powell, as investors parse Wednesday's release for further clues on the timing of policy tightening.
Euro zone government bond yields nudged higher but analysts expect the recent downward trajectory to resume after the U.S. payrolls data.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up by one basis point at -0.222%. 
The dollar flagged after dropping from a three-month high at the end of last week, pressured by the weaker details of the U.S. payrolls report.
It gained about 0.2% against the New Zealand dollar, which sat at $0.7022, traded 0.1% lower at 110.92 yen and fell 0.1% to $1.1876 per euro.
Gold was up 0.3% to $1,791.29 an ounce.
Crude oil climbed as OPEC+ talks dragged on. Saudi Arabia's energy minister pushed back on Sunday against opposition by fellow Gulf producer the United Arab Emirates to a proposed OPEC+ deal and called for ""compromise and rationality"" to secure agreement when the group reconvenes on Monday.

Brent crude added 0.2% to $76.32 a barrel, and U.S. crude gained 0.2% to $75.31 a barrel. [O/R]

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",Sydney Airport gets $16.7 billion buyout bid as investors take longer-term view on travel,"(Fixes dropped A$ to denote Australian dollars in paragraph 1)
By Jamie Freed and Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A group of infrastructure investors has proposed a A$22.26 billion ($16.7 billion) buyout of Sydney Airport Holdings Pty Ltd, the operator of Australia's biggest airport, taking a longer-term view on the pandemic-battered travel sector.
Record-low interest rates have led pension funds and their investment managers to chase higher yields. The purchase, with an enterprise value of A$30 billion including debt, would allow them to reap financial benefits when borders reopen and travel demand rebounds.
If successful, the deal would be Australia's biggest this year, eclipsing the $8.1 billion spin-off of Endeavour Group Ltd and Star Entertainment Group Ltd's $7.3 billion bid for Crown Resorts Ltd.
The Sydney Aviation Alliance - a consortium comprising IFM Investors, QSuper and Global Infrastructure Partners - has offered A$8.25 per Sydney Airport share, a 42% premium to the stock's Friday close.
The news sent the stock up as much as 38% to A$8.04 in early Monday trade, though it later retreated to around A$7.55, indicating market uncertainty as to whether the deal will succeed.
Sydney Airport noted the offer was below its pre-pandemic share price and said it would review the proposal, which is contingent on granting due diligence and recommending it to shareholders in the absence of a superior offer.
The airport operator's share price hit a record A$8.86 in January last year, before the novel coronavirus pandemic led to a collapse in travel demand.
The company is Australia's only listed airport operator. A successful deal would bring its ownership in line with the country's other major airports which are owned by consortia of infrastructure investors, primarily pension funds.
Australia's mandatory retirement savings system, known as superannuation, has assets of A$3.1 trillion, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. 
With record-low interest rates, funds are looking at infrastructure investments for higher yields.
""It's the right timing to be looking at these assets which have got a 75-year life when conditions are arguably at the bottom,"" said a Sydney Airport investor who declined to be named because the person's firm was still assessing the proposal. ""It's opportunistic in that regard, but understandable.""
Australia's international borders are widely expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year due partly to a slower vaccination programme than in most developed countries.
Domestic travel has also been disrupted by a two-week lockdown in Sydney during the normally busy school holiday period, after an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19. Other states have closed borders to Sydney residents.
In May, Sydney Airport's international traffic was down more than 93% versus the same month of 2019, while domestic traffic was down 39.2%.
The airport has long held a monopoly on traffic to and from Australia's most populous city, but that is due to end in 2026 with the opening of Western Sydney Airport.
Sydney Aviation Alliance said it did not anticipate making substantive changes to the airport's management, services, operations or target credit ratings.
The consortium said its members invest directly or indirectly on behalf of more than 6 million Australians and collectively have more than A$177 billion of infrastructure funds under management globally, including stakes in 20 airports.
IFM holds stakes in major airports in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. QSuper owns a stake in Britain's Heathrow Airport whereas Global Infrastructure is invested in that country's Gatwick and London City airports.
Their offer is contingent on UniSuper, Sydney Airport's largest shareholder with a 15% stake, agreeing to reinvest its equity interest for an equivalent equity holding in the consortium's vehicle.
UniSuper, which also holds stakes in Adelaide and Brisbane airports, said it was not a consortium partner nor privy to any details outside information disclosed publicly.

""UniSuper does however, in-principle, see merit in Sydney Airport being converted from a publicly listed company to an unlisted company. UniSuper also has a favourable view of the consortium partners,"" the fund said.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",Factbox-Supermarket sweep: $9 billion battle for Britain's Morrisons,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -An $8.7 billion battle for Britain's Morrisons heated up when a third private equity group entered the fray on Monday and the supermarket group's share price outstripped the value of an offer it recommended on Saturday.
Following are some details about the bidders for the 122-year-old grocery group, which is Britain's fourth largest supermarket chain with 500 stores and is based in Bradford, northern England.
FORTRESS LED CONSORTIUM
Morrisons agreed a 6.3 billion pound ($8.7 billion) takeover led by the SoftBank owned Fortress Investment Group and backed by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments on Saturday.
The consortium, which Morrisons had secretly been talking to since May 4, has pledged to maintain the Bradford headquarters and its existing management team led by CEO David Potts and pursue its existing strategy. It said material store sale and leaseback transactions were not planned.
That could prove more attractive to the British government after the opposition Labour party voiced concern over the impact on jobs and food manufacturing, with the coronavirus pandemic bringing home the need to keep it local.
Fortress bought British wine seller Majestic Wine for 95 million pounds in 2019.
CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE (CD&R)
The U.S. private equity group revealed on June 19 that it was considering a cash offer. Morrisons said a 5.52 billion pound proposal was made on June 14 and rejected on June 17.
Terry Leahy, the former boss of Britain's market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), is a senior adviser to CD&R.
CD&R has not detailed its plans for Morrisons. However, there has been speculation that CD&R wants to sell and lease back some stores and open Morrisons convenience stores at the Motor Fuels Group petrol forecourt chain it owns.
CD&R is yet to clarify its intentions.
APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT
Apollo, another U.S. private equity group, said on Monday it was in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer for Morrisons but said no approach has been made to its board.
Apollo has shown itself to be keen on UK supermarket assets as it chased Asda, Britain's No. 3 grocer, last year before losing out to brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and TDR Capital, which bought a majority stake from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in a 6.8 billion pound deal.
OTHER POSSIBLE BIDDERS?
Analysts have speculated that other private equity players could join in, noting that Lone Star was also interested in Asda.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with whom Morrisons has a longstanding supplier partnership deal, has also been talked about as a possible bidder to secure a major physical presence in Britain's food retail market, one of the most advanced in online delivery. 
Competition rules would preclude any one of Tesco, No. 2 Sainsbury's or Asda taking over Morrisons.
Britain's competition regulator blocked Sainsbury's agreed takeover of Asda in 2019. 
WHAT NEXT?
Fortress' recommended offer is the only firm one on the table. 
A circular from Morrisons detailing Fortress' offer must go to shareholders within 28 days of July 3.
The circular will contain a notice of a court meeting and a general meeting for shareholders to vote on the proposal.
When it has a date for the shareholder meetings, the Takeover Panel will then set a deadline by which CD&R and Apollo and any other suitor who has been publicly identified as a possible bidder needs to clarify their intentions.
Such a ""put up or shut up"" deadline would normally be seven days ahead of the shareholder meetings.

Although Morrisons' directors have committed to vote in favour of the Fortress proposal, this does not commit other shareholders to doing the same and the board has a fiduciary duty to consider any other offers.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Nordic fund KLP excludes 16 companies over links to Israeli settlements in West Bank,"By Gwladys Fouche and Simon Jessop
OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's largest pension fund KLP said on Monday it would no longer invest in 16 companies including  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Motorola because of their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Along with a number of other countries, Norway considers the settlements a breach of international law. Israel disputes this and cites Biblical and historical ties to the land, as well as security needs. 
A 2020 United Nations report said it had found 112 companies that have operations linked to the West Bank, captured by Israel in a 1967 war and now home to around 450,000 Israelis and 3 million Palestinians.
The companies, which span telecoms, banking, energy and construction, all help facilitate Israel's presence and therefore risk being complicit in breaches of international law, and against KLP's ethical guidelines, it said in a statement.
""In KLP's assessment, there is an unacceptable risk that the excluded companies are contributing to the abuse of human rights in situations of war and conflict through their links with the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank,"" KLP said.
The move by KLP follows a decision by Norway's sovereign wealth fund in May to exclude two companies linked to construction and real estate in the Palestinian territories. 
KLP, which had $70 billion worth of assets under management at the end of the first quarter, said it had sold shares in the companies worth 275 million crowns ($31.81 million) and as of June had completed the process. In Motorola and Alstom, it had also sold its bond holdings.
Selling Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) was ""a very straightforward decision"" as its video security and software was used in border surveillance.
Alstom did not reply to a request for comment. Motorola, with headquarters in Chicago, did not reply to a request for comment sent outside of U.S. office hours.
A senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) welcomed KLP's move.
""The Norwegian step is significant to stop dealing with companies that support settlements on Palestinian land. We welcome it, and we urge other countries to take similar steps,"" Wasel Abu Youssef told Reuters. 
""After the United Nations announced its blacklist of companies that operate in settlements, all countries must either suspend the work of these companies or boycott them.""
Israeli authorities condemned KLP's action.
""The decision harms Israelis and Palestinians and does not contribute to the resolution of the conflict,"" an Israeli official said.
DIVESTMENTS
Telecoms companies including Bezeq and Cellcom Israel were removed as the services they provide help make the settlements more attractive residential areas, KLP said, while banks including Leumi helped finance the infrastructure.
In a similar vein, construction and engineering groups such as Alstom and local peers Ashtrom and Electra were responsible for building the infrastructure, while Paz Oil helped power them.
The other companies to be excluded were: Bank Hapoalim, Israel Discount Bank, Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, Delek Group, Energix Renewable Energies, First International Bank of Israel and Partner Communications.
Energix Renewable Energies told Reuters that, as of today, it had no activity or investments in the West Bank. In March 2021, it agreed to sell its stake in a photovoltaic plant there, and the sale concluded in June, filings to the Tel Aviv stock exchange showed.
Bezeq, Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, Bank Hapoalim and Partner Communications declined to comment. The other companies did not reply to requests for comment. 
Telecoms company Altice, which was listed until January 2021, was also excluded.

Altice did not reply to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Upbeat eurozone business activity saw European shares reverse session losses on Monday, leaving them just about half a percent away from all-time peaks, while a nearly 12% surge in Morrisons sent London mid-caps to record highs. 
Extending gains to a third straight session, the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.3%. 
Euro zone businesses expanded activity at the fastest rate in 15 years in June as the easing of more coronavirus restrictions powered the bloc's dominant service industry, PMIs showed. 
The surge came at the cost of mounting inflationary pressures.
But ""(as) higher prices still seem to reflect temporary shortages, there is good reason to expect headline inflation to drop back sharply in 2022 as base effects are reversed and shortages ease,"" said Jessica Hinds, a Europe economist at Capital Economics. 
Banks, material stocks and travel shares led gains on the day. Trading volumes, however, were subdued with U.S. markets closed for an extended 4th of July weekend.
In London, the blue-chips index hit over two-week highs, with eyes on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due on Monday to set out plans to end social and economic COVID-19 restrictions in England.
British mid-caps, meanwhile, posted their best day in two months, up 1.2%. 
Morrisons jumped to a near eight-year high after U.S. private equity company Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) became the third suitor for the British supermarket group, saying it was considering a possible offer. Morrisons on Saturday agreed to a 6.3 billion pound ($8.7 billion) takeover with another group.
""Perhaps interested parties only made their move once they could see that UK assets were becoming more attractive to overseas investors,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
The broader STOXX 600 benchmark has struggled to reclaim an all-time high hit in mid-June as the jump in virus cases raised the spectre of new travel restrictions, while a recent spike in inflation has sparked fears of a quick tapering in monetary stimulus despite assurances to the contrary from the ECB.

After the central bank kept its policy unchanged last month, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Friday the euro zone economy was beginning to rebound from the pandemic-induced slump, but the recovery remained fragile.
France's Health Minister Olivier Veran warned the country could be heading for a fourth wave of the pandemic due to the Delta variant. French shares lost ahlf a percent before ending the day up 0.2%.

To be set up in the fourth quarter and based in Zagreb, the venture, called Bugatti-Rimac, will be 55%-owned by Rimac, with Porsche AG owning the rest.
Volkswagen will transfer Bugatti to the entity, Porsche said, adding Rimac CEO Mate Rimac will also lead the JV.
Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess already said in March that Porsche would most likely form a JV with Rimac involving Bugatti and end up owning a minority stake.
""We are combining Bugatti's strong expertise in the hypercar business with Rimac's tremendous innovative strength in the highly promising field of electric mobility,"" Porsche AG CEO and Volkswagen board member Oliver Blume said.
Under the JV's roof two hypercar models will be produced: the Bugatti Chiron and the all-electric Rimac Nevera. All Bugatti models will continue to be produced at the brand's factory in Molsheim, France, Porsche said.
Porsche AG's Blume and the unit's finance chief Lutz Meschke will become members of the supervisory board of Bugatti-Rimac, which will have a total of about 430 employees in Zagreb and Molsheim.

Porsche AG earlier this year raised its direct stake in Rimac to 24% in a deal that valued the electric hypercar maker, which is currently assessing strategic options, at 795 million euros ($943 million).

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Battle for Britain's Morrisons hots up as Apollo enters fray,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -The $8.7 billion battle for Britain's Morrisons intensified on Monday when a third private equity group entered the field sending the supermarket group's share price racing ahead of the value of an offer it recommended on Saturday.
New York-headquartered Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), which last year missed out on buying Morrisons rival Asda, said it was examining a potential offer but had not approached its board.
Private equity groups have embarked on a spending spree on assets around the world in the last six months, flush with cash after they largely sat out the pandemic. Morrisons, set up 122 years ago as a market stall in Bradford, northern England, is a target.
On Saturday, Morrisons said its board had recommended a takeover led by SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group that valued Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain at 6.3 billion pounds ($8.7 billion).
The offer from Fortress, along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments, exceeded a 5.52 billion pound proposal from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which Morrisons rejected on June 17.
While the Fortress offer was on Monday described as ""good value"" by abrdn - a number 15 investor in Morrisons according to Refinitiv data - it was less than the 6.5 billion pounds asked for last week by JO Hambro, a top 10 shareholder.
Fortress' offer gives Morrisons an enterprise value of 9.5 billion pounds when including net debt of 3.2 billion pounds. 
Its shares were up 11.4% at 267.1 pence at 1523 GMT - ahead of the 254 pence value of the Fortress deal, indicating investors expect higher offers. Morrisons had no comment on Apollo's statement.
Analysts have speculated that other private equity groups and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could also bid. Amazon has declined to comment.
While Britain has always been a key destination in Europe for private equity investments, volumes have peaked this year as Brexit and sterling weakness coupled with the coronavirus crisis hit company valuations.
Like its peers Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda, Morrisons enjoyed a surge in sales in the last 18 months, as hospitality was forced to shut, but the cost of ramping up online delivery hit profits.
KINGMAKERS
Ultimately, shareholders will decide Morrisons' fate.
As things stand there is only one firm bid on the table and investors will vote on the Fortress deal.
Morrisons' three biggest investors Silchester, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Columbia Threadneedle, which Refinitiv data showed having stakes of 15.2%, 9.6% and 9.4% respectively, are effectively the kingmakers. None has commented.
Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), another top 10 Morrisons shareholder, said investors needed more information about the value of its property so they could make a considered decision.
Under UK takeover rules Fortress' offer resets the clock for CD&R to clarify its intentions, with a previous deadline of July 17 extended.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said CD&R could pay more than the agreed offer from Fortress, pointing out that CD&R has a bigger UK retail footprint than Fortress as it owns the Motor Fuels Group petrol forecourt chain. Also CD&R might be able to bid more if sale and leasebacks of Morrisons stores form part of its plan.
Fortress has ruled out material store sales and says it likes to empower existing management teams - an approach that could prove popular with the government after the pandemic showed the importance of retaining food production locally.
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said takeover proposals were a commercial matter for the companies involved.
Morrisons owns 85% of its nearly 500 stores and has 19 mostly freehold manufacturing sites. It is unique among British supermarkets in making over half of the fresh food it sells.
British supermarkets are once again attractive because of their cash generation and freehold assets. The funds believe the stock market is not recognising the grocers' value in the wake of the pandemic.
Last year Apollo lost out on buying Asda to brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and TDR Capital. That deal valued Asda at 6.8 billion pounds.

Shares in Tesco and Sainsbury's were up 3.1% and 2.4% respectively, with speculation swirling that they could also attract approaches. Both companies declined to comment.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The Private Department of Sheikh Mohamed Bin Khalid Al Nahyan LLC (PD), a relatively small real estate player in Abu Dhabi owned by members of its ruling family, has hired banks for a debut sale of U.S. dollar-denominated sukuk, or Islamic bonds, a document showed on Monday.
The company, which owns a portfolio that is focused 90% in the United Arab Emirates capital with the rest in neighbouring Dubai, hired Emirates NBD Capital and First Abu Dhabi Bank as global coordinators.
Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank and Mashreq will join them in arranging investor calls starting on Monday, the document from one of the banks showed.
A five-year sukuk sale will follow, subject to market conditions. Proceeds will fund capital expenditure and acquisitions, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said in a report.
The agency has assigned PD a sub-investment grade 'BB' long-term issuer rating, constrained by its ""limited portfolio size in a fragmented and weak Abu Dhabi real estate market and its high leverage,"" but ""supported by good asset quality, locational advantage, and strong shareholders.""
The bond sale would largely refinance existing loans, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, one of them adding it was likely to be around $500 million.
The Gulf rarely sees private companies tap the international debt markets, and one of the sources said the deal would pave the way for new issuers.
""They will come back to the market. This is the first transaction,"" the source said, adding the goal was to follow this debut five-year deal with medium- to long-term funding in the future.
""Enough of the same,"" the source said, referring to a region where sovereigns made up roughly half the volume of issuance in the past two years, though they are expected to represent a smaller slice of the market this year.
The company said in an investor presentation reviewed by Reuters that its ""strong relationship with the Abu Dhabi government"" gave it priority assistance in receiving re-zoning and planning approvals, as well as demonstrated support and financial and in-kind contributions, as well as other benefits.
PD's properties in development are expected to result in revenue growth of between 4% and 5% this year and 25% to 30% in 2022. Its portfolio ""will remain small in a regional context"" despite the additions and potential acquisitions, S&P said.
The properties market in the United Arab Emirates - a significant component of the country's gross domestic product - suffered last year amid the coronavirus crisis, with prices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai falling sharply. 
""The Abu Dhabi real estate market is at a low point in the cycle, which could dampen the company's growth,"" S&P said.
The company's total debt was 2.17 billion dirhams ($590.86 million) at end-2020, the investor presentation showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is in talks with mRNA vaccine makers including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to produce COVID-19 shots in the country and is ready to offer the capacity to make up to 1 billion doses immediately, a senior government official said.
The plan, if agreed, would help ease tight global supply of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in Asia which lags North America and Europe in vaccine rollouts, and put South Korea a step closer to its ambition to become a major vaccine manufacturing centre.
South Korea already has deals to locally produce three coronavirus vaccines developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford University,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), and Russia. It also has a vaccine bottling and packaging deal with Moderna.
""We've been holding frequent talks with big pharmaceutical companies to produce mRNA vaccines,"" Lee Kang-ho, director general for the global vaccine hub committee under South Korea's health ministry, told Reuters in an interview.
""There are only a few mRNA vaccine developers - Pfizer, Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech. Thus there's a limit to how much they can produce to meet global demand... South Korea is keen to help by offering its facilities and skilled human resources,"" Lee said.
It's not immediately clear how advanced these talks are and whether and when a deal will be agreed.
BioNTech declined to comment, Moderna and CureVac did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments.
A Pfizer spokesperson said the company is making efforts to enhance its COVID-19 vaccine supply chain but added ""we do not have anything specific to announce at this time.""
Lee declined to name local vaccine makers which have the capacity to produce mRNA vaccines immediately, but a government source said they include Hanmi Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd and Quratis Co Ltd.
Hanmi confirmed that it has a big capacity reserved for  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s diabetes drug and it can be used for COVID-19 vaccine production as the Sanofi project has stalled.
""We happen to have this facility available right now because our clinical trial (with Sanofi) was discontinued in the middle of last year,"" Kim Soo-jin, senior vice president of Hanmi, told Reuters. 
""It’s very timely that we have a fully ready, GMP, state-of-the-art facility available,"" she said, referring to good manufacturing practice.
Quratis, which makes a tuberculosis vaccine, said its new factory built last year can now be used for mRNA vaccine production.
Shares in Hanmi erased early losses and rose nearly 7% on Monday after the Reuters report, and its top shareholder Hanmi Science jumped 10.3%.
COLLABORATION WITH WHO
South Korea has stepped up its effort to produce more vaccines since U.S. President Joe Biden in May agreed with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on a comprehensive partnership on COVID-19 vaccines.
Lee said his team is having frequent video conference calls with the vaccine makers and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters the organisation is ""talking with South Korea and other countries,"" but did not elaborate.
The WHO said last month it will set up a hub in South Africa to manufacture mRNA vaccines within 9-12 months that will give companies from poor and middle-income countries the know-how and licenses to produce COVID-19 vaccines. 
Lee said mRNA vaccine makers may be reluctant to share their technology, but they can take advantage of South Korea's raw material suppliers to address a global shortage of such ingredients as lipids, nucleotides and capping reagents.
""They're capable of manufacturing and developing such raw materials to help vaccine makers... and the South Korean government is committed to provide all necessary support including financial and administrative aid.""

Lee said the country also has a capacity for at least another 500 million doses of fill-and-finish vaccines apart from the deal Moderna announced with Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics in May.
South Korea has deals to buy 106 million doses of mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna to cover full vaccination of its population of 52 million this year. The government said last week it would purchase more mRNA shots to use them as a booster shot next year.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday it expanded its design studio in China, which will focus only on developing electric and connected cars and no longer design petrol vehicles.
The move comes as the largest U.S. automaker prepares to cut out petrol and diesel vehicles from its fleet by 2035 and underscores its efforts to gain a bigger foothold in China, the world's largest electric car market. 
It also plays into GM's ambitions of adding a recurring revenue stream from software and services long after the initial product is sold, a la Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), by selling EV battery charging and swapping services for example.
GM has said it wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million electric vehicles (EV) in the United States and China by 2025. Last month, the company said it would boost spending on electric and autonomous vehicles, shelling out $35 billion through 2025, up 75% from March 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic choked the industry.
With new facilities and the studio's growing team of employees, ""we have the right organizations and people to bring the most desirable products to China's consumers,"" Julian Blissett, executive vice president and president of GM China said in a statement.
The new advanced design studio - one of three around the world that designs future generation GM vehicles - was built by redesigning the existing studio on the same campus as GM's China tech centre in Shanghai. 
GM said it nearly doubled the studio to 5,000 square metres, and is hiring to expand the design team. The company did not say how many employees will be added. 

A person close to the automaker said the team currently has fewer than 40 designers, digital and physical modelers, virtual reality experts, and support personnel.
GM, which sells cars in China through its two joint ventures with state-owned SAIC Motor Corp, sold 170,000 all-electric vehicles in China last year, up from 50,000 in 2019.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",German car production forecast slashed as supply-chain woes persist,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's car industry on Monday slashed its forecast for production growth this year, indicating that the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will be bumpy as manufacturers battle supply-chain disruptions.
The Association of German Automobile Manufacturers (VDA) cut its forecast for production growth to 3% from 13% previously, saying that production in recent months had been ""significantly below expectations"".
It now expects 3.6 million cars to be made in Germany this year, down by 400,000 units from its last forecast, the VDA said in its mid-year market update.
The German car industry - featuring powerful brands like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) , Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW - accounts for an estimated 5% of the economic output and more than 800,000 jobs, making it a bellwether for Europe's largest economy.
Manufacturers idled production early in the pandemic in anticipation of a go-slow by car buyers, and have been caught short by a snapback in demand as economies have reopened this year.

German car production, at 1.73 million units, was up 16% in year-on-year terms in the first half of 2021. But, in an indication of the difficulties, output was down 19% in the month of June, the VDA figures showed.
New car registrations rose in Germany in the first half of the year by 15% to 1.39 million units.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc said a regulatory order that its app be removed from app stores in China could hurt revenue, while other newly U.S.-listed Chinese firms also found themselves the subject of cybersecurity investigations.
Sunday's takedown order from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) comes just two days after the regulator announced an investigation into Didi and less than a week after it made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.
Didi told Reuters on Monday that it was unaware before the initial public offering (IPO) that the CAC would launch a cybersecurity investigation or order a halt in China to new user registrations and a suspension of app downloads.
The CAC's move also comes amid a widespread regulatory squeeze on Chinese tech firms that began with the scuttling of a $37 billion listing planned by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fintech affiliate Ant Group late last year.
""Both the Ant IPO cancellation and this action on Didi show that IPOs can be very dangerous in China, shedding light on one's scale and operations that invite regulatory scrutiny,"" said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
Much of China's regulatory blitz has been by its antitrust watchdog and the order against Didi represents one of the CAC's most high-profile actions since its 2014 founding, suggesting a growing emphasis on data security for firms listing in the United States.
On Monday, the CAC also announced cybersecurity investigations into online recruiting company Zhipin.com and truck-hailing companies Huochebang and Yunmanman, which have merged to form Full Truck Alliance. Like Didi, Zhipin.com's owner Kanzhun Ltd and Full Truck Alliance went public in U.S. listings last month. 
Full Truck Alliance said it would suspend new user registrations as required by the investigation and will cooperate with the probe. Kanzhun did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""For a government that is keen to showcase its homegrown champions, one would think that China would want to deal with these issues in a timely and private manner,"" said Zennon Kapron, head of research and consultant group Kapronasia, referring to the Didi and Ant investigations.
""The fact that this isn't happening is a clear indication that China is looking to use these companies as a warning to other tech firms,"" Kapron said. 
DIDI'S DOLDRUMS
Didi, which has a current market value of some $75 billion, is also the subject of an antitrust probe by China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, sources told Reuters last month.
The CAC said it had ordered app stores to stop offering Didi's app after finding that the company had illegally collected users' personal data.
""The Company expects that the app takedown may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,"" Didi said in a statement but did not elaborate on the potential extent of the impact.
Analysts have said they do not expect a major hit to earnings as Didi's existing user base in China is large. The removal of the app does not affect existing users.
Didi reported first-quarter revenue of about 42.2 billion yuan ($6.5 billion), more than 90% of which comes from its China mobility division. In addition to its dominant position in China's ride-hailing market, it operates in 15 other countries.
Didi, which collects a vast amount of mobility data for technology research and traffic analysis, also said it will strive to rectify any problems and will protect users' privacy and data security.
The Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, said on Monday that Didi's apparent ""big data analysis"" capability could pose risks to users' personal information.
""No internet giant can be allowed to become a super database of Chinese people's personal information that contains more details than the country, and these companies cannot be allowed to use the data however they want,"" it said in an opinion piece.
In its IPO prospectus, Didi said: ""we follow strict procedures in collecting, transmitting, storing and using user data pursuant to our data security and privacy policies.""
Major Chinese tech firms, including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and Meituan, saw their Hong Kong-listed shares slump, affected both by the action against Didi and the unveiling of new rules by the country's competition watchdog on Friday to combat illegal pricing activities.

SoftBank Group Corp, whose Vision Fund unit holds stakes in both Didi and Full Truck Alliance, saw its shares fall 5% in Tokyo on Monday.

Charging infrastructure expansion has been a central hurdle to the mass adoption of battery-powered vehicles, with the lack of expansion fuelling so-called range anxiety, the fear of not having enough charging spots to make the trip.
""The key ingredient in the future rolling-out of electric vehicles will be the infrastructure. It will be the big bottleneck,"" Martin Daum, chief executive of Daimler Trucks, to be spun off from Daimler later this year, told Reuters.
The three companies, which are all building electric trucks and are normally competitors, will jointly invest 500 million euros ($593 million) in the venture that they will own equally and that will start operations in 2022.
""And thereafter we are very open in all directions to let other parties partner with us and actually bring equity into the joint venture,"" Traton CEO Matthias Gruendler said, adding he expected a lot of outside interest once the JV has been set up.
The aim is to install and operate at least 1,700 charging points within five years. The joint company will be based in Amsterdam and will over time seek further partners and public funding.
European car industry association ACEA has called for up to 50,000 high-performance charging points by 2030. Gruendler said that roughly 10 billion euros would be needed to build out Europe's infrastructure to be fully electrified by 2050.

""In order to accelerate further, we need additional partners, additional networks and public funds,"" AB Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt said. ""We will continue to be very fierce competitors. But we need a new platform to compete upon.""

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>",Britain proposes tech company listing reforms to catch up with New York,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's financial watchdog on Monday proposed making it easier for tech companies to list in London to strengthen the capital's ability to compete with New York and the European Union following Brexit.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed allowing dual class share structures for ""innovative, often founder-led companies"" for the first five years of a listing on the London Stock Exchange's premium segment.
Dual class share structures allow company founders to maintain control at the expense of ordinary shareholders and are popular in New York and Amsterdam, the EU's top share-trading centre.
They are already available in London on the standard segment, but shareholder rights groups who back ""one share, one vote"" oppose their introduction on London's premium segment where top companies list.
""We have therefore made clear in our proposal that we will not allow artificial means of prolonging the 5 year period,"" the FCA said.
The FCA also proposed cutting the amount of shares that must be made available to the public or free-float to 10% from 25%.
The minimum market capitalisation, however, for both the premium and standard segments for ordinary commercial companies would be raised to 50 million pounds ($69 million) from 700,000 pounds.
Cutting the free-float while raising minimum capitalisation would put London in line with exchanges in New York and elsewhere.
Capital raised globally through flotations grew 42% last year from 2019, with much of the increase coming from the United States and China while Britain's share of global IPOs has been falling rapidly in recent years, the FCA said.
""Today, we are acting assertively to meet the needs of an evolving marketplace,"" said Clare Cole, the FCA's director of market oversight.
""Our proposals should result in a wider range of listings in the UK, and increased choice for investors while we continue to ensure appropriate levels of investor protection.""
The LSE said the proposals were crucial to ensuring that Britain remains one of the world's leading financial centres.
The proposals stem from a government-backed review of listing rules by former European Commissioner Jonathan Hill, who said it was good to see momentum building to improve London's attractiveness as a place to list.
A public consultation on the proposals will close in September, with final rules due before the end of 2021.

The FCA is also due to announce final rules for easing listings of SPACs or special purpose acquisition companies to catch up with a flurry of listings in New York and Amsterdam.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Monday got a new chief executive: Andy Jassy, the mastermind behind its lucrative cloud computing division, who succeeds company founder Jeff Bezos.
Here's a look at the business Jassy is taking over and the challenges that await him on the job.
MORE THAN THE 'EVERYTHING STORE'
* Bezos incorporated Amazon exactly 27 years ago. The internet bookseller he founded out of a garage has morphed into a purveyor of virtually any consumer good, online and in physical stores. It has grown far beyond even that: Jassy built an enormously profitable and market-leading business, Amazon Web Services, that runs data centers serving a wide range of corporate computing needs. Amazon is also expanding further afield into Hollywood and healthcare. 
* Amazon's stock started out at $1.50 per share, when adjusting for future equity splits. It now trades at more than $3,500 per share and is worth over $1.7 trillion total, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
* Amazon's annual profit almost doubled in 2020 to $21.3 billion. That's partly because the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged more consumers to shop online, helping the company grow revenue 38% to $386.1 billion.
REGULATORY PUSHBACK
* With size has come greater scrutiny. Long chased by global regulators on issues such as taxation and data collection, Amazon now is fending off antitrust complaints that could lead to big fines.
* U.S. President Joe Biden recently appointed a prominent tech critic, Lina Khan, to run the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Amazon. Though the details of the probe aren't public, it is expected to involve Amazon's conflict of interest as a retailer of its own products that compete with third-party merchants on its platform. Amazon has been accused of using the proprietary data of third-party vendors to make cheaper, private-label versions of their products. Amazon contests these claims.
* Meanwhile, Congress is considering new antitrust laws that could alter Amazon's business. And European regulators have been investigating a number of the company's practices.
CHALLENGES CLOSER TO HOME
* Amazon also faces challenges from some of the biggest U.S. companies. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, for instance, is chasing after Amazon's home turf with a package delivery club of its own, while  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has signed deals in the cloud with top enterprises - Walmart included - to narrow the lead of Jassy's AWS. 

* Jassy also faces potential disruption from within. Amazon is grappling with unionization interest among warehouse employees and potentially other workers. Although it handily beat back an organizing effort at its Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment center, labor groups including the Teamsters vow that the fight is only beginning.
* The company likewise is hoping to maintain its allure among office staff, as some startups offer tech jobs with more flexible work schedules. The company initially said it planned an ""office-centric culture,"" but it soon updated guidance to requiring in-person work three days a week, in line with industry peers.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>","Ask us first before swapping Libor with 'risk-laden' rate, says UK watchdog","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should ask the Financial Conduct Authority before using ""credit sensitive rates"" for replacing Libor, the tarnished benchmark which is being scrapped in December, the watchdog said on Monday.
The London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor is being ditched after banks were fined for trying to manipulate the rate for pricing mortgages, loans and derivatives worth trillions of dollars across several currencies globally.
Most contracts are being switched to ""risk-free"" overnight rates compiled by central banks, such as Sofr from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Sonia at the Bank of England.
But some market participants, particularly in the United States, plan to use ""credit sensitive"" rates based on transactions in commercial paper and certificate of deposit markets.
""We ask that any regulated UK market participants looking to use these so-called 'credit sensitive' rates in UK-based business consider the risks carefully, and raise with their FCA supervisors before doing so,"" Edwin Schooling Latter, the FCA's director of markets and wholesale policy, told a UK Finance event on Monday.
Liquidity in markets underpinning credit sensitive rates dried up and yields spiked during market turmoil in March 2020 when economies went into pandemic lockdowns, he said.
""So these rates may look relatively benign in 'normal' market conditions. But there can be a painful sting in the tail for borrowers at times of stress,"" Schooling Latter said.
""The good news is that the bulk of outstanding dollar swap market positions are going to be moving to Sofr, not these risk-laden alternatives.""

While new products are referencing Sonia in Britain, there was still work to do in switching outstanding contracts and Schooling Latter urged markets to complete this by the end of the third quarter.
""It will help avoid risks of getting caught in a pre-Christmas rush – where we could see a squeeze in IT, legal or other resources, or would simply have too little time to adjust to unexpected hurdles,"" he said.

Between January and May, Airbus handed over a total of 220 airplanes, up 38% compared with the same period of 2020 which was heavily affected by coronavirus lockdowns from late March.

June's performance puts the first-half total comfortably above 290 and marks one of the strongest monthly totals since the start of the pandemic, behind a peak of 89 in December 2020, the sources said.

The brand ""Cathay"" will allow users to purchase services and goods through the airline only in Hong Kong at first, which will be expanded globally later, the company said, adding that a credit card in conjunction would be launched soon. 

Cathay's move comes after low-budget carrier AirAsia in March announced plans to launch air taxi and drone delivery services, while Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) branched out into the restaurant business last year.
The Hong Kong flag carrier has been hit hard by the pandemic like its industry peers, with Cathay operating at just 8% of its usual passenger capacity as it forecast ""substantial"" losses for a third consecutive half.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - One97 Communications Ltd, the parent of Indian payments firm Paytm, will file a draft prospectus as early as July 12 for a domestic initial public offering (IPO) that seeks to raise $2.3 billion, two sources close to the matter said on Monday.
The money will be raised via sale of new Paytm stock as well as a secondary offering of shares at an expected valuation of $24 billion to $25 billion with an option to raise the amount at a later stage if required, the sources said, declining to be named as the matter is not public.
Paytm's proposed $2.3 billion IPO will make it India's third-biggest public listing in dollar terms after state-run miner Coal India in 2010 and Reliance Power in 2008. 
The prospectus will be filed shortly after Paytm's extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders in Delhi on July 12, possibly on the same day, the sources added.
Paytm declined to comment.
Paytm, which counts China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Japan's SoftBank as backers, is seeking shareholder approval at the EGM to sell up to 120 billion rupees ($1.61 billion) in new stock and have an option to retain an over-subscription of up to 1%, Reuters reported previously.
There were $3.6 billion worth of IPOs in India in the first half of 2021, up from $1.1 billion at the same time last year, according to Refinitiv. 
The level so far this year is the highest since 2008, the data showed. Sona BLW Precision Forgings raised $757.4 million in its June IPO which was the biggest listing in India this year.
Paytm has hired JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), ICICI Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS), Citi and HDFC Bank for the IPO, the sources said.

Citi and ICICI Securities declined to comment. Other banks did not respond to requests for comment.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>","Exclusive: After pressuring telecom firms, Myanmar's junta bans executives from leaving","By Fanny Potkin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Senior foreign executives of major telecommunications firms in Myanmar have been told by the junta that they must not leave the country without permission, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
A confidential order from Myanmar’s Posts and Telecommunications Department (PTD) in mid-June said senior executives, both foreigners and Myanmar nationals, must seek special authorisation to leave the country, the person said. 
A week later, telecom companies were sent a second letter telling them they had until Monday July 5 to fully implement intercept technology they had previously been asked to install to let authorities spy on calls, messages and web traffic and to track users by themselves, the source said. Reuters has not seen the orders. 
The directives follow pressure on the companies from the junta, which is facing daily protests from its opponents and a growing number of insurgencies to activate the spyware technology. 
A spokesman for the military did not answer multiple requests for comment. The junta has never commented on the electronic surveillance effort, but announced soon after seizing power its aim to pass a cybersecurity bill that would require telecoms providers to provide data when requested and remove or block any content deemed to be disrupting ""unity, stabilisation, and peace"". It also amended privacy laws to free security forces to intercept communications. 
The travel ban comes after intensified pressure from military officials to finish the implementation of the surveillance equipment. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the ban was meant to pressure telecoms firms to finish activating the spyware technology, although the order itself does not specify a reason.
Three other telecoms sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the authorities had stepped up pressure on the companies to implement the intercept, but declined to elaborate further. Two sources said companies had been warned repeatedly by junta officials not to speak publicly or to the media on the intercept.
Telenor declined to comment. There was no immediate response to requests for comment from Ooredoo, state-owned MPT and Mytel, a joint venture between Vietnam's Viettel and a Myanmar military-owned conglomerate.
Months before the Feb. 1 coup, telecom and internet service providers were ordered to install intercept spyware to allow the army to eavesdrop on the communications of citizens, Reuters reported in May.
Reuters was not able to establish how broadly the surveillance technology has been installed and deployed, but four sources said Norway's  Telenor ASA  (OTC:TELNY) and Qatar's Ooredoo QPSC had yet to comply in full.

Among the military's first actions on Feb. 1 was to cut internet access and it has still not been fully re-established, with telecoms given regular lists of websites and activist phone numbers to block. 
The moves have left the future unclear for Myanmar's telecom sector, which had been one of the fastest-growing globally. Telenor said on Friday it is evaluating the future of its operations in the country, with a source telling Reuters it is eying a sale of its Myanmar unit.

(Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is set to formally block Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's plan to merge the country's top two videogame streaming sites, Huya (NYSE:HUYA) and DouYu, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Tencent has failed to come up with sufficient remedies to meet the State Administration of Market Regulation's (SAMR) requirements on giving up exclusive rights, said two of the people.
The internet giant recently withdrew the merger application for antitrust review and refiled it after SAMR told the company it could not complete the review of the merger within 180 days since its first filing, one of them and a separate person said.
The people declined to be named as the information is private.
Tencent - China's No. 1 videogame and social media company - Huya, DouYu and the SAMR did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Separately, Tencent's plan to take private search engine Sogou (NYSE:SOGO) will be approved this month by SAMR, one of the people said. Reuters reported in April the regulator was ready to clear the plan.
Tencent first announced plans to merge Huya and DouYu last year in a tie-up designed to streamline its stakes in the firms, which were estimated by data firm MobTech to have an 80% slice of a market worth more than $3 billion and growing fast.
Huya and DouYu are ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, as China's most popular video game streaming sites, where users flock to watch e-sports tournaments and follow professional gamers. 

Tencent is Huya's biggest shareholder with 36.9% and also owns over a third of DouYu, with both firms listed in the United States, and worth a combined $6 billion in market value.
Reuters reported in March, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that Tencent was having to offer concessions in a plan to merge Huya and DouYu in order to resolve antitrust concerns.

Vitasoy said in a statement on social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) on Saturday that a staff member had circulated an internal memo that was widely shared online, describing it as ""extremely inappropriate"" and without authorisation. It added that the company reserved the right to take legal action.
The employee's memo offered condolences to the family of a 50-year-old Vitasoy worker who had stabbed a police officer, 28, and then killed himself on Thursday, the anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule.
Police and security officials have described the stabbing as a terrorist attack by a lone wolf, saying a computer they seized from his home showed he had been ""radicalised."" Police did not provide further details about his alleged radicalisation.
The officer's condition has improved to serious from critical.
The memo triggered a flood of online calls for a boycott of the company, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from mainland China.

Mainland actors Gong Jun and Ren Jialun, who have worked with Vitasoy, plan to end ties with the company, according to the Global Times tabloid.
Hong Kong authorities warned on Sunday that advocating for people to mourn for the attacker was no different from ""supporting terrorism"" and criticised parents who took children to mourn him.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, with investors keeping a wary eye on the oil market, while the prospect of a bidding war for Wm Morrison (LON:MRW) sparked interest across the U.K. grocery sector.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
The market is cautiously waiting for news from Vienna with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, set to reconvene talks aimed at finalizing output levels for the rest of the year and beyond.
The group had appeared on Friday to have come to an agreement, before the United Arab Emirates’ last-minute refusal cast doubt on the group's ability to keep its discipline in the face of rising prices.
At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $75.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $76.27, after posting last week its first down week in six.
In corporate news, Morrisons stock soared over 11% after private equity group, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), also expressed interest in bidding for Britain’s fourth largest grocery chain. 
Over the weekend Morrisons agreed to a takeover led by SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group that valued the firm at 6.3 billion pounds ($8.7 billion). Previously, U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice had had a lower bid rejected.
Fellow supermarkets rose in conjunction, with  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) stock up 1% and J  Sainsbury  (LON:SBRY) stock up 1.4%, while retail giant Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS), which has a large food section, rose 2%. Talks of the U.K. fully reopening on July 19 as scheduled will have also helped, dragging fast food outlet  Greggs  (LON:GRG) stock to an all-time high.  
Additionally, cybersecurity stocks rose, with  Darktrace  (LON:DARK) stock up 2.7% and Avast (LON:AVST) stock up 0.4%, after reports of another massive ransomware attack involving hundreds of companies, carried out by an organization with links to Russia.
Also of note, Chinese regulators ordered app stores to stop offering Didi Global's (NYSE:DIDI) services, just days after its listing in New York, accusing the ride-hailing giant of illegally collecting users’ data. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), a major backer of Didi, fell 5% in Tokyo overnight.
Caixin Services PMIEarlier Monday, data showed China’s services sector grew in June at its slowest pace in 14 months. Adding to Thursday’s manufacturing equivalent figure also falling in June, this suggested that the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy from the Covid-19 pandemic is starting to abate. By contrast, IHS Markit's final PMI for the Eurozone in June was revised up to a new record high of 59.5.
The pandemic continues to cast shadows over the region, however. French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned over the weekend that a wave of Covid infections may hit his country by the end of July because of the delta variant. His country’s industrial production fell 0.3% on the month in May.
That said, any losses are likely to be limited with U.S. markets closed for the extended July 4 weekend.

U.S.-based Madhavpeddi joined the board of the London-listed miner in February 2020 and is better known as the chief executive of China Molybdenum International (CMOC), a role he covered for almost ten years until 2018. 
During his time at the Chinese producer, Madhavpeddi made a series of sizable acquisitions, including U.S. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc.'s majority stake in the Tenke copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo for $2.65 billion and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL)'s niobium and phosphates business in Brazil.
""I am delighted to have been appointed Chairman at such an exciting time for the business,"" Madhavpeddi said in a statement. 
""As the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy and mobility, our portfolio of commodities will allow Glencore to play a key role in helping us achieve the goals of Paris and play a key role in the ongoing energy and mobility transition."" 

Miners are under pressure from investors and policymakers to cut out carbon emissions and tackle climate change.
Glencore has this month completed a management reshuffle with the appointment of new chief Gary Nagle, a shift to a younger leadership for the mining company.

JD, Britain's biggest sportswear retailer, bought DTLR in February for $495 million. DTLR sells mostly athletic footwear and apparel streetwear and the deal followed the purchase of Shoe Palace in December.
""It was always JD's intention for DTLR to be part of the Genesis sub-group but the requirement for speed and certainty of execution ... meant that it was more appropriate for the Group to initially acquire DTLR directly,"" JD said, referring to its U.S. unit, Genesis Topco.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally lower Monday, with investors keeping a wary eye on the oil market following signs that China’s economic recovery may be slowing. 
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%. 
Earlier Monday, a private survey showed China’s services sector grew in June at its slowest pace in 14 months, with the Caixin services purchasing managers index coming in at 50.3, the lowest since April 2020. 
This, following on from Thursday’s manufacturing equivalent figure also falling in June, suggested that the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy from the  Covid-19 pandemic is starting to abate.
Elsewhere, the market will be waiting for news from Vienna with a group of major oil producers set to reconvene talks aimed at finalizing output levels for the rest of the year and beyond.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, had appeared on Friday to have decided to increase production by about 2 million barrels a day from August to December 2021, as well as extend the remaining output cuts to the end of 2022.
However, this show of unity was dashed by the United Arab Emirates’s last-minute refusal to agree to the deal, prompting Monday’s fresh negotiations.  
At 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $75.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $76.23, after posting last week its first down week in six.
Adding to the reasons to be cautious, French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned over the weekend that a wave of Covid infections may hit his country by the end of July because of the delta variant. Across the Channel, however, signs increased that the government is set to lift remaining Covid-19 restrictions on July 19, as planned.
Any losses are likely to be limited with U.S. markets closed for the extended July 4 weekend. Additionally, Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release was received positively as it indicated the American economic recovery remained intact but wouldn’t yet prompt the Federal Reserve to withdraw its stimulus. 
However, some think that picture might change over the next couple of months, as the ending of enhanced unemployment benefits squeezes people back into the labor force.
""For the third month in a row, the June nonfarm payroll report understated the strength in the labor market, which we think we will see emerge in July,"" said Phil Orlando,. chief equity strategist at asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), in a note to clients.  Orlando expects payrolls growth to accelerate to 1.5 million this month, with another ""blowout"" month in August following.
Nearer term, investors will also be monitoring the release of final purchasing managers’ index readings out of the Eurozone for an indication as to the health of the economic recovery across the continent.
Europe’s tech sector is likely to be in focus Monday following the news that Chinese regulators ordered app stores to stop offering Didi Global's (NYSE:DIDI) services, just days after its listing in New York, accusing the ride-hailing giant of illegally collecting users’ data. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), a major backer of Didi, fell 5% in Tokyo overnight.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,785.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1854.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2021 10:40PM ET</span>","Toshiba needs 'prompt, appropriate' disclosure, TSE chief says","By Makiko Yamazaki, Hideyuki Sano and Noriyuki Hirata
TOKYO (Reuters) -The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) wants Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp to make ""prompt and appropriate"" disclosure about its widening governance scandal, including who was responsible, the head of the bourse said, adding transparency remained a problem.
Hiromi Yamaji also told Reuters that activist investors - who have been in focus because of Toshiba - can be a force for better shareholder engagement at Japanese companies and help improve governance.
His comments reflect both a shift in attitude toward activist investors in Japan, and the extent the Toshiba scandal has raised concern within corporate Japan about governance, something shareholders have said is long overdue.
""The lack of transparency is the biggest problem at Toshiba,"" Yamaji said in an interview late on Friday, adding that investors are eager to know if shareholders were treated unfairly. 
""We strongly request Toshiba make prompt and appropriate disclosures of its own inquiries such as who was responsible,"" he said.
An independent probe revealed last month that Toshiba had colluded with the government to put pressure on foreign shareholders.
Overseas investors account for 65% of trading volume on the TSE, owned by Japan Exchange Group Inc (JPX).
While some activists focus on short-term profits, Japan is seeing an increasing number of those with more constructive approaches, Yamaji said. 
""The presence of such activists could be positive in a sense that they can foster dialogue between shareholders and companies, as encouraged by Japan's corporate governance code,"" the former  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) banker said.
MARKET REVAMP
Yamaji said the bourse could further tighten the criteria for companies to stay on its main board after an initial revamp in April next year. 
The change is aimed at improving companies' profitability and governance, by raising the requirements to remain on the bourse's first section, which will be renamed the ""prime market"".
Companies will be required to have a free-floating market capitalisation of more than 10 billion yen ($90 million), and at least 35% of their total shares free-floating. They will also need to adopt a more stringent governance code in areas such as disclosure and board diversity.
He declined to say how many companies would be downgraded. Analysts expect about 30% of the nearly 2,200 listed companies could be forced from the first section.
Many investors think the exchange could set higher standards, a point Yamaji acknowledges.
""We don't think (the current criteria) is our final goal,"" he said. ""The corporate governance code will be reviewed every three years. So that might be a good time to re-evaluate our criteria too.""
He also expects more Asian companies to list in Tokyo after the debut this year of Appier, an AI technology firm founded in Taiwan, and Omni Plus System, a Singapore plastics manufacturer.

Japan's political stability, predictable regulatory environment and vast household savings make Tokyo an attractive place for fundraising for Asian firms, he said, adding the bourse was doing more marketing in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore.
""More Asian companies are starting to think of Japanese markets as an option for IPO,"" he said.

The Cyberspace Administration of China also ordered app stores to remove ride-hailing giant Didi (NYSE:DIDI) from their offerings, merely days after Didi’s listing in New York. Investors will also pay attention to any jitters as the Chinese stock market opened for trading.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.03%.

The ASX 200 edged up 0.15% in Australia, with the services PMI at a slightly higher-than-forecast 56.8. Australian retail sales, meanwhile, grew a better-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month in May.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is also due to hand down its policy decision on Tuesday.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.46%.
U.S. markets are closed for a holiday, but the S&P 500 hit a record for a seventh day on Friday after the latest U.S. jobs report hinted that the U.S. economy was continuing its recovery from COVID-19, but not quickly enough for the Fed to start asset tapering.
The report said that non-farm payrolls grew increased by a higher-than-expected 850,000 in June, while the unemployment rate was also higher than expected at 5.9%.
Although the data calmed fears that the Fed would act on the hawkish stance that it took as it handed down its latest policy decision in June, central banks globally are already starting to withdraw the unprecedented stimulus unleashed to counter the economic impact of COVID-19.
RBA is expected to pare back some stimulus in its decision, even as some cities remain under lockdown due to the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",Syngenta looks to China's farmers for growth ahead of mega-IPO,"By Dominique Patton
WEI COUNTY, China (Reuters) - Agrichemicals giant Syngenta Group is rapidly expanding its rollout of farm services in China ahead of a huge stock market listing, as it seeks to meet surging demand from farmers crucial to Beijing's increasing focus on food security.
The world's biggest crop-protection maker and No. 3 seed supplier says it is boosting grain yields and raising farmers' incomes just as the pandemic fuels government worries about food supplies and pushes up the cost of key farm materials.
That means opportunity for Swiss-based, Chinese-backed Syngenta to grab market share in a fragmented farm chemicals market, positioning the company for growth as Chinese farmers expand their holdings.
The group aims to raise $10 billion by listing in Shanghai in what is likely to be the year's biggest market flotation.
But Syngenta acknowledges it ""faces tremendous competition in the markets in which it operates."" Rivals include  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc, as well Chinese firms selling agronomy services to the nation's farmers.
""Before, we sold pesticides, seeds and fertiliser. Now we're a farm services company - we sell service and technology,"" said Mao Feng, chief brand manager for Syngenta Group China's Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) and digital agriculture. MAP is to receive some 12% of the IPO proceeds for expansion, according to a prospectus filed on Friday.
""Selling individual products, we had hit the ceiling, there was no more room,"" Mao told reporters last month.
In China, crop yields lag far behind Western countries, even as growers use three times as much fertiliser, while farms in the vast country are tiny by global standards, averaging half a hectare, compared with 180 hectares (440 acres) in the United States.
BIGGER, BETTER
So Syngenta is trying to help itself by helping farmers like Liu Ligang.
Liu, who farms 20 hectares (50 acres) in Wei county in the northern province of Hebei, has doubled his contracted land over the past four years, one of a growing number of Chinese farmers seeking to become professional growers. To date, 37 million hectares have been contracted out, some 30% of China's arable land.
Such expansion brings more risk for farmers, requiring more knowledge and sophisticated services.
Liu has just harvested some 7,500 kg of wheat per hectare (6,600 pounds per acre), up 25% from last year and 10% above his neighbours, he says, thanks to Syngenta's MAP service, which helped him manage pests.
""Before, it was only when the disease came that the pesticide was started,"" he said. ""That is too late, and it can be advanced now.""
In addition to supplying seeds and chemicals, MAP runs training centres across China and about 900 demonstration farms showing growers what produces the best yields in a given location. Farmers get free management of their land, and in return buy the firm's products or others recommended by its agronomists.
MAP tripled its revenues to more than $280 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, adding 40 centres to reach 365 nationwide. It contributed 4% of group revenues, up from 1% in the same period a year earlier.
The business also makes money selling crops and fresh produce to such customers as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Hema supermarkets and Dole Food Co. They pay above-market prices for MAP farmers' quality and the traceability of its digital platform.
Revenues are expected to break $1 billion this year and hit some $4.5 billion by 2025, according to one industry estimate.
COMPETITION
But other companies are also trying to capitalise on the increasing scale and sophistication of Chinese farming. Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), for example, is advertising for a China head of ""digital agriculture"".
Beijing-based ICAN has built digital crop models to guide farmers through plot selection, planning and harvesting. It claims its modelling can increase yields while reducing fertiliser use.
Sales of fertiliser and crop chemicals in China were $24 billion in 2018, Rabobank estimates, more than the $20 billion in the United States, while seed in each country was worth around $12 billion.
Input markets are more fragmented in China, offering huge room for share growth. Syngenta generated less than 5% of its sales in China before it was acquired by state-run ChemChina in 2017. It had less than 1% of the seed market, though a more significant 7% share of crop chemicals.
MAP is aided in reaching farmers through group affiliate Sinofert Holdings, China's largest fertiliser producer and distributor. Its 30,000 retail stores reach farmers working 95% of the country's farmland, reckons Fitch.
But China's small farm sizes push up logistics costs, and progress in consolidating land has been slower than expected, said Thomas Luedi, senior partner at Bain & Co in Shanghai.
""We found that to break even we needed to have 5,000 hectares of farmland in one town using our service,"" said an industry executive who previously helmed a farm services firm.

Syngenta said scattered farming and incomplete infrastructure and supply chains hold back all services firms. But it is working with farm co-operatives and trying to standardise production across entire villages to reduce the impact of fragmented landholdings.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it had told Didi to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules, four days after Didi began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $4.4 billion in an initial public offering. 
The CAC did not specify the nature of Didi's violation in a statement on its social media feed.
Didi responded by saying it had stopped registering new users and would remove its app from app stores. It said it would make changes to comply with rules and protect users' rights.
China has been clamping down on its home-grown technology giants over antitrust and data security concerns.
Didi made its trading debut on Wednesday in an IPO that valued the company at $67.5 billion, well down from the $100 billion it had hoped for, which potential investors had resisted.
Redex Research director Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, said the CAC's move appeared ""aggressive"".
""(It) indicates the process could take a while, but they have a large installed base so near-term impact (is) likely muted for now,"" he said.
INVESTIGATION
Didi's app was still working in China for people who had already downloaded it. It offers over 20 million rides in China every day, on average.
CAC on Friday announced an investigation into Didi to protect ""national security and the public interest"", prompting a 5.3% fall in its share price to $15.53.
The stock was sold at $14 per share in the IPO - the top of the indicated range.
Didi, which offers services in China and more than 15 other markets, gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis.
Didi had flagged Chinese regulations in its IPO prospectus and said: ""We follow strict procedures in collecting, transmitting, storing and using user data pursuant to our data security and privacy policies.""

A notice on Didi's China app showed it had updated its user information and data privacy policy on June 29, the day before its trading debut. In a statement to Reuters, Didi described the move as a ""regular update"" after adding two new services on the app under its chauffeur business.
Founded by Will Cheng in 2012, the company had previously been subject to regulatory probes in China over safety and its operating licence.

Futures in London were little changed after settling near the highest since October 2018 on Friday. Negotiations ended without a deal to boost output last week after the United Arab Emirates stuck to demands for better terms for itself. The impasse puts the alliance’s market management at stake with a supply deficit set to widen as global demand rebounds from the pandemic.

Brent crude jumped more than 8% last month, capping a powerful first-half rally, aided by a steady demand recovery in key economies including the U.S., Europe and China. That advance was also underpinned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies keeping a tight rein over supplies. Elevated energy prices are stoking concern about inflation, and the White House is already voicing concern about rising gasoline prices.
See also: High-Stakes Oil Diplomacy Puts Future of OPEC+ Deal at Risk
Most OPEC+ members backed a proposal to increase output by 400,000 barrels a day each month from August, and push back the expiry of the broader supply deal into late 2022. The UAE, however, is seeking to change the baseline that’s used to calculate its quota, a move that could allow it to boost daily production an extra 700,000 barrels. It’s also refusing to back an extension of the pact.
A failure by the cartel to agree to raise production may further squeeze the market, while a breakdown in their unity could result in a free-for-all that crashes prices -- just as it did during a price war between the allies last year.

With the UAE steadfast in its refusal to give ground, the prospect of a no-deal outcome as well as its exit from OPEC “has risen materially even if it has not yet fully entered into firm base-case territory,” RBC Capital Markets analysts including Chief Commodities Strategist Helima Croft said in a note.

""The problem was detected and sealed in a matter of minutes, and all the intruder was able to accomplish was to change a few user names,"" Miller said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
A writer for Salon posted screenshots on Twitter of several GETTR profiles, including those of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Miller himself, that were altered to read ""JubaBaghdad was here, follow me in twitter :)"".
Asked about security on the new social media said, Miller said the situation had been ""rectified."" 
Miller had teased the Trump team's plans to start a new social media platform for months following moves by Twitter and other sites to block the former president after the Jan. 6 riot where his supporters stormed the Capitol.

Trump was permanently banned from Twitter and remains suspended by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) until at least 2023 and by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube until the company determines the risk of violence has decreased.

French winegrowers jealously guard the designation ""champagne"" for the output of the region of the same name, and shun other descriptions.

AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - A shortage of qualified workers, doubts raised by working from home and supply-chain havoc are proving problematic for some companies as they try to ride France's recovery from the pandemic but struggle to fill vacancies, business leaders said. 
Less than a year before France's next presidential election, Emmanuel Macron's chances of re-election will partly hinge on the strength of a rebound beginning to benefit some of France's big industries, from luxury goods makers to energy exporters. 
At an annual economic conference in southern France, some pointed to persistent labour problems, including a shortage of qualified workers, which had now been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic as bosses try to meet resurging demand. 
The CEO of one major French manufacturer said that his company had 150 vacancies advertised at two French factories, and no resumes were coming in.
""The crisis may have anaesthetised people's relationship to work,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Rencontres Economiques conference in Aix-en-Provence. But the recruitment problem was more global, the executive added, saying he had encountered similar problems in the United States. 
As the outbreak spread across France early last year, the government rolled out one of the most generous state-financed furlough schemes in Europe while millions of office workers moved to working from home.
While people had at first enjoyed the experience, they had started to question their relationship with colleagues and their companies, the head of France's postal service La Poste said.
    ""The end of traditional contracted labour is a real question on the table,"" Philippe Wahl told one panel at the conference.
One company found that 20% of its workforce was not even bothering to regularly log into the corporate computer network at the height of lockdowns, one senior executive said he had heard.
Nearly half construction companies, 41% of service companies and a quarter of industrial companies are struggling to recruit workers, according to the Bank of France's latest business climate survey.
More fundamental issues were at play than the COVID-19 disruption, some businesses argued. Ross McInnes, the chairman of aero engine and equipment maker  Safran  (PA:SAF), said France's school system needed fixing. 
""All of our companies are struggling to recruit for jobs that are pretty well paid,"" he told one panel discussion.
Macron, a former investment banker, was backed enthusiastically by many business leaders in the last election. He has since passed some labour reforms, making it easier to hire and fire staff. 
Manufacturing and construction firms have the added headache of simply getting hold of materials they need to meet clients' orders.
Half of French construction firms and 44% of industrial companies were facing supply problems, with the rate as high as 70% for carmakers, the Bank of France's survey found.

""The supply chain is a total mess,"" the French manufacturing CEO said, adding that his firm had 23 separate task forces set up to tackle specific sourcing problems whereas the norm was one or two. The bottlenecks could last until the end of 2022, he said. 
A global shortage of transport ships and the metal containers they carry was making it difficult and expensive to receive material from overseas, forcing some to resort to flying in supplies at a higher cost, he said.

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 04, 2021 09:36AM ET</span>",China Blocks Didi From App Stores Days After Mega U.S. IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s cyberspace regulator ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing, dealing a major blow to a ride-hailing giant that just days ago pulled off one of the largest U.S. initial public offerings of the past decade.
The Cyberspace Administration of China announced the ban Sunday, citing serious violations on Didi Global Inc.’s collection and usage of personal information, without elaborating. That unusually swift decision came two days after the regulator said it was starting a cybersecurity review of the company.
That effectively requires the largest app stores in China, operated by the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and smartphone makers Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp., to strike Didi from their offerings. But the current half-billion or so users can continue to order up rides and other services so long as they downloaded the app before Sunday’s order.
The surprise probe and rapid decision by China’s powerful internet regulator piles on the scrutiny of Didi over issues ranging from antitrust to data security. The company has been grappling with a broad antitrust probe into Chinese internet firms with uncertain outcomes for Didi and peers like major backer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. It lost as much as 11% of its market value at one point on Friday, after the watchdog revealed its investigation.
More broadly, Beijing has been curbing the growing influence of China’s largest internet corporations, widening an effort to tighten the ownership and handling of troves of information that online powerhouses from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent and Didi scoop up daily from hundreds of millions of users. The regulator on Sunday ordered Didi to rectify its problems following legal requirements and national standards, and take steps to protect the personal information of its users.
On Sunday, the company said on its official social media account that it had already halted new user registrations as of July 3 and was now working to rectify its app in accordance with regulatory requirements. Didi’s IPO was led by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) In all, the ride-hailing firm appointed 20 advisers to manage the float.
The CAC didn’t specify on Friday what it will look into. But the timing of its announcements was significant, coming not just on the heels of Didi’s IPO but also the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary celebrations in Beijing.
Didi, one of the single largest investments in SoftBank Group Corp.’s portfolio, defeated Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. in China in 2016 before embarking on an ambitious international expansion. It started trading on Wednesday in New York after a $4.4 billion initial public offering, pulling off the largest debut by a Chinese firm in the U.S. after Alibaba.
But Didi had to settle on going public at a far lower market value than previously targeted. It debuted at about $67 billion, barely up from its last round of funding in 2019, and far short of the most bullish expectations for $100 billion -- a reflection of the regulatory scrutiny that’s hounded it ever since a pair of murders in 2018 that founder Cheng Wei has called its “darkest days.”
The Beijing-based firm responded to the subsequent crackdown with a fusillade of efforts to improve security across its network. It began to explore new businesses to offset slowing ride-hailing growth, from car repairs to grocery delivery. That served it well during the coronavirus pandemic, when whole cities came to a standstill. The company delivered an $837 million profit in the March quarter -- a rarity among recent high-profile IPOs like Kuaishou Technology.
The latest move against Didi underscores the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese government’s crackdown on the internet sector. Earlier this year, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced it was looking into alleged abuses -- including forced merchant exclusivity arrangements -- at Meituan, also days after China’s third-largest internet company raised $9.98 billion from a record share placement and convertible bonds sale.
“This is deeply unfair to investors,” Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital, said on Friday. “And as a crucial matter of market integrity, China’s regulators should cease allowing companies to list while under investigation.”

(Reuters) -Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson said it was time to bust out the tequila.
Standing by the seashore, the celebrity wrestler and film star put his arm around Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s founder. Bezos, in sunglasses, smiled for a picture and then shared it on the 'gram. The men had just announced a movie deal for Amazon Studios.
Bezos, 57, is stepping down as Amazon's CEO on Monday. He'll remain executive chairman and the company's biggest shareholder, but his Instagram account shows he has plenty of other interests to occupy his time.
The science fiction fan is planning a joy ride to suborbital space with his best friend and brother, Mark, this month, one recent post said. In another, Bezos is behind the wheel of an electric pickup truck built by Rivian, a startup that Amazon funded, traversing the desert in a cowboy hat to see a rocket capsule land.
The final frontier has long beckoned Bezos, who has poured billions of dollars into his company Blue Origin to promote tourism and infrastructure in space. The venture's first crewed flight is to embark July 20, less than two weeks after Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to commence a new epoch of travel beyond earth.
Bezos leaves Amazon's former cloud computing chief Andy Jassy to run a company that is bigger and more valuable than ever. It's unclear how Bezos will govern from the sidelines.
Bezos, a hedge fund executive turned garage entrepreneur, long defined Amazon's culture, through business adages like ""customer obsession"" and ""have backbone; disagree and commit,"" as well as curt emails to his team bearing just a question mark https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-bezos/with-bezos-out-as-amazon-ceo-is-this-the-end-of-his-ominous-question-mark-emails-idUSKBN2A32Z8.
Neither Amazon nor Bezos responded to a request for comment.
Bezos said in an April letter to investors that he would focus on new initiatives as executive chair and making Amazon a better place to work. That followed employee frustration that surfaced during a failed unionization campaign in Alabama.
His Instagram, though, spotlights his interest in Tinsel Town. Bezos posted about Oscar nods and Golden Globe wins for Amazon Studios, and during his last annual meeting as CEO he talked about re-imagining screen heroes for the 21st century through Amazon's deal to buy MGM.
(Not featured on his Instagram is a yacht, longer than a football field, which Bezos reportedly owns and which will come with a support yacht and helipad once it's built, according to Bloomberg News. His partner, Lauren Sanchez, is a helicopter pilot.)
Bezos has also met with public officials to draw attention to his philanthropy. He discussed his climate efforts with French President Emmanuel Macron and gave Washington Governor Jay Inslee a tour of a homeless shelter, his posts show.

He's had some fun with music stars Katy Perry, Lil Nas X and Lizzo, too.
He posted from the Super Bowl in 2020, ""I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% @lizzobeeating's biggest fan.""

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Investors eye high-dividend stocks as Treasury yields languish,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Expectations that Treasury yields may stay tame in the second half of the year are pushing some investors to take a second look at companies whose dividend payouts beat those offered on U.S. government bonds.
The ProShares S&P Dividend Aristocrats ETF - a measure of companies that have increased their dividends annually for the last 25 years or more - is up 14.3% this year, compared to a 15.8% rise for the benchmark S&P 500.
Some investors believe these stocks may be a good bet in coming months, however, as a more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve and signs of peaking growth dent expectations that Treasury yields will resume a surge that began in the first quarter but has more recently died down.
The S&P Dividend Aristocrats index pays a dividend yield of 2.15%, while the 10-year Treasury pays a dividend yield of 1.48%. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF remains about 4% below its May peak. 
""Increasingly, the market will focus on companies with the potential for growing payouts and rising current returns,"" said Bob Leininger, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.
Overall, dividend payouts in the S&P 500 will grow by 6% this year and next, well above the 0.8% growth rate implied by current valuations, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs. Of the 57 companies that decreased or suspended their dividends in 2020, 22 have resumed or increased their dividends and another 19 will likely increase their dividends by the end of the year, the firm estimates. 
Financial companies will likely lead the way for dividend increases after the Federal Reserve relaxed limitations on payouts and buy-back's, noted Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management
Firms including  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said on June 28 they were hiking their payouts after they passed the Fed's stress tests, which evaluate how companies would fare in a significant economic downturn. Overall, the total buy-back and dividend payouts from financial companies will likely top $130 billion, according to analyst estimates. 
Leininger said that he is starting to target companies such as brewer  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) Beverage Co, which suspended its dividend last year but said in April that it expects to reinstate it by the end of 2021. 
Shares of the company are up nearly 19% for the year to date. 
Dividend-paying stocks trade at below 18 times forward earnings, a small discount relative to their historical median -- increasing their allure in a market where valuations are elevated compared to historical levels, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS).
""We anticipate that dividends will increase at a rate above inflation over the next several years, offering investors the opportunity to generate their own cash flow in a yield-starved world,"" she said. 
Investors may get a deeper glimpse at the Federal Reserve's views on inflation when the minutes from its most recent meeting are released Wednesday, while the ISM reading of service industry activity is set to be released on Tuesday. The index hit a record high in May as the economy recovery accelerated. 
Dividend-paying stocks look to be in a sweet spot, offering stable payouts that are expected to increase if the economic rebound continues, said Burns McKinney of NFJ Investment Group.

McKinney is looking at companies that suspended or cut their dividends during the widespread economic lockdowns last year and will likely increase them this year. 
""You've got a number of companies that are going to keep up with inflation and you're going to get rewarded in the meantime"" through rising dividend payouts, he said. This includes companies such as industrial firm Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) and technology firm Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc as well as the S&P 500 energy sector, he said.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2021 11:40PM ET</span>","Amazon, Tata say Indian govt e-commerce rules will hit businesses -sources","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc and India's Tata Group warned government officials on Saturday that plans for tougher rules for online retailers would have a major impact on their business models, four sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
At a meeting organised by the consumer affairs ministry and the government's investment promotion arm, Invest India, many executives expressed concerns and confusion over the proposed rules and asked that the July 6 deadline for submitting comments be extended, said the sources.
The government's tough new e-commerce rules announced on June 21 aimed at strengthening protection for consumers, caused concern among the country's online retailers, notably market leaders Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart.
New rules limiting flash sales, barring misleading advertisements and mandating a complaints system, among other proposals, could force the likes of Amazon and Flipkart to review their business structures, and may increase costs for domestic rivals including Reliance Industries' JioMart, BigBasket and Snapdeal.
Amazon argued that COVID-19 had already hit small businesses and the proposed rules will have a huge impact on its sellers, arguing that some clauses were already covered by existing law, two of the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be named as the discussions were private. 
The proposed policy states e-commerce firms must ensure none of their related enterprises are listed as sellers on their websites. That could impact Amazon in particular as it holds an indirect stake in at least two of its sellers, Cloudtail and Appario.
On that proposed clause, a representative of Tata Sons, the holding company of India's $100 billion Tata Group, argued that it was problematic, citing an example to say it would stop Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) - which has a joint-venture with Tata in India - from offering its products on Tata's marketplace website. 
The Tata executive said the rules will have wide ramifications for the conglomerate, and could restrict sales of its private brands, according to two of the sources. 
Tata declined to comment.
The sources said that a consumer ministry official argued that the rules were meant to protect consumers and were not as strict as those of other countries. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A Reliance executive agreed that the proposed rules would boost consumer confidence, but added that some clauses needed clarification. 
Reliance did not respond to request for comment.
The rules were announced last month amid growing complaints from India's brick-and-mortar retailers that Amazon and Flipkart bypass foreign investment law using complex business strcutures. The companies deny any wrongdoing.

A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation in February cited Amazon documents that showed it gave preferential treatment to a small number of its sellers and bypassed foreign investment rules. Amazon has said it does not give favourable treatment to any seller. 
The government will soon issue certain clarifications on the foreign investment rules, Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyal told reporters on Friday.

Following are some details about the buyers of the 122-year-old Bradford, northern England, based grocer:
FORTRESS INVESTMENT GROUP
Fortress is an independently-operated global investment manager subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. As of March 31, it had about $53 billion in assets under management.
It bought British wine seller Majestic Wine for 95 million pounds in 2019 and has invested in the grocery sector in the United States - in Albertsons, A&P and Fresh and Easy (which used to be owned by Tesco).
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD (CPP INVESTMENTS)
CPP Investments invests the funds transferred to it by the Canada Pension Plan.
As of March 31 2021, it had about 287 billion pounds of assets under management, of which about 13.6 billion is invested in the United Kingdom.
KOCH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (KREI)
KREI is part of Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held businesses in the United States.
Since 2003, Koch companies have invested nearly $133 billion.

It has a presence in more than 70 countries, employing 122,000 people worldwide.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>",Britain's Morrisons agrees $8.7 billion takeover by Fortress-led group,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Morrisons has agreed to a takeover led by SoftBank owned Fortress Investment Group that values Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain at 6.3 billion pounds ($8.7 billion) and tops a rival offer from a U.S. private equity firm.
The offer from Fortress, along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments, exceeds a 5.52 billion pound unsolicited proposal from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which Morrisons rejected on June 19.
However, it was less than the 6.5 billion pounds asked for by top 10 Morrisons investor JO Hambro last week.
Shareholders will get to vote on the Fortress offer, which gives the supermarket chain an enterprise value of 9.5 billion pounds once its net debt of 3.2 billion is taken into account.
Under British takeover rules CD&R has until July 17 to come back with a firm offer. CD&R declined to comment.
Analysts have also speculated that other private equity groups and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could enter the fray in a potential bidding war. 
The Fortress deal underlines the growing appetite from private funds for British supermarket chains, which are seen as attractive because of their cash generation and freehold assets.
    ""We have looked very carefully at Fortress' approach, their plans for the business and their overall suitability as an owner of a unique British food-maker and shopkeeper with over 110,000 colleagues and an important role in British food production and farming,"" said Morrisons Chairman Andrew Higginson.
""It's clear to us that Fortress has a full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons.""
'GOOD STEWARDS'
Fortress, an independently-operated subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, is a global investment manager with about $53 billion in assets under management as of March. It purchased British wine seller Majestic Wine in 2019.
""We are committed to being good stewards of Morrisons to best serve its stakeholder groups, and the wider British public, for the long term,"" said managing partner Joshua A. Pack.
But Britain's opposition Labour Party called for close scrutiny from the government.
""Ministers must urgently work with Morrisons and the consortium to ensure that crucial commitments to protect the workforce and the pension scheme are legally binding, and met,"" said Labour's spokeswoman on business Seema Malhotra.
Fortress intends to retain Morrisons' Bradford, northern England, headquarters and its existing management team led by CEO David Potts and execute its existing strategy. Material store sale and leaseback transactions are not planned.
Potts would make 9.2 million pounds by selling his shares to Fortress, while chief operating officer Trevor Strain would pocket 3.6 million pounds.
Under the terms of the deal, which Morrisons' board is recommending to shareholders, investors would receive 254 pence a share - 252 pence in cash and a 2 pence special cash dividend. CD&R's proposal was 230 pence a share.
Morrisons started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899. It now only trails UK market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda in annual sales.
Morrisons owns 85% of its nearly 500 stores and has 19 mostly freehold manufacturing sites. It is unique among British supermarkets in making over half of the fresh food it sells.
It said the Fortress offer represented a premium of 42% to its closing share price of 178 pence on June 18 - the day before CD&R's proposal. The stock closed at 243 pence on Friday.
FIVE PROPOSALS    
Morrisons said an initial unsolicited proposal was received from Fortress on May 4 at 220 pence a share. This offer was not made public. Fortress then made four subsequent proposals before it offered a total value of 254 a share on June 5.
The bids for Morrisons follow February's purchase by Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital of a majority stake in Asda from Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The deal valued Asda at 6.8 billion pounds. 
That transaction followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda after an agreed deal was blocked by Britain's competition regulator in 2019.

In April, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake in Sainsbury's to almost 10%, igniting bid speculation.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Didi says it stores all China user and roads data in China,"By Scott Murdoch and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -China's ride hailing giant Didi Global Inc stores all China user and roads data at servers in the country and it is ""absolutely not possible"" that the company passed data to the United States, a senior company executive said on Saturday.
Didi Vice President Li Min also said the company would sue any social media users who said the company transferred data during its recent initial public offering (IPO) process after claims were made on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform.
China's cyberspace agency announced on Friday it had launched an investigation into Didi to protect national security and the public interest, just two days after the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
News of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) probe, and the agency's decision to block Didi from registering new users during its investigation, knocked 5% off Beijing-based Didi's shares on Friday.
""Like many overseas-listed Chinese companies, Didi stores all domestic user data at servers in China, it is absolutely not possible to pass data to the United States,"" Li said in a post on Weibo.
Didi, which offers services in China and more than 15 international markets, gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis.
Founded by Will Cheng in 2012, the company has already faced regulatory probes in China over safety and its operations licence.
""I'm not sure what the final implications might be but regulatory crackdown has been an ongoing concern even before the listing, with Didi already having been called in by the regulators twice,"" said Sumeet Singh, Aequitas Research director who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters on Saturday, before Li's post.
""This time stopping the company from taking in new users shouldn't hurt a whole lot since the company already has 80% plus market share to begin with, as long as its not extended for a period of time.""

The cyberspace agency did not give any indication of how the long the investigation would last or provide any other details.
Didi said on Friday it planned to conduct a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and would cooperate fully with the relevant government authority. It also said apart from the suspension of new user registrations in China, it was operating normally.

HONG KONG/ZURICH (Reuters) -Syngenta Group will use the proceeds from its expected $10 billion initial public offering (IPO) to fund internal growth and an acquisition spree to snare more of the $100 billion market for seeds and sprays, the agrichemical giant said on Friday.
The company's prospectus to list on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market was posted online by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday, confirming details reported this week by Reuters after the application was filed on Wednesday.
""Syngenta Group will expand and renovate its production facility and implement strategic acquisition to meet growing market needs,"" the company said in the document.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange filing showed Syngenta’s application to list on the STAR Market had been accepted and the company plans to issue up to 2.79 billion shares.
Syngenta's IPO still requires the approval of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and registration with the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
The flotation, set to be the world's biggest this year, will value the maker of pesticides and seeds based in Basel, Switzerland, at about $60 billion including debt, or $50 billion without, sources have told Reuters.
The float is expected to be bigger than video-sharing platform Kuaishou Technology's $6.2 billion Hong Kong IPO. It will likely be the two-year-old STAR board's biggest - a major boost after the 11th-hour scrapping of Ant Group's blockbuster listing last year due to regulatory trouble.
The filing means the flotation is likely to take place by the end by 2021, said the sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
A secondary listing for Syngenta is also being considered that could take place less than a year after its debut, with exchanges in Zurich, London and New York among the options being examined, the people said. 
Proceeds will fund acquisitions, including deals already announced to buy Yangnong Agrochemical and Valagro, the filing said.
Cash raised will also be used on other projects such as advanced agricultural technology research, production expansion, and upgrading and maintaining its facilities.
Funds will also be used to expand further its modern agricultural service platform - which trains farmers in China - and to repay long-term debt, it said.
The Swiss seeds and crop protection giant was bought in 2017 for $43 billion by ChemChina, which was folded into Sinochem Holdings Corp this year.
The acquisition remains China's biggest takeover of a foreign company and is aimed at using Syngenta's top-tier chemicals and patent-protected seeds to drastically improve domestic agricultural output.
Since being taken over, Syngenta has been merged with Israeli agrochemical firm ADAMA and the fertiliser and seed business of Sinochem.
Syngenta, the world's No.1 crop protection maker and No. 3 seed supplier, competes with Germany's BASF, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) in the speeds and sprays market.
The company employs 49,000 people globally and generated sales of $23.1 billion in 2020. Its biggest markets are the United States and Brazil, while it is growing rapidly in China.
Syngenta reported first-quarter sales of $7.1 billion, 20% higher year-on-year, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rising 19% to $1.5 billion. 

Net profit rose 72% in the first quarter, the prospectus said.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 09:15PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors eye high-dividend stocks as Treasury yields languish,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations that Treasury yields may stay tame in the second half of the year are pushing some investors to take a second look at companies whose dividend payouts beat those offered on U.S. government bonds.
The ProShares S&P Dividend Aristocrats ETF - a measure of companies that have increased their dividends annually for the last 25 years or more - is up 14.3% this year, compared to a 15.8% rise for the benchmark S&P 500.
Some investors believe these stocks may be a good bet in coming months, however, as a more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve and signs of peaking growth dent expectations that Treasury yields will resume a surge that began in the first quarter but has more recently died down.
The S&P Dividend Aristocrats index pays a dividend yield of 2.15%, while the 10-year Treasury pays a dividend yield of 1.48%. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF remains about 4% below its May peak. 
""Increasingly, the market will focus on companies with the potential for growing payouts and rising current returns,"" said Bob Leininger, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.
Overall, dividend payouts in the S&P 500 will grow by 6% this year and next, well above the 0.8% growth rate implied by current valuations, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs. Of the 57 companies that decreased or suspended their dividends in 2020, 22 have resumed or increased their dividends and another 19 will likely increase their dividends by the end of the year, the firm estimates. 
Financial companies will likely lead the way for dividend increases after the Federal Reserve relaxed limitations on payouts and buy-back's, noted Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management
Firms including  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said on June 28 they were hiking their payouts after they passed the Fed's stress tests, which evaluate how companies would fare in a significant economic downturn. Overall, the total buy-back and dividend payouts from financial companies will likely top $130 billion, according to analyst estimates. 
Leininger said that he is starting to target companies such as brewer  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) Beverage Co, which suspended its dividend last year but said in April that it expects to reinstate it by the end of 2021. 
Shares of the company are up nearly 19% for the year to date. 
Dividend-paying stocks trade at below 18 times forward earnings, a small discount relative to their historical median -- increasing their allure in a market where valuations are elevated compared to historical levels, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS).
""We anticipate that dividends will increase at a rate above inflation over the next several years, offering investors the opportunity to generate their own cash flow in a yield-starved world,"" she said. 
Investors may get a deeper glimpse at the Federal Reserve's views on inflation when the minutes from its most recent meeting are released Wednesday, while the ISM reading of service industry activity is set to be released on Tuesday. The index hit a record high in May as the economy recovery accelerated. 
Dividend-paying stocks look to be in a sweet spot, offering stable payouts that are expected to increase if the economic rebound continues, said Burns McKinney of NFJ Investment Group.

McKinney is looking at companies that suspended or cut their dividends during the widespread economic lockdowns last year and will likely increase them this year. 
""You've got a number of companies that are going to keep up with inflation and you're going to get rewarded in the meantime"" through rising dividend payouts, he said. This includes companies such as industrial firm Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) and technology firm Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc as well as the S&P 500 energy sector, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House economic adviser Brian Deese on Friday said the United States was still working to get more countries to join an agreement signed this week by 130 countries backing a global corporate minimum tax of at least 15%.
The deal will help create momentum for President Joe Biden's push to increase corporate tax rates at home, while helping to raise revenue needed for a variety of investments, Deese told reporters at the White House.
Officials from 130 of the 139 countries taking part in talks lead by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday agreed to the broad overhaul of rules for taxing international companies.
Among the holdouts were Ireland, Hungary and Estonia - all members of the European Union that have sought to attract investment with low tax rates.
""This is a process,"" Deese said. ""We've going to keep working at it. We're not there. This is a milestone in the process, but a real strong signal of momentum toward the ultimate goal.""
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters after a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that he expected rapid implementation of the global tax deal by the EU despite the refusal of several members to sign the deal.
""I am optimistic,"" he said, adding that he expected the Group of 20 major economies to join the Group of Seven (G7) nations in endorsing the plan at next week's G7 finance officials meeting in Venice.

The OECD said an implementation plan and other remaining issues will be finalized by October, with the deal expected to be implemented in 2023, according to the OECD.
The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, on Thursday also urged holdout countries to join the deal, saying it would be in their own interest to do so.

(Reuters) -A decades-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-200 cargo airplane with two people on board made an emergency nighttime landing in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, early on Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said.
The FAA said both crew members were rescued, citing preliminary information.
""The pilots had reported engine trouble and were attempting to return to Honolulu when they were forced to land the aircraft in the water,"" the FAA said in a statement.
The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate.
Transair Flight 810 departed Honolulu at 1:33 a.m. local time bound for Maui's Kahului airport but quickly turned back toward Honolulu, according to aviation data from FlightAware.com.
Shortly after, the Coast Guard responded to reports of the downed plane south of the island of Oahu with two people on board. Around 2:30 a.m., a Coast Guard helicopter located the debris field and found one of the crew members clinging to the plane's tail. That person was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.
The other survivor was spotted on top of some floating packages and was picked up by a Honolulu Fire Department rescue boat for transport to shore, according to a spokesperson from the U.S. Coast Guard.
Both were being evaluated by medical personnel and their current condition was unknown.
The crew knew they were in trouble. 
""We've lost number one engine,"" one of the pilots told Honolulu air traffic control in a recording posted on LiveATC, an audio streaming site that broadcasts air traffic control communications. 
""We are going to need the fire department ... We're going to lose the other engine, too. It's running very hot.""
Boeing said it was closely monitoring the situation and was in contact with the NTSB. The airplane was built by Boeing in 1975, according to FAA records. The plane was first delivered to Pacific Western Airlines and joined Transair's fleet in 2014, according to Flightradar24.com.
The plane was equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines. Pratt & Whitney said it was supporting the NTSB's investigation.
Rhoades Aviation Inc does business as Transair, which is one of Hawaii’s largest air cargo carriers and has been in business since 1982. It has a fleet of five Boeing 737s that fly daily to all major Hawaiian island destinations, according to its website.
Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc, the insurance broker for Boeing, declined to comment.
Shares of Boeing were trading slightly lower on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

Boeing's 737 MAX was cleared to fly by regulators late last year after a 20-month grounding following two accidents that killed hundreds of people.
The 737 in Friday's incident was an older generation than the MAX.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 06:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street hits record on robust June jobs data,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street scaled new highs on Friday, with the S&P closing up for a seventh straight day, after jobs data for June showed robust hiring yet persistent weakness in the labor market that will keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates any time soon.
The three major U.S. indices - the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq - closed at record highs. The streak was the longest run of consecutive record closes since June 1997, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The Labor Department's employment report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs last month, but the total is 6.8 million below its peak in February 2020. 
The better-than-expected data was a tentative sign that a labor shortage overhanging the U.S. economy was starting to ease but was not enough to force the Fed to raise rates.
Big tech led stocks on Wall Street higher while the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slid to 1.431%. 
""For capital markets, equities and bonds, this was a goldilocks report,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Wealth & Investment Management. ""There were enough jobs that you'd want to see, but not so much that it concerns people that the Fed may have to act sooner.""
Investors have feared a stronger-than-expected recovery and the prospect of surging inflation that could force the Fed to pare its support and raise rates, hurting technology shares whose growth and cash flow is farther in the future.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) added the most to the S&P's broad advance, followed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Financial stocks, which earn less on lower rates, fell as did utilities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 152.82 points, or 0.44%, to 34,786.35, the S&P 500 gained 32.4 points, or 0.75%, to 4,352.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 116.95 points, or 0.81%, to 14,639.33.
For the week, the S&P rose 1.7%, the Dow added 1.0%, the nasdaq gained 1.9%.
Trading was light heading into the long weekend, with U.S. markets shut on Monday in observance of Independence Day. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.95 billion shares, compared with the 10.81 billion average for a full session over the last 20 trading days.
Headwinds that have weighed on hiring, including jobless benefits and vaccine concerns, are likely to diminish in the fall and might help jobs growth accelerate, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP).
""But for now, the recovery in the labor market is not so robust as to bring forward any further the Fed's eventual tightening,"" Joy said. 
The report served as evidence of the economy's ongoing recovery, said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
""Some of the most impaired corners of the U.S. economy, namely retail, leisure and hospitality, showed some of the strongest improvements,"" Northey said. 
Focus now shifts towards the second-quarter earnings season and progress on President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill that could help the equity market keep the momentum.
Investors will look to minutes from the Fed's June meeting next week for the latest view on inflation, bond tapering and rates at a time when the easy monetary stance appears to be at an inflection point amid a booming U.S. economy.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rose 0.15% after it posted record vehicle deliveries for the second quarter that also beat Wall Street estimates. The stock was lower much of the session. CEO Elon Musk has warned of challenges securing chips and raw materials.
Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) rose 4.1% after the space tourism firm said billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson would travel to the edge of space on the company's test flight on July 11, beating out fellow aspiring billionaire astronaut Jeff Bezos.
Didi Global Inc fell 5.3% after China's cyberspace administration said it would conduct a new investigation into the Chinese ride-hailing giant to protect national security and the public interest.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 45 new lows.

(Reuters) -AMC Entertainment shares closed down 4% on Friday after short-seller Iceberg Research tweeted that it had made a bearish bet against the theater chain operator's stock.
The so-called meme stock closed at $51.96 after falling almost 12% to $47.77 in morning trading after Iceberg's tweet that it had sold the shares short, which involves borrowing shares with a view to buying them back at a lower price to cover the bet. 
""Our position is based on the fundamentals of the company and the fact its stock price has been inflated by call options, which is always temporary,"" said Iceberg's Arnaud Vagner in an email to Reuters. 
Bearish investors forced to unwind their bets in the face of a rapidly rising stock price have helped fuel rallies this year in AMC, video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other companies that are popular on online forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. 
AMC shares, while well below their June 2 peak of $72.62, were still up more than 2,500% year-to-date after finishing 2020 at $2.12. 
Vagner said that while there are risks associated with betting against meme stocks, ""any sharp rise is followed by a correction. This is inevitable.""
Little is known about Iceberg, which publishes a blog with its research on Wordpress. Vagner said Iceberg is a company that makes both long and short bets but declined to give further details.
Iceberg gained attention in 2015 for highlighting what it called aggressive accounting practices at Hong Kong-based Noble Group https://www.reuters.com/article/us-noble-group-debt-focus/back-from-the-brink-how-noble-group-was-saved-from-an-iceberg-collision-idUSKCN1LK0GI. Commodities trader Noble denied the allegations but subsequently saw its profits collapse and was forced to sell most of its assets. 
Vagner, who said he worked at Noble Group and in credit analyst roles at banks before launching Iceberg in 2015, declined to reveal details of the firm's short position.
AMC's latest rally was helped by heavy trading of equity options, financial derivatives that give buyers the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price in the future, depending on where the stock price is.
As the share price skyrocketed, market makers who sold AMC options were forced to buy the company’s shares to offset their exposure, driving the stock higher in a phenomenon known as a gamma squeeze.
AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""These meme stocks are so volatile in their trading it doesn't take much to get a big move up or down,"" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, whose AMC rating is ""sell"" with a $1 price target.

Handler said that AMC's trading price multiple of 45 times his 2022 estimate for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) compares to a historic peak multiple of 9 times EBITDA estimates for movie theater stocks before the coronavirus pandemic.
""At some point in time, I don't know when that'll be, inevitably there has to be some type of mean reversion with AMC. I don't think it can permanently sustain a 45 times EBITDA multiple,"" Handler said.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc plans to award incoming Chief Executive Andy Jassy more than $200 million in extra stock, which will pay out over 10 years, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will record the grant of 61,000 shares on July 5, the filing said. That's the date Jassy succeeds Jeff Bezos in the online retailer's first CEO transition since its founding in 1994. As of Friday's close, those shares are worth about $214 million.
The award's exact value will depend on how the shares are trading when they pay out in future years, encouraging Jassy to grow a company that's worth $1.77 trillion today. Though Amazon did not disclose the vesting schedule, its previous stock grants have not vested right away.
Jassy's base salary has been $175,000, filings show. On top of that, he has $45.3 million in previously awarded stock that is vesting this year and had $41.5 million vest in 2020.
The annual median pay at Amazon was $29,007 last year across full, part-time and temporary employees worldwide, excluding Bezos, whose base salary was $81,840. The founder's outsized stake in Amazon has made him the richest person in the world.
Jassy's vested equity was still smaller than payouts to rival CEOs in the technology industry.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Satya Nadella had $215 million in stock vest for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, on top of a base salary of $2.5 million, for instance. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Tim Cook had $281.9 million in stock vest, according to its 2021 proxy.
Some governance experts have criticized such pay schemes because they reward executives irrespective of whether they achieve corporate milestones. Stock grants can be more appropriate for startups than for established companies like Amazon, said, John C. Coffee Jr., director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School.

“It is rewarding compensation a little prematurely,” Coffee said. “It’s like winning the prize for the race before the race is won.”
Amazon plans to stop its prior biannual stock grants to Jassy, aiming for the latest award to account for most of his compensation in the coming years, a person familiar with the matter said.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden plans to nominate a senior lawyer for a U.S. House of Representatives committee to chair the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), along with a lawyer at the agency for another commissioner slot, the White House said.
Biden announced late on Friday that he intends to nominate Alexander Hoehn-Saric, a Democrat who is chief counsel for the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on communications and consumer protection to head the CPSC. Reuters reported the planned nominations earlier.
Hoehn-Saric works on legislation and oversight related to product safety, consumer protection, and communications.
The Democratic president also plans to nominate Mary Boyle to the commission, the White House said. She is the CPSC's current executive director and has spent more than a decade at the agency in senior positions.
""American families need a strong cop on the beat at the Consumer Product Safety Commission,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said in a statement, adding Hoehn-Saric, who is also a former Senate Commerce Committee senior counsel ""has been at the forefront of the fight for a strong CPSC to protect consumers, children, and families from dangerous products.""In December 2019, Senate Democrats said in a report that the CPSC was inappropriately deferential to companies it investigates.

Settlements reached by the commission under Republican then-President Donald Trump ""are at odds with traditional recall agreements negotiated by the CPSC,” the Senate Commerce Committee report said.
“Rather than providing consumers with a specific remedy that repairs all impacted products or a refund to remove the dangerous products from homes, these recalls perversely serve as marketing tools to allow the recalling company to sell additional products,” the report found.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global shares rose on Friday, hitting an all-time high on lift from a better-than-expected U.S. monthly jobs report that signaled a strong end to the second quarter in the world's largest economy.
There were weak spots in the jobs report, including a slight uptick in the U.S. unemployment rate, and the dollar dropped from a three-month high.
Data showed U.S. job growth accelerated in June as nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs after rising by 583,000 in May, although the unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8% the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 700,000 jobs. 
The MSCI All Country World index closed at 725.41, up 0.39% on the day. The pan-European STOXX 600 index settled 0.26% higher. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs.

The benchmark 10-year yield was down 3.9 basis points at 1.4407%. Euro zone government bond yields fell, as investor fears over the rise in COVID-19 cases outweighed strong U.S. data. Germany's 10-year bond yield, the euro zone benchmark, dropped to -0.24%, its lowest since mid-June.
The dollar slipped from a three-month high, pressured by the weaker details of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
U.S. employment remains about 6.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. There are a record 9.3 million job openings. The dollar index fell 0.375 points or 0.4% to 92.222.
The Japanese yen was last down 0.39 percent, at $111.0600.
While prospects of a strong economic recovery underpinned equity markets, investors remain nervous that a sharp recovery from the pandemic could boost inflation to an uncomfortable level for the Fed.
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has said massive U.S. fiscal spending will set off inflationary pressures not seen in a generation. Others argue that until wage pressures return in force, a return to 1970s-style inflation is unlikely.
Spot gold prices rose $4.71 or 0.27%, to $1,781.31 an ounce.

OPEC+ resumed talks on raising oil output a day after the United Arab Emirates blocked a deal. The standoff could delay plans to pump more oil through the end of the year to cool prices that have soared to 2-1/2 year highs.

So, as such, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.The pandemic-driven global industrial shutdown last year resulted in the slow down or idling of automobile plants. A global semiconductor chip shortage has depressed automobile production significantly too. But the demand for new cars has been rising sharply over the past couple of months. This is evident in a 34% year-over-year rise in new car sales in May, compared to a 10.6% growth in May 2019.
As of May, the average new car price hit a record $38,255, 12% higher from the same period last year. In the used car market, prices are up 39% since the beginning of this year. This trend is expected to continue, owing to low car inventories amid surging demand.
Given this backdrop, we think shares of auto retailers CarGurus, Inc. (CARG) and Cars.com Inc. (CARS) are well positioned to deliver solid returns in the coming months.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended the week at record highs Friday, as a stronger jobs report pointed to underlying strength in the economy, sending U.S. bond yields lower, and tech stocks higher.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to a closing high of 4,352.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, or 145 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.8% to the day at a closing record of 14,639.33.
The economy created 850,000 jobs in June, a sharp increase from the 583,000 in April, well ahead of economists’ forecast of 720,000.  It was the largest gain in 10 months.
”Labor shortages are still an issue, but employers seem to be adjusting to the new reality and finding ways to attract workers with higher wages and/or sign-on bonuses,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report.
Average hourly earnings climbed 0.3% in June increase in wages, but that was “distorted by disproportional job gains in leisure & hospitality and retail,” Jefferies added. “After adjusting for industry mix shifts, wages rose by 0.5% month-on-month in June, and are up 4.5% year-on-year.”
The expected increase in the wages will likely boost inflation and may lead to the tightening its monetary policy sooner than expected.
“If this trend does materializes this will be a key factor that will mean inflation stays elevated for even longer. We believe headline inflation will stay above 4% well into 2022 and take the view that it is increasingly probable the Federal Reserve will end up raising interest rates in 2022,” ING said.
U.S. bond prices, which trade inversely to yields, shrugged off the prospect of the sooner rather than later monetary policy, to trade higher. Falling bond yields, the ally of stocks with higher valuations, helped lift tech stocks. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up about quarter of the S&P 500 weighting were up more than 1%.

So, two established medical equipment companies, Asensus (ASXC) and Surgaline (SRGA), should benefit in the coming months. But let’s see which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Asensus Surgical, Inc. (ASXC) in Morrisville, N.C., and Surgalign Holdings, Inc. (SRGA) in Deerfield, Ill., are two established players in the medical equipment space. ASXC is a medical device company that digitizes the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery through digital laparoscopy. It enables the use of advanced capabilities, such as augmented intelligence, connectivity and robotics in laparoscopy, and addresses the current clinical, cognitive, and economic shortcomings in surgery. SRGA is a medical technology company that designs, develops, manufactures and distributes biologic, metal and synthetic implants. Its product portfolio includes cervical fixation, The Streamline (TL) fixation, motion preservation, orthobiologics, cervical inter-body fusion, TL IBF, and SI joint fusion.
The medical equipment industry suffered a big decline in demand amid the pandemic last year due to the postponement of several elective surgeries as hospitals focused overwhelmingly on treating patients with COVID-19. However, with the success of a widespread vaccination program this year, which has reduced COVID-19 cases significantly, the demand for elective surgeries is on the rise. Consequently, medical equipment companies are benefiting. And investors’ keen interest in the medical equipment stocks is evident in the SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE) 14.1% returns so far this year.
According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global medical devices market is projected to grow at a 5.4% CAGR to $657.98 billion in 2028. As such, ASXC and SRGA could witness increasing demand for their products and services.

Furthermore, rising demand from the manufacturing and construction industries amid the current economic recovery should drive the industry’s growth in the coming months. Thus, we believe mid-cap steel companies Reliance Steel & Aluminum (RS), Ternium S.A. (TX), and Aperam S.A. (APEMY (OTC:APEMY)) should deliver solid returns in the near term. Let’s evaluate these names.On June 24, President Biden announced his support for a $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which, if passed into law, would be the largest long-term investment in U.S. infrastructure in nearly a century. This infrastructure plan is at the core of Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda to rebuild the U.S. economy and eliminate prevailing structural weaknesses.
The potentially transformational investment creates room for immense opportunities and growth for the steel industry, owing to steel’s widespread use in construction. Furthermore, rising construction and manufacturing activities with the economy’s reopening should keep driving the demand for steel. The domestic raw steel production capability utilization rate hit 82.3% at the beginning of June, its highest rate since early 2020. A recent survey conducted by S&P Global Platts indicates that finished-steel prices in the United States are expected to rise throughout this month.
Considering the steel industry’s growth prospects, we think mid-cap steel stocks Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (RS), Ternium S.A. (TX), and Aperam S.A. (APEMY) could generate solid returns in the coming months.

”Labor shortages are still an issue, but employers seem to be adjusting to the new reality and finding ways to attract workers with higher wages and/or sign-on bonuses,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report.
Average hourly earnings climbed 0.3% in June increase in wages, but that was “distorted by disproportional job gains in leisure & hospitality and retail,” Jefferies added. “After adjusting for industry mix shifts, wages rose by 0.5% month-on-month in June, and are up 4.5% year-on-year.”
The expected increase in the wages will likely boost inflation and may lead to the tightening its monetary policy sooner than expected.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm Ltd would better support the creation of UK technology jobs than the SoftBank Group Corp unit becoming a standalone public company once again, Arm's chief executive said on Friday.
""We contemplated an IPO but determined that the pressure to deliver short-term revenue growth and profitability would suffocate our ability to invest, expand, move fast and innovate,"" Arm CEO Simon Segars wrote in a blog post https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/arm-nvidia.
""Combining with Nvidia will give us the scale, resources and agility needed to maximize the opportunities ahead,"" Segars wrote.
Last week, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon told The Telegraph newspaper https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/06/13/qualcomm-ready-invest-arm-40bn-nvidia-sales-collapses and other media outlets that Qualcomm was open to investing in an initial public offering by Arm if the Nvidia deal falls apart. Amon has told media outlets that joint ownership of Arm by industry peers would keep the firm independent.
Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nvidia last year announced its plan to acquire Cambridge, England-based Arm, long a neutral supplier of chip design technology, from the Japanese conglomerate, which does not own any other chip companies.
Critics like  Qualcomm Inc  have argued that allowing Arm to be owned by one chip company could cause it to focus on technologies that benefit its owner rather than the broader industry.

The deal is under regulatory scrutiny in the United States, United Kingdom and European Union.
SoftBank bought Arm for $32 billion in 2016, betting on a surge in what are called internet-of-things (IoT) chips. Arm invested heavily in hiring to purse the technology. But the IoT market failed to produce a revenue boom for Arm, and the company later raised prices https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-arm-exclusive/exclusive-arm-raises-prices-on-chip-technology-for-some-customers-sources-say-idUSKCN24G1RM for some of its technologies, angering some customers.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive-New Saudi airline plan takes aim at Emirates, Qatar Airways","By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia plans to target international transit passenger traffic with its new national airline, going head-to-head with Gulf giants Emirates and Qatar Airways and opening up a new front in simmering regional competition.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing economic diversification to wean Saudi Arabia off oil revenues and create jobs, announced a transportation and logistics drive on Tuesday aimed at making the kingdom the fifth-biggest air transit hub.
Two people familiar with the matter said the new airline would boost international routes and echo existing Gulf carriers by carrying people from one country to another via connections in the kingdom, known in the industry as sixth-freedom traffic.
The transport ministry, which has not released details of the plans, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The strategy marks a shift for Saudi Arabia whose other airlines, like state-owned Saudia and its low cost subsidiary flyadeal, mostly operate domestic services and point-to-point flights to and from the country of 35 million people.
The Saudi expansion threatens to sharpen a battle for passengers at a time when travel has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Long-haul flights like those operated by Emirates and Qatar Airways are forecast to take the longest to recover.
Riyadh has already moved to compete with the UAE, the region's business, trade and tourism hub. The Saudi government has said that from 2024 it would stop giving contracts to firms that do not set up regional headquarters in the kingdom.
""Commercial competition in the aviation industry has always been fierce, and regional competition is heating up. Some turbulence in regional relations is on the horizon,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute.
Dubai, the world's largest international air travel hub, has announced a five-year plan to grow air and shipping routes by 50% and double tourism capacity over the next two decades. 
Riyadh has already moved to compete with the UAE, the region's business, trade and tourism hub. The Saudi government has said that starting 2024 it would stop giving contracts to firms that do not set up regional headquarters in the kingdom.
Prince Mohammed is trying to lure foreign capital to create new industries including tourism, with ambitions to increase overall visitors to 100 million by 2030 from 40 million in 2019.
""Saudi Arabia has the ability to push forward with its aviation and tourism strategy when others will be retreating and retracting,"" aviation consultant Brendan Sobie said. 
""It is a risky strategy, but also sensible given its position and overall diversification objective."" 
TOURISM PUSH
However, any airline requires substantial start-up capital and experts warn that if Saudi Arabia's ambition is to compete on transit flights it may have to contend with years of losses.
Saudi Arabia's large population generates direct traffic that could cushion losses as a new airline targets international transit traffic, aviation consultant John Strickland said. 
Emirates reported a record $5.5 billion annual loss last month with the pandemic forcing Dubai to step in with $3.1 billion in state support. 
Etihad Airways has scaled back its ambitions after it spent billions of dollars to ultimately unsuccessfully compete in building a major hub in United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi.
People familiar with the matter said the new airline could be based in the capital Riyadh, and that sovereign wealth fund PIF is helping set it up. 

PIF did not respond to a request for comment. 
Saudi Arabia is developing non-religious tourism with mega projects backed by PIF. It has launched social reforms to open up the country, the birthplace of Islam, including allowing public entertainment.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is investing in a U.S. lithium project that could become the country's largest by 2024, making the automaker one of the first to develop its own source of a battery metal crucial for the electrification of cars and trucks.
The deal, announced on Friday, comes as automakers around the world scramble for access to lithium and other electric vehicle (EV) metals as internal combustion engines are phased out.
Detroit-based GM said it will make a ""multimillion-dollar investment"" in and help develop Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR) Ltd's Hell's Kitchen geothermal brine project near California's Salton Sea, roughly 160 miles (258 km) southeast of Los Angeles.
""This will supply a sizeable amount of our lithium needs,"" said Tim Grewe, GM's director of electrification strategy. 
The company declined to be more specific on its investment amount, but said the project's lithium will be used to build EVs in the United States and that GM engineers and scientists will visit the site once pandemic-related travel restrictions end.
While other automakers, including China's Great Wall Motor Co and BYD, have invested in lithium producers before, none appear to have taken such an aggressive step to be part of the production process, as GM is taking with CTR.
The move could spark other automakers to follow suit with similar partnerships, especially as demand for the metal is expected to outstrip supply by 20% within four years, according to industry consultant Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. 
The Hell's Kitchen project could be producing 60,000 tonnes of lithium - enough to make roughly 6 million EVs, depending on design - by mid-2024 if all goes as planned, said Rod Colwell, CTR's chief executive. The company expects to obtain federal environmental permits by the end of next year.
That output would make CTR's Hell's Kitchen the largest U.S. producer of the white metal, with production roughly twice as much planned by a rival Nevada project from Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp.
""There's a great window of opportunity here to develop more lithium in the United States,"" Colwell said.
The announcement comes two weeks after GM boosted its electric and autonomous vehicles budget by 75% to $35 billion. 
The geothermal process involves extracting super-hot lithium-rich brine from reservoirs 8,000 feet (2.4 km) underground and using the heat to produce electricity, after which lithium is extracted from the brine.
The brine is then reinjected into the earth, making the process more sustainable than open-pit mines and brine evaporation ponds, the two most-common existing methods to produce the white metal.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc operates geothermal power plants at the Salton Sea and has in the past studied ways to produce lithium there. The Salton area is estimated to contain more than 15 million tonnes of lithium, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
CTR, which received California state funding last year, said its project will emit 15 times less carbon dioxide than lithium mines in Australia, the world's largest producer.
GM is also talking with other U.S. lithium companies for supply, including those who plan to produce the metal from clay, brine and other geological sources, Grewe said. 

The announcement comes the day after U.S. President Joe Biden promoted a video on his Twitter feed featuring U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy driving in a GM-produced electric Chevy Bolt.
GM said there was no connection between the tweet and Friday's announcement.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Friday posted record vehicle deliveries for the second quarter that were in line with Wall Street estimates as the electric-car maker coped with a shortage of chips and relied on sales of its cheaper models.
Tesla weathered the global supply crisis better than legacy automakers, but CEO Elon Musk has warned of challenges of securing chips and raw materials. 
Now eyes are on its second-quarter earnings to see whether recent drops in bitcoin prices would have an adverse effect on Tesla's bottom line, due to Tesla's exposure to the cryptocurrency's volatility.
Tesla delivered 201,250 vehicles in total during the second quarter. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver 200,258 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data.
""It was a solid quarter to volume wise, but I view it as a modest disappointment,"" Garrett Nelson, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, said.
Shares of the company inched up 0.3%, after rising as much as 3.3% in early trading on Friday. 
""Overall, the bulls are breathing a sigh of relief with these delivery numbers,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. 
The deliveries of its Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers, its two lower priced variants, accounted for 99% of its deliveries, offsetting a drop in deliveries of higher-end Model S and X vehicles. 
""Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating through global supply chain and logistics challenges,"" Tesla said. 
Tesla has been raising prices for its vehicles in recent months, which its billionaire boss, Elon Musk, blamed in May on ""major supply chain price pressure"", especially raw materials.
He also said in early June that ""Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it."" 
Brokerage RBC said, ""Worst may be over for Tesla"" for chip shortage, but added that potential margin impact from broad supply chain tightness could persist through the year.
CHINA, MODEL S PLAID
In China, a major growth market for Tesla, the company is facing large-scale recalls, heightened scrutiny from regulators and the public, as well as rising competition from local EV companies. 
""The demand issues were in April around China but clearly rebounded in the month of May and June,"" Ives said. 
Tesla sold 21,936 Model 3 and Model Y cars to Chinese customers in May, rebounding from a sales slump in April, but still well below March numbers. Its China sales for June will be released in the coming days. 
Tesla saw the deliveries of its Model S and X vehicles slip to 1,890 during the April to June period, as a new version of its Model S faced delays before its June launch. 
A Tesla Model S Plaid electric vehicle with a price tag of $129,990, burst into flames on Tuesday while the owner was driving, just three days after the car was delivered. The owner's lawyer called for the model to be grounded. Tesla did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.
BITCOIN 
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) drops in bitcoin prices also could weigh down on Tesla's second-quarter earnings, analysts say.
On Feb. 8, Tesla disclosed its bitcoin investment of $1.5 billion. Its bitcoin holdings helped generate profits in the first quarter, through the sale of 10% of them. 

But the investment is also exposing Tesla stocks to the volatile cryptocurrency prices, which suffered from recent falls. 
""Tesla stock price has been pretty closely correlating with the price of bitcoin,"" Nelson said, adding this hurts investor sentiment despite bitcoin accounting for a small portion of Tesla's overall cash.

1625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>","Summers Says House Prices Are ‘Scary,’ Questions Fed MBS Buying","(Bloomberg) -- Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the surge in U.S. house prices is “scary” and questioned the wisdom of the Federal Reserve continuing to purchase mortgage-backed securities as part of its stimulus campaign.Three days after data showed home prices jumped the most in 30 years in April, Summers told Bloomberg Television’s “Wall Street Week” with David Westin that such gains are inflationary and would likely drive other prices higher.“This is scary,” said Summers, a paid contributor to Bloomberg. “Rising house prices in most people’s common sense of the world represents inflation.”
He predicted property prices would continue to climb given a shortage of supply, but said the inflation risk “needs to be taken very, very seriously.”The Fed buys $40 billion of MBS each month as part of an asset-purchase program designed to help the economy heal from Covid-19 by keeping borrowing costs super-low. Some officials at the central bank have begun suggesting slowing such buying first when they begin to scale back their overall quantitative easing program.
“I cannot understand why the Federal Reserve, in the face of this, continues to be every month a major buyer of mortgage backed securities,” said Summers “That is the ultimate in pro-cyclical behavior.”Nationally, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values climbed 14.9% from a year earlier, according to a statement Tuesday, the biggest gain in data going back to 1988. That came after a revised 13.4% increase in March.
‘Most Vulnerable’
Summers said he was also concerned about valuations in equity markets and that they may reflect those investors with pessimistic outlooks being wrong-footed by past gains and so reluctant to keep betting against the bulls.“It’s precisely when all the pessimism has been beaten out of the system that markets are most vulnerable,” he said. “I see that as a concern right now with our markets.”
Many who have seen stocks soar since the financial crisis of 2008 have “learned the lesson that trees grow to the sky, and I think I’ve learned the lesson that trees are too tall to be stable,” he said. “That makes me nervous.”

And because the industry is expected to grow and generate substantial profits this year and beyond, quality stocks in this space could be good bets now. However, because large-cap software stocks might have limited upside from their current price levels, we believe small-cap players  Progress Software  (NASDAQ:PRGS), QAD (NASDAQ:QADA), and Absolute Software (ABST) could be better picks now. Let’s discuss.The growing use of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), and increased IT spending to adopt these technologies to serve a bigger market efficiently, have been driving the growth of the business software and services industry. The rising utilization of cloud-based platforms has sparked demand for cloud-based software solutions and services from small- and medium-sized businesses. Also, the increasing use of sophisticated technologies, such as block chain, hybrid architecture and machine learning, are expected to contribute to the software industry’s growth. The software industry is expected to hit $9.29 billion between 2021 - 2025, growing at a CAGR of almost 3%.
While the large-cap players in the software space have grown significantly, capitalizing on the industry tailwinds, and their shares are trading at lofty valuations, small- and medium-sized companies still have plenty of room to grow. In fact, the Fed's decision to hold benchmark interest rates low has been benefiting small- and medium-sized enterprises by giving them more capacity to borrow and grow their operations.

However, inflation remains a threat especially with more fiscal stimulus a possibility. Taylor Dart identifies 3 gold miners to buy on the dip: Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL), Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI), and Iamgold (IAG (LON:ICAG)).Investors in the gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) trade just endured one of their worst months in years for the more volatile Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)), with the ETF plunging by 13.8% in June, its worst performance since 2016. While this sharp correction in the ETF led to a loss of momentum for the bulls and has led to a few 52-week lows across the sector, it has also opened up a new buying opportunity for investors. This is because many mid-cap gold producers are now sporting double-digit free cash flow yields, and some are paying dividends as high as 2.0%. In the previous decade, it’s been hard to a 1.0% dividend yield in the sector that looked secure. However, we’ve seen a change of character in this cycle, with multiple dividend raises, while maintaining low payout ratios and still spending heavily on exploration & growth. This suggests that investors in the sector should enjoy significant value being returned to shareholders over the next three years as long as the gold price remains above $1,650/oz, with room for buybacks, additional raises, and growth financed without any dilution. Let’s take a look at a few of the better names worth putting on one’s shopping list:
(Source: Author’s Chart)
Kirkland Lake Gold (KL), Gold Fields (GFI), and Iamgold (IAG) have all been punished by the market over the past several weeks. The sharp correction has been spurred by downgrades to earnings estimates as the gold price has tumbled lower, with the average realized gold price in 2021 likely to average below $1,900/oz given its volatile H1 performance. While this might appear disappointing to most investors, it’s important to note that most miners reported an average sales price of $1,770/oz in 2020, and most are enjoying 40% plus margins at current prices. This suggests that while the correction has weighed on margins, these miners are still in one of the best price environments in history. Despite this, they’re valued synonymously with a commodity trading in a bear market. Let’s take a closer look below:

If this trend continues, investors should expect the following ETFs to outperform: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), and ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK).The stock market has been quite strong over the past few weeks, as it’s managed to break out of its multi-month consolidation. One interesting change in character has been the outperformance in tech stocks since mid-May.
Since May 13, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up by 11.5%, while the S&P 500 is up 5.3% over the same period. Of course, this follows many months of underperformance in tech stocks. Some of the catalysts for this change in behavior are that the last two earnings seasons have been quite strong for tech. Additionally, longer-term rates have also backed off which was one of the major catalysts for the rotation from growth to value. 
There’s a vigorous debate about whether tech stocks are going to continue outperforming or whether value and cyclical stocks will lead the market higher as they did from November to May. Tech bulls will point to softening economic data, deceleration in leading indicators of inflation, and favorable valuations for the sector. If tech continues to outperform, then investors should consider buying the following ETFs: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), and ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK).

However, given the growth prospects of Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), and Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL), their stocks still look undervalued at their current price levels. So, we think it could be wise to add these stocks to one’s portfolio pronto. Read on.While growth stocks handily dominated the market last year, value stocks came into focus in the first half of this year. Investors’ interest in value stocks is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) and Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF’s (VTV) 15.8% and 16.3% returns, respectively, so far this year.
With jobless claims falling to a new pandemic low, the U.S. economy is on a solid path to recovery. And this has been driving major stock market indexes to new highs, making it difficult to find true value names in the market. That’s because the prices of most stocks have by now far outstripped their intrinsic value. However, there are still some quality stocks in the market that are trading at lower valuations.
Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (LL) are examples. They possess solid growth prospects, but their stocks are trading at discounts to their peers. So, we think there could be upside left in these stocks.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 01:06PM ET</span>","Exclusive-EU's planned digital levy to cover hundreds of firms, Vestager says","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A digital levy to be proposed by the European Commission in the coming weeks to fund its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will apply to hundreds of companies, the majority of them European, its executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager said.
In a bid to fire up growth and foster a greener and more digital economy, the 27 European Union countries last year agreed to jointly borrow 750 billion euros ($887 billion) for a post-pandemic recovery fund.
The borrowing, by the European Commission on behalf of EU countries, is to be repaid over 30 years from new taxes, among them levies on the digital economy and on CO2 emissions.
Vestager welcomed the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreement clinched on Thursday on new rules on where companies are taxed and a tax rate of at least 15% but she said the EU would proceed with its digital levy - although she did not say how much the levy would be.
""If we can get this fully endorsed and implemented and tax authorities have the resources actually to claim the taxes, well, then some of the companies which pay very little or nothing in taxes today, they will contribute in the societies where they do their business,"" she told Reuters.
She said the EU digital levy had different objectives to the OECD tax deal and the scope of the levy was ""so much wider, just as a matter of principle it is a levy, it is not a tax.""
""Where the OECD agreement is for the 100 biggest companies, this is for many, many more companies,"" she said, adding that the levy would mostly affect European firms but others would also be affected.
""I do appreciate that for a company, no matter what you call it, it's a cost,"" she said, adding that companies should see it as a normal cost of doing business in Europe.

She declined to provide details on which companies would be affected or the size of the levy. The Commission has rescheduled the tentative date for the announcement to July 20 from July 14, which may still change, a Commission source said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) is confident the integration of its $27 billion deal for Refinitiv, a data and analytics company, will pay off for the bourse despite recent challenges, Chief Executive David Schwimmer said on Friday.
""We're in a strong financial position,"" Schwimmer told an online investor event. ""We remain confident in achieving financial targets that we set out when we announced the transaction.""
So far ""run rate"" savings of 40 million pounds ($55 million) have been made as integration progresses, and debt has been cut by 4 billion pounds, he said.
The LSE's acquisition of Refinitiv turned the exchange into the second largest financial data company after Bloomberg LP.
In March LSE shares tumbled from around 9,300 pence to just over 8,000 pence as details emerged of costs for upgrading the Refinitiv platform. The stock was trading at 7,888 pence on Friday, up 0.1%, having pared gains slightly since the investor event began.
Refinitiv's flagship terminals have been hit by several outages, which Schwimmer said were not due to the underlying product.
""These kinds of issues, outages, are absolutely unacceptable to our customers, unacceptable to us. We know how to address them, and we are very much doing that,"" Schwimmer said.
LSEG was continuing an investment programme in Refinitiv and its terminals begun by its previous owner, U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Schwimmer said. 
The terminals are used by traders and investors to access data and market-moving news.
""We have a high level of confidence that we will deliver revenue growth across data and analytics of 4-6% per annum over the medium term,"" Schwimmer said.
The exchange said in April it was on track to achieve 25% of an announced 350 million pound savings target by the end of 2021, with guidance on 850 million pounds in capital expenditure and 150 million pounds in operational costs for 2021 also unchanged.
""This business has momentum,"" said Andrea Remyn Stone, the former Bloomberg executive who became LSEG's Group Head of Data & Analytics on Thursday, replacing David Craig, former Refinitiv CEO.
REUTERS TALKS
Schwimmer said the LSE was still in discussions with Reuters News over the two groups' agreement to distribute news content, following a dispute earlier this year over whether Reuters News could put up a paywall on its website.
Reuters News is paid about $325 million a year by the LSE for news under a deal agreed with Refinitiv before it was taken over by the exchange.
""We have a good ongoing relationship and good ongoingdiscussion with Reuters,"" Schwimmer said, declining to comment further.
Stone said news is ""essential"" to its business proposition and it views the relationship with Reuters as ""core"". She added that LSE Group uses Reuters in every product it has.
A spokesperson for Reuters News had no immediate comment on the talks. 

 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE following the Refinitiv deal.
Costs and capital expenditure will be updated next month when the exchange reports results.

Investing.com – Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 1.5% during Friday’s session as the antitrust regulator decided to press charges alleging the company had monopolized the market for semiconductor components.
It ordered “the semiconductor supplier to cease its anticompetitive conduct.""
Under a consent order that would settle the Commission’s charges, the regulator asked the company to “stop requiring its customers to source components from Broadcom on an exclusive or near exclusive basis”.
As per FTC’s complaint, Broadcom is a monopolist in the sale of three types of semiconductor components, or chips, used in devices that deliver TV and broadband services. These chips are the core circuitry that run traditional TV broadcast set top boxes, as well as DSL and fiber broadband devices.
Broadcom is also one of the few significant suppliers of five related types of chips. These chips include the core circuitry for streaming set top boxes and cable broadband devices, along with Wi-Fi chips and “front-end” chips for both set top boxes and broadband devices. Front-end chips convert incoming analog signals to digital signals.
Broadcom’s direct customers are original equipment manufacturers which use its components to build STBs and broadband devices.
OEMs supply these devices to TV and broadband service providers—such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Charter, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), DISH and Verizon—which in turn provide devices to consumers in connection with their subscription TV or internet services.
Because Broadcom supplies the core components for devices used by service providers, both OEMs and downstream service providers play important roles in the selection of components used in STBs and broadband devices, the complainant argued.
The complaint alleges that Broadcom illegally maintained its power in the three monopolized markets by entering long-term agreements with both OEMs and service providers that prevented these customers from purchasing chips from Broadcom’s competitors."

(Reuters) - Colombia's markets slid on Friday but then recovered by late morning in volatile trading, a day after Fitch became the second major credit rating agency to downgrade the country's credit rating to 'junk'.
Investors expected the rating downgrade after a tax reform failed in Congress, leading to social unrest and costing the finance minister his job.
""Given the delay in the passage of reform the downgrade was expected by the market,"" said Shamaila Khan, head of EM debt strategies at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) in New York. ""Though there may be some forced short term selling, it is mostly priced in."" 
The move from Fitch follows the loss of investment grade category at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) in May. The country is now rated 'junk' by two of the world's top three rating agencies, potentially forcing some holders out of Colombian debt.
Five-year credit default swaps hit their highest since late May at 143 bps but paired back to 138 bps, up 1 bp on the day, while the Colombian peso softened as much as 0.6% to a two-month low before turning slightly positive, up less than 0.1%.
The local stock market fell as much as 1% in early trade but bounced back to a session high gain of 0.7%.
The premium demanded by investors to hold Colombia's debt over safe haven U.S. Treasuries hit its highest since early October 2020 and was last up 3 basis points (bps) at 253 bps. 

With rising fiscal, political and social risk premiums, and a worsening inflation outlook, Colombia's central bank’s ""degrees of freedom to preserve a high level of monetary accommodation have narrowed considerably,"" said in a note Alberto Ramos, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' chief of economics for Latin America.
A downgrade from Moody's (NYSE:MCO), which still has Colombia two notches into investment grade category, is widely expected.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on shares of credit card companies  American Express  (AXP),  Capital One  (COF), Discover (DFS), and Synchrony (SYF). They are well positioned to capitalize on this trend.Credit card usage and other online payment methods increased significantly over the past year as people increasingly relied on digital modes of payment necessitated by their remote lifestyles. But with the fast-paced economic recovery this year—aided by rapid coronavirus vaccinations—spending on services and discretionary items has increased significantly. According to the Commerce Department, overall consumer spending remained flat in May because a $71.5 billion decrease in spending for goods was balanced by a $74.3 billion jump in spending on services.
Furthermore, according to The Conference Board, the consumer confidence index stood at 127.3 points in June, up from 120 points in May. Strong consumer confidence is expected to translate into more spending, implying a greater use of credit cards. Accelerating technological innovation and rapid adoption of digital prepaid card services could also drive the growth of the credit card market in the coming months. According to Research and Markets, the global credit card market is expected to grow at a 3% CAGR to hit $103.06 billion in 2021.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on shares of established credit card companies American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) because they companies are well positioned to capitalize on increasing consumer spending.

But while most cannabis operators are well positioned to take advantage of the growing domestic and international marijuana market, some companies seem to have lost steam due to stiff industry competition.

(Reuters) -GSK on Friday rejected Elliott's demands that the British company change its board and sell its consumer healthcare arm after separating it from its pharma business, a day after strongly worded proposals from the activist investor.
""The Board strongly believes Emma Walmsley is the right leader of New GSK and fully supports the actions being taken by her and the management team,"" GSK said, referring to the core pharmaceuticals and vaccine business. 
It added that support for GSK's strategy and leadership was shown in talks with its largest shareholders.
In a letter to GSK's board, Elliott on Thursday said GSK should review its leadership and consider a sale of its consumer healthcare business as it confirmed it had taken a significant stake in the group.
Elliott demanded that directors with ""more biopharmaceuticals and scientific experience"" be added to GSK's board before the planned break-up of the company next year. That new board should then decide the best executive leadership, it added.
GSK said governance had already been strengthened with the appointments of former Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) executive Charles Bancroft and Anne Beal, an entrepreneur, health policy expert and paediatrician, as non-executive directors in May 2020 and May 2021 respectively. 
It added that more biopharmaceutical expertise was on its way with further appointments, noting this had been flagged previously.
Elliott declined to comment on GSK's detailed response on Friday. 
EVOLUTION
The London-listed company on June 23 laid out plans to spin off its consumer healthcare arm into a separately listed company, in a move that would deliver an 8 billion pound ($11 billion) special dividend for its underperforming drugs business.
""The demerger structure reflects feedback from a significant proportion of GSK's shareholders that they wish to own Consumer Healthcare as a new listed entity,"" GSK wrote on Friday in defence of the plan.
Elliott had urged GSK to look at a full sale of the consumer health business, which is a joint venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), should the opportunity arise.
""Even in the absence of a CHC (consumer healthcare) trade sale or any other material actionable proposals, we expect Elliott's involvement to translate into positive near-term share price evolution,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.
GSK shares were up 0.1% at 1518 GMT after gaining 1.3% on Thursday. The stock is up about 7% so far this year.
Walmsley, CEO since 2017, has made sweeping leadership changes in a bid to boost the drug development success rate, where the group had fallen behind peers, and improve the commercial performance of its sales force. 
Yet, she has acknowledged that the stock continues to underperform against industry benchmarks.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on its website that Didi was not allowed to register new users during its investigation, which was announced just two days after Didi began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Beijing-based Didi said in a statement to Reuters that it planned to conduct a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and would cooperate fully with the relevant government authority. 
In a filing, it said that apart from the suspension of new user registrations in China, it was operating normally.
Chinese internet regulators have tightened rules for the country's tech giants in recent years, asking companies to collect, store and handle key data properly.
The cyberspace agency did not offer details about its investigation into Didi, but said the investigation was also to prevent data security-related risks, citing China's national security law and cybersecurity law. 
Didi, which offers a wide range of services in China and over 15 international markets, gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data everyday. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis.
Didi laid out related regulations in China in its IPO prospectus and said ""we follow strict procedures in collecting, transmitting, storing and using user data pursuant to our data security and privacy policies.""
Two investors, however, told Reuters that company executives did not discuss possible cybersecurity regulation with investors at the call they joined for Didi's IPO roadshow. 
Didi's shares fell as much as 10.9% after the open and were down 7% at 1335 GMT.
""Didi does seem to be attracting a lot of regulatory pressure. The near-term impact depends a lot on how long a review lasts but Didi has a large enough base that we aren't going to change our forecasts yet,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters. 
Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said while it was hard to know what was going on without more detail, ""CAC has been looking at security of all large firms' data as part of a crackdown on big tech"".
Didi, which raised $4.4 billion from its initial public offering (IPO), did not hold a celebration event for its market debut, an unusual move among Chinese companies.
Didi, founded by Will Cheng in 2012, has faced several regulatory probes in China over safety and its operation licence.
The company is also facing an antitrust investigation, revealed by Reuters in June, looking at whether Didi used anti-competitive behaviours to drive out smaller rivals. It said at the time that it would not comment on ""unsubstantiated speculation from unnamed source(s)"". 
Didi's debut on Wednesday was the biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese company since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014. 

Didi had aimed to raise up to $10 billion through its IPO to value the company at $100 billion. However, investors were critical of the valuation target during meetings ahead of the deal's launch which pushed its size down.
Didi is also backed by technology investment giants including SoftBank Group, Alibaba, Tencent and Uber (NYSE:UBER).

Investing.com –  IBM  stock (NYSE:IBM) fell more than 4% amid top leadership changes that include President Jim Whitehurst’s decision to leave.
Whitehurst had played a pivotal role in the integration of Red Hat with the more than 90-year-old company.
He will now work as senior advisor to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and the rest of the executive leadership team.       
Bridget van Kralingen will step down as senior vice president, global markets, a role she decided to stay in to help in transition when Krishna took over as CEO in April 2020.

Rob Thomas will take Kralingen’s place as senior vice president, global markets. Thomas has led various parts of IBM’s business such as data and AI, hardware, services, and software. According to an IBM note, he will play a key role as the company’s “new go-to-market strategy kicks into high gear.""

In March, the shares slumped after investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed its short position on the stock, saying Lordstown had misled consumers and investors about its pre-orders worth $1.4 billion for its Endurance truck. 

Following the accusations, Lordstown Motors's chief executive and finance head quit suddenly, days after the company had warned it may not have enough money to stay in business over the next year.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>",France's Lagardere exposed to takeovers as heir's grip weakens - sources,"By Sarah White and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) -The heir to France's Lagardere group has ended up with a smaller than advertised stake after a restructuring, further shrinking his sway after he gave up veto powers that protected the firm and its influential media assets from takeovers. 
Arnaud Lagardere effectively holds 11% of the conglomerate, not the 14% allotted on paper to his holding company when a previous partnership structure was finally disbanded this week, according to two sources close to the matter and corporate statements.
Lagardere shares closed up 6% at 22.40 euros, accelerating their gains after Reuters disclosed the stake size, traders said. Lagardere was the top riser on the SBF 120 index. 
Less than a year out from a French presidential election, Lagardere's overhaul has made it more vulnerable to a possible takeover that would change France's media landscape, with Paris Match magazine, a radio station and a Sunday newspaper among some of its prized assets.
The previously unreported smaller stake does not alter the votes Chairman and Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere gets in the boardroom.
But it is another sign of his weakened hand. Under pressure from personal debts and an activist campaign last year, Lagardere sought allies, eventually bringing on board two of France's richest businessmen and dealmakers, media tycoon Vincent Bollore and luxury goods billionaire Bernard Arnault, who are now investors with board seats.
""In the end, Arnaud Lagardere negotiated to keep his status more than the economic equation,"" one of the sources close to the matter said.
While Arnaud Lagardere previously only held 7% of the company, that stake had special powers attached to it which allowed him to block decisions. 
Unravelling that structure as the new investors pushed for more influence gave his holding company the right to double its stake to 14%, but some of those shares are effectively owed to Bernard Arnault, corporate statements show. 
The two sources confirmed that Arnault, who already has 7%, is entitled to at least another 3% of Lagardere as part of the firm's conversion into a joint-stock company, and could claim more shares should he want to cash out of the holding. 
The businessman, who runs luxury goods giant LVMH, insisted the Lagardere group mention that entitlement in recent corporate filings, the people added, after becoming disgruntled with how the company's restructuring turned out. 
A spokesperson for Arnault's Financiere Agache investment vehicle declined to comment. 
Bollore and his Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) group emerged as the big winners of Lagardere's overhaul, with a 27% stake and influence at board level. 
Three investor and banking sources said that Vivendi was a prime contender to launch a full takeover, especially if other interested parties emerged, and despite fears in French President Emmanuel Macron's administration about that scenario.
Macron has concerns that Bollore, who is already building bridges between some of Lagardere's outlets like Europe 1 radio and his CNews TV station, could create a powerful conservative media group that would inundate the airwaves with right-wing views, sources have previously told Reuters. 
Spokespeople for Bollore and Lagardere declined to comment.
Macron's office could not immediately be reached but has previously declined to comment on the matter. 
VIVENDI A THREAT?
Bollore has also had an eye on Lagardere's publishing assets, which include Hachette, sources said last year. 
Arnaud Lagardere has so far welcomed the new company set-up, however, saying it would help keep the group intact and centred on developing its core travel retail and publishing activities. 
""Vivendi and Vincent Bollore are assets for us and not a threat,"" Lagardere told a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. 

The 60-year-old was elected for another six-year term on the board, another trade-off for giving up the partnership structure at the once-mighty industrial firm founded by his father.
Some of Arnaud Lagardere's shares in the Lagardere group are also collateral for a loan he had taken out with Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) bank, corporate filings show. A source close to Arnaud Lagardere said that debt, originally 164 million euros, was under control. It is not clear how much is outstanding. Credit Agricole declined to comment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's tech chief Margrethe Vestager on Friday warned iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) against using privacy and security concerns to fend off competition on its App Store, reasons CEO Tim Cook gave for not allowing users to install software from outside the Store.
Vestager, who is also the European Commission's executive vice president, last year proposed rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that would force Apple to open up its lucrative App Store so that users can download apps from the internet or third-party app stores in a practice known as side-loading.
Cook, speaking at an event last month, said the proposal would destroy the security and privacy of iPhones.
Vestager said she shares Cook's security concerns.
""I think privacy and security is of paramount importance to everyone,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.
""The important thing here is, of course, that it's not a shield against competition, because I think customers will not give up neither security nor privacy if they use another app store or if they sideload,"" she said.
Vestager indicated that she was open to changes in her proposal, which needs input from EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.
""I think that it is possible to find solutions to this,"" she said.
Vestager also said Apple's privacy changes, unlike Google's plan to block a popular web tracking tool called ""cookies"" which formed part of her investigation into the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit's digital advertising business opened last month, were not in her crosshairs for now. 
Apple rolled out an update of its iOS operating system in April with new privacy controls designed to limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users.

""As I have said, I think actually several times, that it is a good thing when providers give us the service that we can easily set our preferences if we want to be tracked outside the use of an app or not as long as it's the same condition for everyone. So far, we have no reason to believe that this is not the case for Apple,"" she said.
Apple did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

(Reuters) - A federal judge said Google must face much of a lawsuit accusing the company of illegally recording and disseminating private conversations of people who accidentally trigger its voice-activated Voice Assistant on their smartphones.
In a Thursday night decision, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman let plaintiffs in the proposed class action pursue claims that Google and its parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc violated California privacy laws, some claims that they violated federal privacy laws, and some breach of contract claims.
The San Jose, California-based judge also dismissed the plaintiffs' California consumer protection claims, but said they could be refiled.
Google Assistant is designed to react when mobile device owners use ""hot words"" such as ""Hey Google"" or ""Okay Google,"" similar to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Siri.
But the plaintiffs said Google had no right to use their conversations for targeted advertising when Google Assistant misperceived what they said as hot words, known as ""false accepts.""
In a 37-page decision, Freeman said the plaintiffs showed they used Google Assistant-enabled devices often enough to have had a reasonable expectation of privacy when speaking.
She added that while Google disclosed in its privacy policy how it collects information for targeted advertising, ""it does not sufficiently apprise users that it will use recordings made in the absence of manual activation or a hot word utterance.""
In seeking a dismissal, Google said the plaintiffs failed to show they were harmed, or that it broke any contractual guarantees. ""Google never promises that the Assistant will activate only when plaintiffs intend it to,"" it said.
The proposed class seeking unspecified damages includes U.S. purchasers of Google Assistant-enabled devices since May 18, 2016.

Google and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. The plaintiffs' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

Home to the world’s largest internet population, China’s internet users could hit 1 billion by next year, according to a report by Insider Intelligence.

Recovering dine-in traffic, elevated digital sales, new product launches and other improvements are contributing to Chipotle’s competitive momentum, according to Geiger.

The company’s expanding footprint and unique omni-channel platform have established it as the nation’s largest regional gaming operator. However, given that its expansion plans could face bumps in the road in the coming months, can the stock rebound? Let’s find out.
Penn National Gaming, Inc., (PENN) is a Wyomissing, Penn.-based gaming and live sports betting properties operator. It holds ownership interests in 41 gaming and racing properties across 19 states. Although COVID-19 related store closures and restrictions impacted the company’s land-based gaming properties last year, with nearly half the U.S. population now fully vaccinated, visitation and length of play has improved significantly across all its segments. PENN’s stock has gained 146.9% over the past year on strong revenues from the online Barstool Sportsbook and iCasino platforms.
However, its share price has tumbled 29% over the past three months and 11.6% year-to-date. The stock is now trading 46.2% below its 52-week high of $142, which it hit on March 15. 
While PENN has successfully launched its online Barstool Sportsbook in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana, the company’s expansion plans could hit a hurdle given that sports betting is still not legal in many states. Furthermore, PENN’s stock is currently trading lower than its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $82.12 and $87.95, respectively, indicating a downtrend.

The transaction price of $47,800 for each Ford vehicle was up 15.5% or $6,400 from over a year ago.
Ford sales of electrified vehicles expanded 117% in June, capping off a new first-half record of 56,570 vehicles.
The company said reservations for its electric F-150 Lightning, which the company started taking in May, have topped 100,000. The pickup is due to be on the road next year.
With just 11 days to turn, Ford said “Mustang Mach-E is essentially selling as soon as it arrives at dealers.” The company has sold 12,975 Mustang Mach-Es through the first half of the year.

1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",Didi Tumbles on China Cybersecurity Review 2 Days After IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Didi Global Inc. tumbled Friday after China said it’s starting a cybersecurity review of the ride-hailing company just two days after it pulled off one of the biggest U.S. stock market debuts of the past decade.
The move is to prevent data security risks, safeguard national security and protect public interest, according to a statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China. Didi, which only started trading on Wednesday in New York after an initial public offering, fell 8.8% to $14.95 as the market opened.
The surprise probe by China’s internet regulator piles on the scrutiny of Didi over issues ranging from antitrust to data security. The company has been grappling with a broad antitrust probe into China’s internet firms with uncertain outcomes for Didi and peers like major backer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. More broadly, Beijing has been curbing the growing influence of China’s largest internet corporations, widening an effort to tighten the ownership and handling of troves of information that internet giants from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent and Didi scoop up daily from hundreds of millions of users.
The CAC didn’t specify what it will look into. But the timing of its announcement was significant, coming not just on the heels of Didi’s IPO but also the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary celebrations in Beijing.
“Didi will fully cooperate with the relevant government authority during the review,” the company said in a statement. “We plan to conduct comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and continuously improve on our cybersecurity systems and technology capacities”
Founded in 2012 by Cheng Wei, Didi managed to force a retreat of its U.S. rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. in 2016 and embarked on an ambitious international expansion. Its U.S. IPO was highly anticipated and marked the second-biggest debut by a Chinese company, trailing only Alibaba.
Didi has faced regulatory scrutiny ever since a pair of murders in 2018 that Cheng has called its “darkest days.” The Beijing-based firm responded to the subsequent crackdown with a fusillade of efforts to improve security across its network of half a billion. It began to explore new businesses to offset slowing ride-hailing growth, from car repairs to grocery delivery. That served it well during the coronavirus pandemic, when whole cities came to a standstill. The company delivered an $837 million profit in the March quarter -- a rarity among recent high-profile IPOs.
The company, which was among 34 internet giants ordered by regulators in April to correct ‘excesses,’ warned in a regulatory filing that it couldn’t assure investors that government officials would be satisfied with its efforts or that it would escape penalties.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 10:17AM ET</span>","Brazil sees dealmaking boom led by energy, retail, healthcare","By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian companies are striking mammoth share offerings and M&A deals, as Latin America's biggest economy recovers from the COVID pandemic with expected full-year GDP growth of 5%, potentially further lifting sectors from energy to healthcare.
M&A volume grew eightfold in the first half of 2021 from the same period a year earlier, to $56.8 billion, while share offerings totaled $15.3 billion, up 55%.
Bankers expect activity to remain buoyant during the second half, boosted by an optimistic economic outlook, with sectors such as retail and fintechs in the spotlight.
In the first half, healthcare operator Hapvida's $9.58 billion acquisition of Notre Dame Intermedica was the seventh largest deal in emerging markets, while state-controlled oil company Petrobras' $6.45 billion acquisition of deepwater oil fields Atapu and Sepia fields ranked thirteenth.
The privatization of Rio de Janeiro state water and sewage utility Cedae raised roughly $4 billion, luring Singapore's GIC, Canadian pension fund CPPIB and local holding company Itausa.
""There is a virtuous circle in place for deals: economic activity is picking up, benchmark interest rates are low and money is available,"" said Eduardo Miras, Brazil head of investment banking at Citi. 
Brazil's largest share offering this year happened on the last day of June, with the sale of Petrobras' stake in fuel distributor Petrobras Distribuidora SA. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the seller is formally known, raised 11.36 billion reais ($2.3 billion). 
Companies such as energy firm Raizen, a joint venture between  Cosan  (NYSE:CZZ) SA and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, cement maker Intercement Brasil SA and oncology clinics chain Oncoclinicas plan to price multibillion-real IPOs in the coming weeks.
These deals are expected to lure deep-pocketed foreign investors, who shunned Brazilian share offerings earlier this year amid snowballing pandemic and political turmoil, taking the place of domestic investors who have grown more cautious. 
""Foreign investors are no longer as worried about the pandemic as the pace of vaccination has picked up over the last few weeks,"" said Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Itau BBA, which led the equities league table in the first half. He predicted share offerings will reach 160 billion reais this year, a 33% rise from 2020.
Foreign investors spent 65.1 million reais buying Brazilian companies' shares, net of outflows, in the first semester, according to stock exchange operator B3, compared with a net outflow of 62.8 billion reais in the year-ago period.
Still, domestic investors have grown more timid, as benchmark interest rates have risen to 4.25% from 2% in January. Equity funds have gotten 1.7 billion reais in net new money this year through May, dwarfed by net inflows of 94.1 billion reais for fixed income funds.
DEALS CYCLE
Strong capital markets activity is also increasing funds available for acquisitions, said Bruno Amaral, head of M&A at Banco BTG Pactual, which led the Brazil M&A league table in the first half.
Hard hit industries during the pandemic such as retail have been among the most active in deals in recent months as Brazil recovers and consumption rises, Amaral said. 
""We are also seeing a lot of deals in the financial area, mainly fintechs taking on the large banks, and in healthcare,"" he added.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc led a $750 million funding round in fast-growing fintech Nubank, while private equity firm Advent International invested $430 million in payments company Ebanx.

The company posted a 117% rise in U.S. electric and hybrid vehicle sales for June. Ford-branded SUV sales rose 37% in June while its Lincoln SUV sales increased 23.3%.
Ford sold 12,975 units of its Mustang Mach-E SUV in the first six months of this year. The company is poised to launch the electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup in 2022. 
Automakers in the United States are benefiting from strong demand as consumers opt for personal transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. Low interest rates and government stimulus are also helping drive sales.
However, supply has been constrained due to a global semiconductor shortage.

""With constrained inventories and record turn rates in the second quarter, we have been working closely with our dealers gathering retail orders, which are up 16-fold over last year,"" Ford said in a statement.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 10:02AM ET</span>",Test and space: Barcelona telecoms bash lifts 'hybrid' trade fair hopes,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Clara-Laeila Laudette
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Its biggest act may have been beamed in on a screen, but a smaller, quieter 'hybrid' Mobile World Congress (MWC) has given others hope that in-person events can succeed in a pandemic.
For those who did make it to Barcelona, there were no boozy parties, with far fewer such gatherings than in previous years and the only alcohol on offer reserved for hand sanitising.
The must-haves at this week's MWC were a negative COVID-19 test, an FFP2 face mask and a digital contact-tracing badge for the 30,000 or so who filed through its testing stations and followed a one-way traffic system to reduce infection risk.
At every booth an army of volunteers religiously scanned contact tracing passes, while others were on hand at every corner reminding visitors who were not maintaining enough distance or whose face mask had slipped to follow the rules.
The events industry, which includes conferences and performances and was valued at $1.14 trillion in 2019 by Allied Market Research, was stopped in its tracks by the pandemic. 
While some business shifted online, industry participants have been working on ways to get back to normal.
One show waiting to see whether MWC succeeded in minimising the spread of COVID-19 is Europe's biggest tech conference, Web Summit, which is pushing ahead with preparations for an in-person show in November in Lisbon.
""We're excited to see people attending tech gatherings ... MWC was the first to return in person, that's never easy,"" Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave told Reuters, adding that firms would now be more interested in attending such events.
Both the limitations and appeal of a hybrid model were highlighted by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's keynote speech on his $30 billion Starlink venture, which despite being delivered by webcam generated MWC's biggest audience buzz.
Its organisers had billed the Barcelona show as a step towards normality ahead of its next edition in February 2022 and most attendees lauded its return despite its reduced scale and the absence of household names such as Ericsson (BS:ERICAs),  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK). ""COVID-19 challenged us. We've had to develop new health and safety protocols and a hybrid platform, but we did it,"" said Mats Granryd, director general of telecoms industry association GSMA, which took big losses after cancelling last year's MWC.
The show still recorded an undisclosed number of positive cases.
""Individuals who tested positive were identified prior to entering the venue... we confirm they've been under the care health authorities and the situation remains under control,"" a GSMA spokeswoman said.
Catalonia's health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The regional top health official has warned this week of an uptick in infections, mainly among young people, tied to the spread of the Delta variant.
Although several big exhibitors such as Huawei cut their physical presence and overall footfall was less than a third of previous years, attendees in Barcelona welcomed being able to revive old relationships or make new ones. 
""We've had interesting discussions, though they've had a different, graver tone this year. But the most important thing was to do it... to show that there is life after, or despite, COVID,"" Orange CEO Stephane Richard told Reuters.
STARTUP SPACE Another contrast was the hallways of MWC's three pavilions, compared to 10 in the Fira fair ground in 2019, emptied as the week progressed, leaving it mostly deserted by Wednesday night, when most exhibitors threw their wrap-up parties.
And the absence of some big names also shook up the pecking order of exhibitors, with the vacuum partly filled by smaller startups and hard-to-pigeonhole companies such as TelcoDR. 
Its founder Danielle Royston scooped up Ericsson's exhibition stand and created one of the most-visited booths by booking U.S. rockers Bon Jovi and offering thirty-odd startups space to showcase their products.
By sharing a congested space in the MWC's startup arena, newcomers attracted more visitors than some of the big stands.
Lower booth and ticket prices also helped startups, Consuelo Naranjo, marketing director of Austria's Authentic Vision, said, adding: ""We just had a meeting with a spokesperson of a small Italian village, whom we would not have met otherwise.""

Even old hands such as Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) noticed the effect of a more diverse crowd.
""It's true that (MWC) lost that 'Wow!' factor - but the people who have come are much more networking-focused, and you can dedicate more time to startups, which is positive,"" Andres Escribano, director of Telefonica IoT & Big Data, told Reuters.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 3% in Friday’s trading as both sales and production topped 200,000 units for the first time, breaking records that were set in the first quarter.
Tesla delivered 201,250 units and produced 206,421 units in the second quarter. The deliveries were slightly below expectations.
The electric vehicle maker produced 204,081 units of its Model 3 and Y, its more affordable mid-range cars. The rest 2,340 units were Model S and X vehicles, as per the company filing.
Tesla had delivered 184,800 units and produced 180,338 vehicles in the first quarter.

Stellantis, which already has two battery factory projects in France and Germany, has said that adding gigafactories in Europe and the United States would be decided this year.
The company is holding talks on this with Rome, as Italy is one of its main production hubs in Europe.
Stellantis also expects to announce later this month more stringent targets regarding its CO2 emissions in Europe, said Stellantis' CEO Carlos Tavares on Friday.

Since Stellantis was formed this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, production in Italy has been under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere in Europe, while Stellantis - like many in its sector - is also working on more environmentally-friendly vehicles.
Last month, Stellantis' peer  Renault  (PA:RENA) unveiled a more ambitious strategy for electric vehicles (EVs), betting on new, affordable versions of its iconic small cars of the past to catch up with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in the fast-growing sector.

Major construction work on the merchant cable could start in 2022, said the group of investors led by Meridiam, asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG) Capital Partners, part of German insurer Allianz, and Japan's Kansai Electric Power.
The latest announcement coincided with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London. 
""NeuConnect is the largest UK-German investment project currently underway and will allow our energy grids to share excess power – making sure renewable energy is not wasted and helping both our economies decarbonise more rapidly,"" Johnson said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
By integrating renewable energy sources in Germany and the United Kingdom, the cable could deliver a net reduction in carbon emissions of 16 million tonnes over 25 years, the investors said. 
NeuConnect will link Britain's Isle of Grain in Kent with Wilhemshaven in northern Germany, via a 700-km-long subsea cable and allowing for 1.4 gigawatt (GW) of electricity to flow in either direction. 
In June, UK energy regulator Ofgem confirmed key licence details for the merchant project, while Germany approved necessary energy legislation, paving the way for the construction and operation of independent cross-border interconnectors like NeuConnect.
Another two interconnectors to Britain are currently under construction or in test operations - the North Sea Link cable to Norway and the Viking Link connection to Denmark - and both are owned by the respective national transmission system operators (TSOs).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Electric (OTC:MIELY)'s CEO said he will step down to take responsibility for ""three decades of systematic deceit"" during which the Japanese firm falsified inspection data for air conditioners and brake compressors used in trains.
The admission by Mitsubishi, whose products range from air conditioners and vacuum cleaners to industrial printers and satellites, further dents Japan's reputation for high-quality manufacturing, already tarnished by other cases of companies falsifying or covering up test data. 
""I am shocked by this,"" Takeshi Sugiyama told a news conference, at which he apologised for the falsification and promised to appoint a successor as early as this month once he had helped coordinate the company's response to the problem.
Sugiyama, who became CEO in 2018 and has been with Mitsubishi for more than four decades, said on Friday he regretted not informing shareholders at its annual meeting on June 29.
Mitsubishi management was aware of the air conditioner data problem two weeks before and knew about the air compressor falsifications the day before shareholders met, but chose not to release the information until June 30, he said.
The latest corporate scandal comes amid heightened concern over corporate governance in Japan after an investigation found managers at Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, another well-established conglomerates, had colluded with the trade ministry to pressure foreign shareholders. 
Japan's economy and trade minister, Hiroshi Kajiyama, said earlier that the government would act if it found that Mitsubishi had broken any laws or regulations.
Mitsubishi said the equipment supplied with falsified inspection data posed no safety risk, and although it breached contracts with customers, did not break any laws.
The company said it would release a full report in September, alongside measures to deal with the problem. 

In the 35 years that Mitsubishi falsified inspection data, it supplied 84,600 air conditioning units to 80 rail companies.
It said it shipped 1,500 compressors, used in train brakes and doors, including in Japan's high-speed bullet trains, to 20 mostly domestic companies.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 09:11AM ET</span>",Timeline: H&M's China sales hit as boycott bites,"(Reuters) - Fashion retailer H&M has taken a sales hit in China in recent months, its latest results showed, after consumers there called for boycotts of foreign apparel brands over past comments they made on alleged human rights abuses in the country's western Xinjiang region.
Stockholm-based H&M, which counts China as one of its biggest markets for sales - accounting for 5% of sales last year - and one of its two biggest purchasing sources, has been singled out in particular. The company was wiped from e-commerce platform Tmall and its store locations from mobile phone maps in China, while its app has vanished from local app stores.
Some researchers and foreign lawmakers say Xinjiang authorities use coercive labour programmes to meet seasonal cotton-picking needs, which China strongly denies.
Following are key milestones in the dispute that has hit the Swedish retail giant:
April 2007 - H&M opens its first mainland China store, in Shanghai. By the end of February 2021, it has 502 stores in the country.
2016 - Reports begin to emerge alleging human rights abuses in Xinjiang as authorities there expand a network of internment facilities as part of what they say are efforts to combat religious extremism among Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups.
Aug 10, 2018 - A United Nations human rights panel says it had received credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs are held in what resembles a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"".
Aug 13, 2018 - China rejects the UN panel's allegations but says that some people underwent re-education after being deceived by extremists. 
May 16, 2019 - A Wall Street Journal report names H&M among companies whose supply chains include yarn sourced from Xinjiang. H&M says it would not form any new relationships in the region, the report says.
August, 2020 - The Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an industry sustainability scheme, says it is temporarily suspending licensing in Xinjiang over forced labour concerns. The statement is no longer available online. 
September, 2020 - H&M issues a statement expressing concerns about reports on forced labour, saying it does not work with any factories in Xinjiang, has ensured that its manufacturers do not employ workers from Xinjiang through labour transfer programmes, and no longer sources cotton from the region as it relies on BCI-licensed farms for its Chinese cotton supply, which no longer include producers in Xinjiang. 
March 24, 2021 - Chinese consumers and social-media users, including the Central Communist Youth League, excoriate H&M, accusing it of smearing China and calling for a boycott, after its September 2020 statement resurfaces in social media. On the same day, searches for H&M on Chinese e-commerce platforms are blocked.
It was not clear why the old statement re-emerged on social media, although it came days after a coordinated set of sanctions imposed on China by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States over human rights in Xinjiang.
In response, H&M says that its supply chain policy did not represent any political position, and that it cooperated with more than 350 manufacturers in China.
The ripple spreads to other brands including  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Uniqlo, Hugo Boss and Burberry, but H&M bears the brunt of the criticism. 
March 29 - The Chinese branch of BCI says it has found no evidence of forced labour in Xinjiang.
March 31 - H&M's CEO says that about 20 stores were closed in China. H&M says in a statement that it is dedicated to regaining the confidence of its Chinese consumers.

July 1 - H&M reports a 28% year-on-year drop, or 23% measured in local currencies, in sales in China in the three months through May to 1.6 billion crowns ($189 million). The H&M brand remains off Tmall and Chinese mobile phone makers' app stores, and H&M tells analysts and reporters the situation in China remains ""complex"".

The bank is focusing on repayment issues in some $2.3 billion loans provided by Greensill to three single counterparties, Reuters said. The biggest of them is the $1.2 billion exposure to Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance.
Gupta was reported by the Financial Times on Friday to be in talks with Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) over a possible refinancing of his troubled steel empire.
In March, Credit Suisse’s asset management unit was forced to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the British firm lost credit insurance coverage, something that led to its filing for insolvency shortly afterward. 
Separately on Friday,. the Eurozone's top bank regulator warned that it may impose tighter capital requirements for the leveraged loans business, an area that Credit Suisse is highly active in. While Credit Suisse is regulated by Swiss body Finma rather than the European Central Bank, the ECB's move would put pressure on other regulators in Europe to take similar action

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",Malaysian palm giant IOI to conduct audit after report alleging labour abuse,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian palm oil giant IOI Corp will undergo an audit to assess the compliance of its labour policies and working conditions at its plantations, the firm said on Friday, following a report by a human rights group alleging violations.
Helsinki-based Finnwatch on Wednesday published a report alleging that Indian migrant workers at an IOI estate face poor living conditions, paid high recruitment fees, and were paid below the minimum wage. 
IOI said it viewed the report's findings seriously and would strive to improve the implementation of its labour policies and working conditions.
""Within the next months, IOI will undergo an audit supervised by one of our key customers and assisted by a reputable international labour rights consulting firm,"" it said in an exchange filing. It did not name the customer and the consulting firm. 
The audit will seek to ascertain any non-compliance with its labour policies or unsatisfactory working conditions faced by its 16,000 workers in Malaysia, the company said.
The statement came a week after IOI said it will assist in any investigation after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a letter to an activist that it was investigating the firm over forced labour allegations.
The company denied Finnwatch's accusation of worker's having to pay recruitment fees. It said workers had instead paid ""illegal monies"" in their home country to unknown persons, which is beyond IOI's jurisdiction and should not be considered as such fees. 

IOI highlighted its commitment to make ex-gratia payments to workers who had been charged the fees before introducing a no recruitment fees policy in 2017. It said the 918 workers eligible for the payment had been paid by June. 
It said workers were guaranteed to receive the minimum wage, and had issued a guideline to enable a transparent process for them to verify their working hours and calculate their wages.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, but firmly range-bound as the market awaits the closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded up 2 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
The main equity indices all saw strong gains in the first half of the year as vaccinations allowed the economy to reopen against the backdrop of massive levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
This continued on Thursday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, notching its sixth-straight record close and finishing above 4,300 for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%.
The main focus Friday will be on the nonfarm payrolls release, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the Federal Reserve looking for a significant recovery in the U.S. labor market before considering reining in its ultra-easy monetary policy. 
Expectations at the start of the week were for 700,000 jobs to have been filled last month, up from 559,000 in May. That said, both ADP and weekly initial claims were stronger than expected, so  expectations may have now risen.
In corporate news, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will also be in the spotlight after the drugmaker reported that a new study indicated that its single-shot vaccine offered strong protection against the highly transmissible delta variant of the Covid-19 virus. 
Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) will also be in demand after the space travel company said it will launch founder Richard Branson and a full crew into space by July 11.
Crude oil prices edged lower Friday, but remained at very high levels after a meeting of top producers failed to agree on future production levels. 
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.1% at $75.17 a barrel, after climbing above $75 during the previous session for the first time since 2018, while Brent was down 0.2% at $75.71.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, has reconvened a meeting aimed at deciding the amount of oil to return to the market after the United Arab Emirates blocked a deal at the last minute on Thursday.
The group, known as OPEC+, appeared to have come to a preliminary agreement to boost output by 400,000 barrels a day each month from August to December before the UAE’s dramatic intervention.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock was trading higher during Friday’s premarket trading as findings from a small lab study indicated that the company’s single dose COVID-19 vaccine may be effective against the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
In laboratory testing, the vaccine triggered a strong immune response in blood samples taken from eight vaccinated people, J&J said Thursday. The company released the high-level findings through a press release, not a detailed peer-reviewed study.
After the virus originated in China in 2019 and spread to other countries, it has mutated several times. Delta is a variant that first emerged late last year or early 2021 in India and is now the most prevalent and also the deadliest virus in most countries.
All vaccines in the market including those from J&J,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Gamaleya and Sinovac have been developed based on the original virus.
Vaccines that show a high degree of effectiveness against mutations of the virus - of which many will surely follow - have a batter chance of gaining market share as the world prepares for a long campaign against Covid-19.

LONDON (Reuters) - The median pay of chief executives at Britain's top companies fell for the fourth straight year to 2.85 million pounds ($3.92 million) in 2020, consultants Deloitte said on Friday. 
The drop, from 3.3 million pounds in 2019, came as many bosses took pay and bonus cuts in response to the hit to revenues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and after pressure from investors to rein in remuneration.
Around a third received no bonus in 2020, up from 6% in 2019, while more than half of the CEOs, 55%, will also face a salary freeze for 2021, Deloitte said. 
Following investor pressure, more than 95% of companies had agreed to cut existing executive pensions, with most pledging to align them with the wider workforce by the end of 2022. 
Despite that, the number of companies to face a material rebellion on pay at their annual meeting - considered anything less than 80% support - more than doubled to 12% in 2021, from 5% in the prior year.
""Shareholders were clear at the outset of the pandemic that decisions on executive pay should reflect the wider workforce, investor and societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Deloitte Vice Chair Stephen Cahill.

""While the vast majority have shown restraint, investors remain focussed on pay fairness and will vote against remuneration reports where executives are seen to be insulated from the wider stakeholder impact.""

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse to repay further $750 million to Greensill-linked fund investors,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is paying out a further $750 million to investors in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds, its asset management arm told investors on Friday.
It has recovered some $6.1 billion of the $10 billion in funds backed by insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital, it said on Friday, a slight increase over the $5.9 billion through late May.
The collapse of the funds in March kicked off a tumultuous period for the bank, culminating with a multi-billion dollar loss related to family office Archegos in a raft of executive oustings and an impending overhaul as top management fight to keep the bank intact.
The new repayments, planned for the week of July 5, will bring the total it has paid out to investors in the liquidation proceeds to $5.6 billion.
""Further liquidation proceeds are expected to be paid out to investors as soon as practicable in future installments,"" Credit Suisse said in the note. ""Concrete timing on the next cash payouts cannot be provided at this moment.""
Credit Suisse is focusing on some $2.3 billion in loans provided by Greensill to three single counterparties, the biggest of them Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, which are experiencing repayment issues.
On Friday, it said roughly $2.3 billion in late payments had accumulated as of June 29, approximately $1.8 billion of which were related to so-called ""focus areas"" comprised of these three groups, while a further $500 million was related to single-counterparty exposures.
The group is in deep discussions with mining magnate Gupta over the $1.2 billion exposure its funds hold to his wholly-owned GFG Alliance, representing the fund's single biggest pool of at-risk assets.
In late June, the two groups reached a six-week standstill agreement on GFG'S Australian steel and coal mining assets, which they hope will allow GFG to refinance the operations.
Credit Suisse has also held discussion with Softbank-backed construction startup Katerra over a $440 million exposure, and with West Virginia governor Jim Justice's coal company Bluestone Resources over a $690 million exposure.
Katerra in June filed for insolvency, estimating liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion and assets of $500 million to $1 billion.

On some of these exposures, Credit Suisse expects insurance to kick in if repayments are not made, and the bank is looking to related insurance, primarily from Japanese group Tokio Marine.
Bond and Credit Company (BCC), a Tokio Marine unit, had provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes, indirectly covering some of the Credit Suisse funds as a so-called ""loss payee"".

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>","Robinhood reveals breakneck growth, legal pitfalls in IPO filing","By Anirban Sen and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc on Thursday set the stage for its hotly anticipated IPO as it revealed rapid growth in users of its trading app in a filing, while also flagging a swathe of investigations by prosecutors and regulators.
The company, under scrutiny after this year's trading frenzy for so-called meme stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME), is aiming for an IPO valuation of over $40 billion, Reuters has reported. 
Robinhood's IPO filing detailed for the first time how the trading mania, which has swept amateur investors, fueled a four-fold jump in its revenue over January to March, and also how its quick expansion came at a cost.
It reported a net loss of $1.4 billion for the period after borrowing $3.5 billion via convertible bonds to backstop the wave of trading orders amid the rally in a few stocks, which had been shorted by hedge funds and championed by individual investors in online chatrooms including Reddit's WallStreetBets.
Its handling of the meme stock frenzy, marred with glitches and followed by trading restrictions, attracted the wrath of many of its users and U.S. lawmakers. 
Legal authorities and regulators, that were already looking into Robinhood's aggressive marketing to investors and how it profits off trading orders, doubled down on their scrutiny. 
A probe by the U.S. attorney's office in California even resulted in a search warrant for Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev's cell phone, the IPO filing shows. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern California declined to comment.
Earlier this week, the Menlo Park, California-based company agreed to pay a $70 million fine as part of a settlement with U.S. financial regulators who accused it of failing to vet its customers and implement risk controls. 
Robinhood and CEO Tenev have been subpoenaed and received requests for information from several government bodies, including the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the filing. 
The company was also sued this year by the family of a 20-year-old stock trader who committed suicide, citing the app's ""misleading communications"" that caused their son to panic over what he wrongly believed were huge market losses.
A majority of Robinhood's revenue is derived from ""payment for order flow."" Under this practice, brokers receive a fee from market makers for routing trades to them. 
Critics argue this creates a conflict of interest situation, whereby brokers are incentivized to send orders to whoever pays the most, which might not necessarily be the best deal for customers. Regulators are scrutinizing Robinhood over it.
In the first quarter of this year, 59% of Robinhood's revenue came from four market makers. Its revenue last year rose to $959 million, the company said. 
Robinhood turned profitable in 2020, reporting a net income of $7 million, versus a loss of $107 million in 2019.
The company held about $12 billion in cryptocurrency assets under custody as of March 31, 2021, a 23-fold jump from a year earlier. More than 9.5 million customers traded about $88 billion of cryptocurrency on Robinhood's platform during the same period.
GO-TO APP FOR YOUNG INVESTORS
Founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood's trading app has made it easier for the masses to trade securities and electrified a generation of retail traders. 
The platform's easy-to-use interface allowed it to become a go-to for young investors stuck at home due to the pandemic and its popularity has soared over the past 18 months. 
Arguably the breakout financial technology startup of its generation, Robinhood has captured the imagination of Silicon Valley's biggest investors, who have poured billions of dollars into the company. It challenges age-old rules around investing by dismissing the role of financial advisers.
""Some pundits deride individual stock ownership and say that people should only be investing in passively-managed funds through an adviser. We reject this, and we believe that it's important to be able to own stocks directly in the companies you love, without any middlemen,"" Tenev and Bhatt said in the IPO filing. 
Robinhood said underwriters would reserve between 20% and 35% of its Class A shares for sale to customers through its IPO Access feature, a platform it unveiled in May to give retail investors the opportunity to snap up shares in IPOs.
Robinhood has raised over $5.5 billion from investors since its launch, including Ribbit Capital, ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. 
Its valuation nearly tripled in the last year alone, with a financing in February valuing the company at around $30 billion, according to people familiar with matter.

The online brokerage plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""HOOD"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P.Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>",France probes fashion retailers for concealing 'crimes against humanity' in Xinjiang,"PARIS (Reuters) -French prosecutors have opened an investigation into four fashion retailers suspected of concealing ""crimes against humanity"" in China's Xinjiang region, a judicial source said on Thursday.
The procedure is linked to accusations against China over its treatment of minority Muslim Uyghurs in the region, including the use of forced labour, the source said.
China denies all accusations of abuse in the region.
The source told Reuters Uniqlo France, a unit of Japan's Fast Retailing, Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), France's SMCP and Skechers were the subject of the investigation, confirming a report by French media website Mediapart.
""An investigation has been opened by the crimes against humanity unit within the antiterrorism prosecutor's office following the filing of a complaint,"" the source said.
France has a Central Office to Fight Crimes against Humanity, Genocide and War Crimes, founded in 2013.
Inditex said it rejected the claims in the legal complaint, adding that it conducted rigorous traceability controls and would fully cooperate with the French investigation.
""At Inditex, we have zero tolerance for all forms of forced labour and have established policies and procedures to ensure this practice does not take place in our supply chain,"" the company said in a statement.
SMCP said it would cooperate with the French authorities to prove the allegations false.
""SMCP works with suppliers located all over the world and maintains that it does not have direct suppliers in the region mentioned in the press,"" SMCP said, adding that it regularly audited its suppliers.
Fast Retailing said in a statement from Tokyo that it had not been contacted by French authorities and that none of its production partners are located in Xinjiang.
""If and when notified, we will cooperate fully with the investigation to reaffirm there is no forced labour in our supply chains,"" it said.
The company lost an appeal with United States Customs in May after a shipment of Uniqlo men's shirts were impounded because of suspected violations of a ban on Xinjiang cotton.
Skechers said it does not comment on pending litigation. It referred Reuters to a March 2021 statement in which it said it maintained a strict supplier code of conduct.
Two nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) filed a complaint in France in early April against multinationals for concealment of forced labour and crimes against humanity.
United Nations experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's western Xinjiang region.
Many former inmates have said they were subject to ideological training and abuse. Rights groups say the camps have been used as a source of low-paid and coercive labour.
China initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centres designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had ""graduated.""
Several Western brands including H&M, Burberry and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have been hit by consumer boycotts in China after raising concerns about reports of forced labour in Xinjiang.

In March, the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials, citing human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing retaliated immediately with its own punitive measures.
Human Rights Watch this year documented what it said could constitute crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",The regulatory and legal headwinds facing Robinhood,"By Chris Prentice and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc, the online brokerage at the center of this year's retail trading frenzy, disclosed on Thursday previously unreported regulatory risks in its long-awaited initial public offering filing. 
Amid an increasingly hostile climate in Democrat-led Washington, Robinhood's growing regulatory attention could be a turn off for some potential investors. 
Aside from fines, Robinhood noted that government probes could result in business restrictions, increased compliance controls, changes to products and services and brand damage. 
The company, which boasts 18 million customers, had drawn regulatory penalties for system outages and misleading disclosures even before it sparked outcry by curbing trading in some shares at the height of January's ""meme stock"" saga. [L4N2K9478]
That episode sparked multiple probes and intensified scrutiny of Robinhood's business model. 
To date, the startup has paid more than $136 million to settle regulators' allegations of wrongdoing, including a $70 million penalty announced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on Wednesday. [L2N2OC1P1] 
While those penalties are small by Wall Street standards, Robinhood's legal expenses are growing fast, jumping from $1.4 million in 2019 to $105 million last year, the filings show. 
Here are some of the regulatory threats that Robinhood noted in connection to its IPO.
'MEME STOCK' PROBES
Robinhood said that regulators had issued subpoenas or sought testimony and information from the company and CEO Vladimir Tenev as part of investigations into trading restrictions the brokerage imposed during January's meme-stock volatility.
The regulators included the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), FINRA, the New York Attorney General's Office, other state attorneys general, Congress and some state securities regulators. 
Perhaps the biggest revelation, though, was that authorities also took the unusual step of seizing Tenev's cell phone, Robinhood said, without elaborating.
OTHER INVESTIGATIONS, LEGAL RISKS
Robinhood also revealed what appeared to be a previously unreported probe by New York's Department of Financial Services (DYFS) focused on anti-money laundering and cybersecurity issues that the company expects to settle for around $15 million.
Additionally, in April, the California Attorney General's Office issued a subpoena seeking documents and information about Robinhood's trading platform, business and operations, and the application of California's commodities regulations to the platform. The company said it is co-operating with the probe. 
Unrelated to the meme stock episode, the Massachusetts Securities Division (MSD) sued Robinhood in December alleging unethical and dishonest conduct and failure to act in accordance with its fiduciary duty among other lapses. Robinhood is fighting the suit. 
The NYDFS, attorneys general for New York and California, and FINRA declined to comment. The SEC and MSD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company is also the target of more than 50 private lawsuits related to January's trading restrictions and other issues.
NEW REGULATIONS
Due to the meme stock saga, policymakers are scrutinizing practices core to Robinhood's business model, most notably payment-for-order-flow (PFOF), whereby brokers route retail orders to wholesale brokers in return for payment. 
PFOF and other transaction rebates accounted for 75% of Robinhood's $959 million in 2020 revenues, Robinhood said.
SEC chair Gary Gensler has said PFOF raises conflict of interest and competition concerns, and he has asked staff to recommend new rules. 

The agency is also examining ""gamification,"" the use of game-like features to encourage trading, as well as other rules relating to liquidity and risk management. 
New regulation in these areas could require ""significant changes to our business model,"" Robinhood warned. Because its competitors are not as reliant on PFOF, heightened regulation of the practice ""could have an outsize impact on our results,"" Robinhood said.

(Reuters) - The typical soldier in the army of retail traders upending Wall Street is a 31-year old who grabs their smartphone seven times a day to check the assets in their first-ever brokerage account, which may well hold a good chunk of cryptocurrencies in addition to stocks. 
Those broad strokes describing retail traders are among the nuggets found in the July 1 filing by online brokerage firm Robinhood Markets, which is aiming for an initial public offering worth over $40 billion.
In its filing, the firm includes facts about its more than 18 million customers and describes some of the potential risks of investing in the company, which increased its headcount from 289 in December, 2018 to more than 2,100 in March of this year as retail trading took off.
The detailed breakdown of Robinhood's user base offers a glimpse at the individual traders gathering in online forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, whose activity has helped fuel wild rides in shares of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and a slew of other so-called meme stocks.
Here are a few highlights from the filing:
-- As of March 31, 2021, the median age of customers on the company’s platform was 31.
-- From January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2021, over half of the customers funding accounts on the platform said Robinhood was their first brokerage account. 
-- Customers visited the app an average of nearly seven times a day in 2020, a year that saw wild swings in markets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
-- The firm believes that close to 50% of all new retail funded accounts opened in the United States from 2016 to 2021 were new accounts created on Robinhood.
-- Robinhood's assets under custody at the end of 2021’s first quarter include roughly $65 billion in equities, $2 billion in options, $11.6 billion in cryptocurrencies and $7.6 billion in cash.
-- Cryptocurrencies have been huge for the company. In the first quarter, Robinhood saw over 9.5 million customers trade about $88 billion of cryptocurrency on the platform. Crypto assets have grown 23-fold between March 31, 2020 and the end of this year's first quarter.
-- A substantial portion of the recent growth in Robinhood’s net revenue is earned from transactions attributable to Dogecoin, the company said. The price of Dogecoin, which has been touted by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has surged by more than 10,000% in the past year, according to Coingecko.com.

“If demand for transactions in Dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,” the filing said. 
-- Most Robinhood customers are primarily buy-and-hold investors, the company said, echoing a refrain often heard on WallStreetBets, where users exhort each other to hold onto their favorite meme stocks in the face of eye-popping volatility.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant are emerging in various corners of global financial markets, even as U.S. stocks hover near record highs.
The Delta variant is now present in over 90 countries and has become the most prevalent variant among new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to California-based genomics company Helix.
So far, however, it is hard to tell how much the new strain will disrupt the global growth rebound that has helped power risk assets higher in recent months.
Here are some assets where concerns over the Delta variant may be moving the needle.

TRAVEL AND LEISURE STOCKS
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp made the list of the 25 worst performing stocks over the last 1 month, a Reuters analysis showed. The Dow Jones U.S. Travel & Leisure Index fell 3.35% in June, compared with a 2.2% gain for the S&P 500 Index.
Oil prices, which were hammered in the wake of the pandemic, rose about 10% in June, however.

CURRENCIES
Worries over the Delta variant are weighing on the currencies of countries where it is spreading quickly, including the Australian dollar and British pound.
The moves have contributed to a rally in the U.S. dollar that was sparked by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift and saw the U.S. currency gain 2.7% against a basket of peers in June.
""Early on I think the risks of the Delta variant were most apparent in British pound,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at FX payments firm Tempus Inc.
""Now I think it is most apparent in the Oceanic currencies that are generally tied to Asian risk sentiment.""

TREASURIES
Some investors have piled into Treasuries in recent weeks, fueled by expectations that U.S. growth may be peaking and the Fed will be less tolerant of rising consumer prices. Some investors believe fresh uncertainty over Covid-19 may be accelerating the move in yields on U.S. government bonds, which are among the world’s most popular haven assets.
""The fear that incremental lockdowns could reappear has recently been a factor"" in Treasury positioning, wrote Arnim Holzer, strategist with EAB Investment Group, in a note on Wednesday.
""Multi-asset and safety seeking does look to be gaining a bit of interest with U.S. Treasury and dollar strength,"" Holzer said.

GROWTH VS VALUE
So-called value stocks - companies that trade at low multiples to book value and tend to be more sensitive to economic cycles - ripped higher earlier this year on expectations of an economic rebound but have stumbled lately.
Meanwhile, shares of growth names, including stay-at-home bets like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) and ETSY Inc, have risen.

JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic believes the shift resembles one that took place in February, when investors briefly grew defensive on worries over the Alpha variant, only to sell bonds and pile back into value stocks when the threat had passed.
""We expect this to repeat now as investors assess the so-called Delta variant,"" Kolanovic said.

The rules are the latest in an effort by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) to rein in China's free-wheeling platform economy, which has seen it levy fines, launch investigations and issue warnings to booming e-commerce giants.
""The pricing practices have been widespread among online platforms and it is a hidden problem to ordinary consumers because it's not very easy to notice,"" said Lu Zhenwang, chief executive officer of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy.
Consumers over the years have complained on social media that e-commerce platforms don't charge the same price for the same offerings.
Among the practices banned in the rules proposed on Friday are subsidies that cut the price of a product to below cost.
Violation of the rules could incur a fine of 0.1% to 0.5% of a business' annual sales or even suspension of operations, SAMR said.
In an April meeting with the market regulator in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, platform companies including JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, Meituan,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s food delivery arm Ele.me, Trip.com and Didi Chuxing pledged not to take advantage of big data to charge loyal customers more. 
In March, state news agency Xinhua reported that Alibaba's online travel agency Fliggy offered different ticket prices for the same flight, with more loyal users getting a higher price. In the same article, Xinhua said Meituan charged different prices for the same pet care product. 
Alibaba and Meituan did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters on Friday. 
In October, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism imposed a rule banning the practice of differentiated pricing by online travel services.

In April, SAMR fined Alibaba a record 18 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) for abuse of its dominant market position and announced an antitrust investigation into Meituan.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) was up by more than 27% during Friday’s premarket trading as the company said it will launch founder Richard Branson and a full crew into space by July 11.
If the flight goes as scheduled, Branson will beat Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos in a race of billionaires to fly to the space. Bezos is scheduled to fly on July 20.
The other contender, Elon Musk, is yet to announce a date for his flight.
Virgin had last week secured the U.S. aviation safety regulator’s nod to fly humans into space.
Branson's July 11 mission will be the twenty-second flight test for VSS Unity, and the company's fourth crewed spaceflight, Virgin said.
But it will be the first to carry a full crew of two pilots and four ""mission specialists,"" including Branson.
A successful flight by Branson aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane would mark a key milestone in a race to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.
UBS estimates commercial space travel will be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030.
Two additional test flights are planned before Virgin begins a commercial service which should happen next year, according to a company note.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>","Delta variant sweeps Asia, prompting curbs as vaccination remains tepid","By Hyonhee Shin and Swati Pandey
SEOUL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is surging through Asia this week, with record numbers of infections in Australia and South Korea, prompting some countries to tighten curbs and others to hasten vaccination.
The variant, first detected in India in December last year, has spread to about 100 countries and the World Health Organisation warned recently that it could soon become the dominant form of the virus. It is also driving a spike in cases in Japan, casting a pall over this month's Olympic Games.
On Friday, Australia's New South Wales state, its most populous, reported the biggest daily rise in new cases so far this year. Total cases in the state in the latest outbreak have topped 200, a majority caused by the Delta variant.
Sydney, home to a fifth of the country's 25 million population, is half-way through a two-week lockdown to contain the outbreak, which has alarmed authorities amid a sluggish nationwide vaccination drive.
""I think the vaccine will certainly reduce the disease, it will certainly reduce hospitalisation. But we'll certainly have the virus circulating in the community for those people who aren't vaccinated,"" said Professor Jill Carr, a virologist with the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University.
Australia, like several other countries in Asia, has struggled to inoculate people as initial successes in containing the pandemic led to vaccine hesitancy, and manufacturers were slow to ship doses.
Australia has fully vaccinated only 6% of its population, while Japan has vaccinated 12%.
Japan reported on Wednesday that the Delta variant now accounts for nearly a third of all cases in the eastern part of the country, including Tokyo, and that could grow to 50% by mid July. 
Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures are among areas under a 'quasi' state of emergency set to run through July 11 and the recent uptick in infections has officials leaning towards keeping restrictions in place, government sources have told Reuters. 
On Friday, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike reiterated that a ban on spectators for the Olympic Games, which start on July 23, would be an option if the coronavirus situation worsened.
In South Korea, officials said on Friday daily coronavirus cases topped 800, the highest in nearly six months, with vaccination below 10%. The average number of new infections in the country has risen for 10 days straight, and authorities in Seoul have delayed relaxing social distancing measures.
""The Delta variant is a strain that is most optimised for widespread transmissions,"" said Chun Eun-mi, a respiratory disease specialist at Ewha Womans University Medical Center in Seoul.
""The cases of Indonesia, India and Britain show that not just Korea but many other countries will need to rethink their vaccine strategy and reopening plans,"" she said.
Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, imposed emergency measures that begin on Saturday until July 20 to contain a spike in cases.
In India, the number of new infections has eased to two-month lows since hitting a peak of 400,000 a day in May, with the government focusing on mass vaccinations.
COVID CERTIFICATE
The United States has also seen a rise in Delta variant infections in parts of the country where vaccination rates remain low, and the White House said on Thursday it would send special assistance to those hot spots.
Europe, too, is battling an increase in infections, which the WHO has blamed on crowds at Euro 2020 football stadiums. It has warned that a new wave was inevitable if people did not remain disciplined.
Britain is gearing up to lift lockdown restrictions on July 19, even as Delta variant cases rise. Germany said on Thursday it expects the variant to account for up to 80% of infections this month and Portugal imposed night-time curfews.
The fresh cases have put a damper on summer tourism in the continent, although the launch of a European Union COVID-19 travel certificate may prompt more travel.
Europe's drug regulator said on Thursday the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the European Union offered protection against all coronavirus variants, including Delta.
In Asia, international tourism is largely suspended.
The exception is Thailand's tourist isle of Phuket, which reopened on Thursday to fully vaccinated travellers from overseas in a step towards reviving a battered industry.
Still, Thailand on Friday reported the third straight day of record coronavirus deaths. The Alpha variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, is still the dominant variant in the country, although authorities said they expect the Delta variant to dominate in the next few months.

""In Bangkok it is nearly 40%, within this month or next, it will all be Delta,"" said Kumnuan Ungchusak, adviser to the health ministry.
""If this keeps going we cannot survive,"" he said referring to the rising death count.

Central banks around the world are busy working out what their role should be in the fight against climate change, and ECB President Christine Lagarde is keen to incorporate it into monetary policy.
""Central banks have a balance sheet, we have assets generated by our monetary policy activity,"" Hernandez de Cos told a panel organised by Spain's Energy and Environment Ministry.
""We could potentially make our purchases of corporate bonds, or our collateral, we could make the acceptance or purchase of those conditional on the companies whose bonds we are going to buy meeting established conditions on releasing information that obviously also helps us in the fight against climate change.""
Until now, the ECB's guiding principle in a five year-old programme of corporate bond purchases that now totals hundreds of billions of euros has been one of market neutrality, buying bonds in proportion to their outstanding amounts.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson will travel to the edge of space on Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc's test flight on July 11, Branson's space tourism firm said on Thursday, beating out fellow aspiring billionaire astronaut Jeff Bezos. 
A successful flight by Branson aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane would mark a key milestone in a race to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel. 
It would also mean that Branson would travel beyond Earth's atmosphere ahead of Bezos, the founder of rival space tourism venture Blue Origin.
Bezos, who founded retail giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is slated to fly to space on July 20 along with his brother, Mark, trailblazing female pilot Wally Funk and a so-far unidentified person who plunked down $28 million to join the suborbital joyride.
Reuters reported last month that Branson was considering a show-stealing mission just days ahead of Bezos' planned trip.
The race, which also includes SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk, is underpinned by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall, fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030. Musk has not set a date for his space flight.
""Virgin Galactic stands at the vanguard of a new commercial space industry, which is set to open space to humankind and change the world for good,"" Branson said in a statement accompanying Virgin's announcement. 
Branson's July 11 mission will be the twenty-second flight test for VSS Unity, and the company's fourth crewed spaceflight, Virgin said.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 04:06AM ET</span>",Chip supply situation 'still difficult' - Infineon CEO,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - Strains in the semiconductor supply chain have worsened in some areas as trends such as remote working combine with an industrial recovery from last year's pandemic slump to drive chip demand, the head of Germany's Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) said.
The ability of chipmakers to add capacity is limited, while some in Asia face further production constraints as they seek to contain COVID-19 outbreaks in their workforces, CEO Reinhard Ploss told Reuters.
""The situation is still difficult – in some areas it's even more than difficult,"" Ploss, 65, said in an interview.
Pandemic trends such as remote working and home schooling have powered demand for high-end consumer electronics, straining supplies of lower-margin chips to manufacturers and forcing many car makers to idle production in the first half of 2021.
Infineon, the leading supplier of power semiconductors to the automotive industry, relies heavily on contract chip manufacturers such as TSMC with which it is in a ""deep dialogue"" on meeting customer needs, said Ploss.
He had chided the contractors in May for failing to invest enough in new capacity, with Infineon particularly hit by scarcity in the older 20- to 90-nanometer chips used across its product range.
Infineon was better able to meet demand for the specialist products it makes in-house, with its new plant in Villach, Austria, due to launch production soon while its facility in Dresden, Germany, still has spare capacity.
""We have two sites to ramp, which is advantageous (compared) to the majority of our competitors who are short on everything,"" said Ploss.
Still, the overall level of product stocks Infineon has on hand is depleted, said Ploss. Bringing supply into balance with demand would require chipmakers to run a temporarily overloaded supply chain, he added.
WHO NEEDS THIS?
The chip supply crunch has provoked debate in Europe about whether to invest in new production capacity to reduce its dependence on imports from the Asian manufacturers that dominate the industry.
Ploss, however, questioned the goal set by Brussels of building a state-of-the-art 2 nanometer plant.
""If the decision was made for a 2 nanometer factory in Europe, I would question who the customers should be,"" he said.
""Mobile phone companies? There aren't that many of those around in Europe anymore. Computer manufacturers? We may use computers here but we do not build them.""

Industrial policy should focus on playing to Europe's traditional strengths in manufacturing, said Ploss.
""Once it comes to taking the next step, I definitely think that Europe has to think in domains of strength,"" said Ploss. ""But, as always, before moving into new fields, we should strengthen our strengths and push the envelope from there.""

The move brings a grassroots element to a string of deals announced by Facebook in Australia since the country legislated to make it and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google negotiate content payments to media outlets or risk government arbitration.
Since the law took effect in February, dominant news providers like News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd and the Australian Broadcasting Corp have signed deals or letters of intent with the Big Tech players.
The deal planned by Country Press Australia (CPA) and the tech giant would bring Facebook money closer to mastheads like The Bunyip, circulation 8,750, and Gympie Today, circulation 4,000, since they are among the 170 outlets represented by it.
Terms of the deal including time frame, the amount of money and how it will be divided or spent were not disclosed in a joint statement from CPA and Facebook. The statement said the parties had signed a letter of intent to strike a deal only.
""This funding support will help Country Press Australia's members build their digital businesses and reach new audiences,"" said Facebook's news partnership lead for Australia and New Zealand, Andrew Hunter.
""It's part of our continuing investment in Australian journalism and our collaboration with the news industry to build sustainable business models,"" he added.

CPA President Andrew Manuel said the Facebook funding would ""help sustain original public interest journalism in the multitude of regional and local communities"" where the body's member newspapers were published.
Before the Australian laws were passed, Facebook and Google campaigned against them including a move by Facebook to cut all content from newsfeeds in the country briefly. The U.S. firms have since unveiled numerous deals, although some smaller publishers have said they still have not been able to get to negotiating tables.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) on Friday declared a record investment return of 37.8 trillion yen ($338.8 billion) for the year ended March 31, raking in the benefits of a robust rally in global stock markets.
GPIF heavily relies on a passive index-tracking strategy so its returns usually mirror market movement. Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 55% in the last financial year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced more than 50%, as market sentiment rose in tandem with progress made in pandemic-busting vaccination programmes worldwide.
The world's largest pension fund, which managed 186.2 trillion yen worth of assets as of March-end, said in a statement it had an annual return of 14.7 trillion yen on domestic stocks and 20.7 trillion yen on foreign equities.
It said January-March return was 10 trillion yen.
GPIF's investments are closely watched by global investors because of the fund's sheer size. GPIF has recently shifted its portfolio away from unprofitable domestic bonds toward higher-yielding foreign assets, given ultra-low interest rates at home.
Foreign bond holdings made up 24.61% of GPIF's assets under management in January-March, compared with a record high of 25.71% in the previous quarter.
Holdings of Japanese bonds were at 25.92%, up from a record low of 23.64% in October-December.
To diversify its portfolio, GPIF has put more focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment as global investors warm to that rapidly expanding market segment.

The fund poured around 10.6 trillion yen into ESG-related domestic and foreign equities as of March-end, compared to a 5.7 trillion yen a year earlier.
