DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwait's prosecutors have asked Dubai to release $500 million in funds belonging to a Kuwaiti private equity fund that were frozen as part of a money laundering investigation, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The funds, held at a Dubai-based bank, were frozen at the behest of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) central bank in November 2017, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter and legal documents and correspondence between parties involved in the case reviewed by Reuters.
According to a senior UAE official, the probe, which has not been previously reported, was undertaken by Dubai authorities to determine if funds sent from a bank in the Philippines to the Kuwaiti private equity fund's account in Dubai constituted money laundering.
The probe comes as the UAE tightens financial regulations to fight a perception among some foreign investors that it is a hot spot for illicit money flows owing to its free trade zones and geographic proximity to Iran, the target of U.S. sanctions.
But the freezing of funds, which Kuwait says are owed in part to two of its state entities, could test its relationship with regional ally Dubai, which has not disclosed the reason for the money laundering investigation.
In the letter, dated Oct. 16, Kuwait's attorney general asked his counterpart in Dubai to help release the funds.
The letter said two local government entities - the country's port authority and its pension fund - were owed a total of around $200 million.
""We ask for your constructive cooperation to order the release of the funds and transfer $125 million to Kuwait Port Authority's account and $79.2 million to the account of Public Institution for Social Security,"" the letter said. 
Both entities are among investors in Port Fund, a Cayman Islands-registered private equity fund.
The remainder of the frozen funds would be distributed to ""those (other) shareholders who have rights,"" the letter from Kuwait's attorney general said, without naming them.
The Kuwait public prosecutor's office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment about the content of the letter.
A Dubai government spokeswoman confirmed that an investigation into the funds frozen at Noor Bank was ongoing. Asked about the request by Kuwait's attorney general to release the funds, the spokeswoman said the government did not want to comment further on the matter.
Dubai authorities are investigating the initial transfer of the $500 million to an account held by Port Link, which manages Port Fund, at Dubai's state-owned Noor Bank, according to a July 2018 letter about the case sent by the UAE central bank governor to the country's ambassador in the United States.
The letter, also seen by Reuters, said the case related to ""money laundering offences"" linked to individuals in Kuwait ""suspected of public funds embezzlement and corruption.""
The letter did not name any individual and did not detail the allegations.
It said that at the time, Dubai and Kuwaiti state prosecutors were in contact with each other to investigate the lawfulness of the transaction.
U.S.-based law firm Crowell and Moring, which represents Port Fund, told Reuters that the money was a legitimate payment after Port Fund sold its investments in the Philippines.
The firm said that aside from the two Kuwaiti state entities, international investors, institutional investors in the Gulf and creditors – including U.S. advisers – were also owed some of the frozen funds.
The $496 million in question was transferred on Nov. 14, 2017, by Philippine bank BDO Unibank to Port Link's account in Dubai, according to interbank messages seen by Reuters between BDO and Citibank, which acted as the U.S. intermediary involved in the transfer.
BDO said in a statement to Reuters the transaction was legitimate and complied with all banking rules. A Citi spokesman declined to comment.
Susan Shoury, a spokeswoman for Noor Bank, said the bank is committed to the highest standards of compliance, governance and internal controls.

Alibaba President Michael Evans said he was ""not too concerned"" about the trade fracas damping sales during the event that kicks off Sunday. ""11/11 is not an event that relies exclusively on any one market,"" Evans told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday. ""We will be working with over 200 countries and regions as part of this enormous event and so we don’t expect any one area to have a huge amount of influence, other than China of course.""
Regarding the Chinese economy, Evans said there’s ""some uncertainty about what will happen going forward,"" while noting growth in the country is still running at about 6.5 percent a year.
Alibaba has seen softer demand for big-ticket items, such as washing machines, televisions and automobiles, Evans said. But other sectors, like cosmetics, food, fashion and apparel, are still going strong. The company is focusing on the 300 million Chinese people who are expected to enter the ranks of the middle class over the next five years, Evans said.
The company, based in Hangzhou, China, markets itself as a way for global brands to reach the Chinese consumer, with more than 10,000 American brands, including  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that sell their goods on Alibaba’s Tmall Global site. Billionaire co-founder Jack Ma has been a vocal opponent of the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. and Chinese goods, calling the trade war ""the most stupid thing in this world."" China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods include products like food and wine, which are popular items sold on Alibaba’s platforms.
Alibaba has already discarded its pledge to create a million jobs in the U.S., but it has not “given up our initiatives to create jobs in the U.S. for small businesses,” Evans said. ""It is a little bit more difficult if tensions between these two governments continue, because we don’t want to get caught in the middle of geopolitical discussions."""

24,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 12:13PM ET</span>",Telecom Italia board approves non-binding offer for Brazil's Nextel: sources,"By Agnieszka Flak , Gram Slattery and Tatiana Bautzer
MILAN/RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) has given its Brazil unit approval to make a non-binding offer for NII Holdings' (O:NIHD) Nextel Brazil, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, allowing for a potential deal that could boost its market share in Latin America's largest economy.
Any offer would be made through Telecom Italia's Brazilian unit TIM Participacoes SA (SA:TIMP3) and could kick off a long-awaited consolidation in Brazilian telecoms. One of the sources warned that the process was still early and the company was still studying whether to extend any offer.
All sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
NII's U.S.-listed shares have appreciated some 1,670 percent year-to-date on expectations of a possible takeover bid, bringing its market capitalization to some $754 million after Thursday's stock market close. This is despite the firm having fewer than 3 million clients and almost no earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Much of Nextel's value comes from its spectrum rights in the wealthier Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, particularly its 1800 and 2100 MHz frequencies, which are key for Brazil's fast-growing and high-margin data segment.
A representative for TIM Participacoes referred Reuters to public statements by Telecom Italia officials. In a telephone conference on Friday, Telecom Italia Chief Executive Amos Genish said the company was interested in Nextel's Brazil unit, but that the process was in its initial phase.
Telecom Italia would be happy to participate in consolidation in Brazil, he added.
One of the sources said NII was expecting to receive the first non-binding offers within weeks. NII's chief financial officer, Daniel Freiman, did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
A decision by Brazilian telecoms regulator Anatel last week to loosen spectrum cap limits in Brazil helped spur the decision to look into a non-binding offer, one source said. Previous Brazilian regulations effectively prohibited a Nextel acquisition by a domestic player, as the country's largest telecoms operators were nearing the limit of how much spectrum they could hold in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
 Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Brasil SA (SA:VIVT4), the country's largest telecom operator, has cooled on a potential Nextel acquisition, as the company focuses on its broadband segment, three sources with knowledge of the matter said in recent weeks. The firm's chief operating officer told Reuters in April the company would likely dedicate some 7.5 billion reais of capital expenditure from 2018 through 2020 to broadband expansion.
A representative for Vivo, as Telefonica Brasil is branded, declined to comment.
Shares of NII Holdings surged some 17 percent in pre-market trading on the possible TIM bid, before paring gains to 4.4 percent at midday. Brazil-listed TIM Participacoes shares edged 0.4 lower, while shares in Telecom Italia fell 4.8 percent after the company took a 2 billion euro ($2.27 billion) writedown on its domestic assets and abandoned its 2018 net debt to core earnings target.
Reuters first reported in June that NII had hired Rothschild & Co (PA:ROTH) to explore a sale of Nextel Brazil.

Nextel Brazil is NII's last operation in Latin America after it exited operations in Peru, Chile and Mexico, where its unit was sold for $1.9 billion to AT&T Inc (N:T) three years ago.

29,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Greed Isn't So Good Right Now for U.S. Stocks, Cantor Says","(Bloomberg) -- Cantor Fitzgerald is calling time-out on the S&P 500’s rebound off recent lows.
Fictional “Wall Street” character Gordon Gekko may have said greed “is good,” but Cantor’s Chief Market Strategist Peter Cecchini sees it as a sign that markets may have gotten overextended.
“Greed appears to have replaced panic,” he wrote. “We just don’t think market participants have much reason to chase too much further.”
The strategist downgraded his tactical stance on U.S. stocks to “neutral to slightly bearish,” a reversal of his Oct. 11 upgrade, citing the normalization in the VIX futures curve’s term structure back into upward-sloping contango as a signal that the market angst has disappeared.
During periods of market stress, near-term VIX futures contracts -- a gauge of the implied swings in the S&P 500 -- become more expensive than their longer-dated counterparts, an indication that traders are acutely focused on near-term risks to stocks.
The downgrade brings Cantor Fitzgerald’s short and medium-term U.S. stock market outlooks into harmony once again. Cecchini has a ""quite cautious view"" of global risk assets for 2019, given the Federal Reserve’s intention to continue hiking rates in the face of foreign and domestic struggles. The headwind of the strengthening dollar on U.S. large-cap stocks is poised to intensify, he said.

China's taxation authority will roll out targeted policies such as suggesting the local governments to give private firms a respite for paying taxes, SAT head Wang Jun told Xinhua in an interview.
Chinese financial institutions will continue to remain exempted from value-added tax for their interest incomes from loans to small and micro companies to encourage a flow of funds to the private sector, the report said.
The SAT will expand its program that allows businesses with sound tax-paying records to secure loans without collateral, the Xinhua report said, adding that more efforts will be taken to implement tax deductions to help companies operating abroad.
Premier Li Keqiang had earlier said that China will push for larger tax cuts and that it would help small firms facing funding difficulties and widen access for private firms in infrastructure.

35,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Spain Bonds Seen Giving Shelter as Italy Muddles Through Budget,"(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s bonds may work out for investors in the long run, though investors may do well to look elsewhere in Europe in the meanwhile, according to HSBC Plc.
The U.K. bank is recommending that investors position for a further worsening of the relationship between populist leaders in Rome and the European Union by selling Italian bonds versus their Spanish peers. That’s because both sides are likely to drive a hard bargain, driving volatility higher, before an agreement is found.
“In the long run, we are optimistic that a compromise will be found, but the path to get there may not be smooth,” wrote Chris Attfield, a London-based fixed-income strategist at HSBC. “If the EU takes a harder line to preserve its credibility, and that of the fiscal rules, it risks a confrontation, which could lead to sanctions, political tension and possibly a rise in Euroskeptic sentiment.”
Italian bonds have held steady after S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service refrained from docking the nation to junk following the government’s plans to widen the budget deficit next year. The EU has come down on the nation’s leaders firmly, stating Thursday that their growth targets were overly ambitious and the fiscal shortfall would be wider than anticipated, putting it in breach of the bloc’s rules.
HSBC recommends entering a widening trade between Italy’s 2.8 percent bond maturing in Dec. 2028 versus Spain’s 1.4 percent bond due in July 2028, with the former offering 185 basis points more than the latter on Friday. Attfield expects the spread to widen to 210 basis points by the end of the year.
The bank’s recommendation comes after Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $115 billion, reposed its faith on Spain, saying that the “underlying story” on the nation remains positive.

Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, has accused the 149-year-old packaged food company of mismanagement and destroying shareholder value.
In September the hedge fund had nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell's controlling family, to replace all Campbell board members at the company's Nov. 29 shareholder meeting.
Campbell has pushed for its board to remain intact. It did not respond to a request for comment on Third Point's latest move.
Heirs of the Dorrances, one of America's richest families, have long controlled Campbell and currently sit on its board.
The heirs have said they intend to vote their 41 percent ownership stake in favor of Campbell's current board.
In comparison, Third Point owns a roughly 7 percent stake in Campbell.
Loeb's smaller slate of five includes Third Point executive Munib Islam, Comscore (O:SCOR) executive Sarah Hofstetter, pet food maker Blue Buffalo's CEO Kurt Schmidt, Hostess Brands' (O:TWNK) former CEO William Toler and Bozoma Saint John, a former Uber executive.

""We now understand that the Short Slate is exactly what is needed to set Campbell on a sustainable path to renewed competitiveness and growth,"" Third Point said in a letter to Campbell shareholders.

The Dow fell 135.16, or 0.52%, to 26,056.06, while the broader S&P 500 index fell 21.38, or 0.76%, to 2,785.45. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 95.62, or 1.27%, to 7,435.26.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.6% in October, while the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5%. Both were hotter than expected, with economists forecasting a 0.2% rise for each.
The unexpectedly high rise in wholesale inflation just lent more credence to the market’s belief that the Federal Reserve will hike rates by another quarter point at its December meeting.
The Fed’s statement yesterday, where it kept rates steady, indicated little that would alter its course for slow and steady increases in December and through next year.
Global markets were also hit by producer inflation, although a drop in this case, as producer prices in China fell for the fourth-straight month, raising more concerns that the world’s second-largest economy is struggling as it battles the U.S. in a trade war.
Energy stocks took a hit as oil fell below $60, extending its move into bear-market territory as traders focused on increasing U.S. supply and the lack of real impact of oil sanctions on Iran.

The move comes months after Beijing started allowing foreign companies to apply for licenses and ahead of a G20 meeting in Argentina where the United States and China will try to resolve their trade disputes.
The preliminary approval allows the company to process and settle payments in yuan domestically by setting up its own network with its Chinese joint venture partner LianLian Group.
Rivals Visa (N:V) and Mastercard (N:MA) have also submitted requests for licenses but are yet to get approval.
AmEx's JV, named Express (Hangzhou) Technology Services Co, is required to complete operation preparations within a year and get a nod from the central bank before running the card clearing business, the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website.
The approval is a ""significant step toward opening up China's bank card market to foreign investors"", the central bank said, adding that it would continue to ease in an orderly way market access for clearing and settlement institutions.
Up until now, foreign card companies have had to partner with China's UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that enjoyed a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country, for access to the country's payments network.
Foreign card companies, especially behemoths like Visa and Mastercard, have been lobbying for more than a decade for direct access to China - where the number of cards in circulation is expected to rise to 9 billion by 2020 from 6 billion in 2016, according to research firm GlobalData Plc.
UnionPay counts Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) among its partners for payments-related services in China.
Visa was the first to submit its application for a license in July 2017 but its request was put on hold and the company was asked to firm up its local equity partnership before resubmitting its application, sources told Reuters last year. https://reut.rs/2AVx1Hx

Mastercard told Reuters on Friday that it would continue to remain engaged with regulators during the application process.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 09:33AM ET</span>",A big short growing in Italian debt,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - A surge of interest in Italian bond futures may be a sign of a substantial short position building up in the derivatives market as tensions rise over budget negotiations between Rome and Brussels.
The big short in the futures market reflects a buildup in speculative and hedging activity after a tumultuous summer in the Italian markets and also indicates rising concerns of capital outflows.
Investors say it also leaves the market potentially open to a sharp rebound if the debt story improves in some way over the coming months either through a breakthrough in negotiations over the debt dynamics or approval from credit rating agencies.
As Italy's anti-establishment government attempts to pass an expansionary budget in the face of opposition from the European Union, investors are ramping up their use of a product that is increasingly being used to take bets that more losses are in store for the country's bonds.
Italy has the biggest outstanding bond market in the euro zone and futures trading has rocketed in recent months as hedge funds have stepped up their presence, even as the underlying cash bond markets have shown signs of stress during extreme episodes of volatility.
Average daily turnover so far this year for short-term BTP futures contracts have surged 40 percent to nearly 70,000 contracts compared to 2017 while longer-term BTP futures have also grown substantially, according to futures exchange, Eurex.
The rise in turnover has also been accompanied by surging yields and growing open interest or the amount of positions left outstanding, indicating speculators are comfortable in taking outright short bets, according to market players.
For example, open interest on short-dated BTP futures <0#FBTS:> peaked at a record 280,000 contracts on Oct. 25 and has consistently averaged around 275,000 contracts in the last two weeks.
""Clearly today there are a number of investors, including large hedge fund investors who are taking large short positions on Italian debt through both the short and long-dated BTP futures,"" said Mark Dowding, head of developed markets at BlueBay Asset Management.
In contrast to the growing popularity of bond futures, turnover in credit default swaps has declined as the increased scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the euro zone crisis dimmed its allure for taking speculative bets.
For example, net outstanding dollar value of credit default swaps (CDS) contracts on Italy has declined by more than a quarter to less than $12 billion in the week ending November 6, compared to the beginning of 2017, according to data from post-trade provider Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.
""In a world where investors can't take naked short positions by buying sovereign CDS, Italian futures are the instrument to use if you want to implement a short view,"" Dowding added. 
GRAPHIC: Spike in open interest in 2-yr BTP Futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P2MCh1
TAKING BETS
A portfolio manager at a macro-hedge fund in London said he uses futures to take bets on Italian debt because the margining system in futures contracts makes it less capital intensive than purchasing bonds.
Margining refers to the practice in futures markets, wherein investors have to cough up only a chunk of the notional value contract, allowing them to take bigger positions. In cash or CDS trading, on the other hand, traders have to put up the entire amount in order to take a view.
Despite more capital needed to trade credit default swaps compared to futures, these derivatives, designed to protect against the risk of debt default, were widely used by investors looking to hedge the possibility of sovereign default, especially in Greece, during the 2010-2012 debt crisis.
CDS were used also to take directional bets on a market, sometimes even when the investor did not own the bond prompting regulators to bring in rules banning ""naked"" CDS trading -- purchasing CDS contracts in a purely speculative manner without having exposure to the underlying asset.
The increased scrutiny on CDS trading by regulators fueled appetite for trading bond futures as investors welcomed their transparent settlement mechanisms and liquidity, particularly during times of market stress. 
So this year, when a severe Italian bond selloff kicked off in May, futures trading exploded where open interest has increased every month barring May, June and September this year. 
Seamus MacGorain, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, said futures trading activity also tends to spike during periods of volatility because that is usually accompanied by across-the-board liquidity declines.
Decline in liquidity is evident from widening bid-offer spreads -- the difference between prices what investors pay to execute a trade with wider spreads indicating falling liquidity.
In September for instance, monthly weighted average bid-offer spreads on five-year bonds stood at a chunky 13 basis points, the Italian Treasury's website says.
Those spreads were a fraction in the futures markets, according to a bond trader. 
""Italian bond market liquidity fell during summer's market volatility, and continues to be impaired,"" MacGorain said.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey signed an agreement on Friday with military vehicle producer BMC for the mass production of the Turkish-designed Altay battle tank, part of the country's efforts to expand its defense industry.
Turkey has been working to develop its own tanks, combat helicopters and other military equipment to boost its defense capabilities amid militant threats and conflict on its southern border.
Under the deal with BMC, the company will initially produce 40 Altay tanks, with the first to be delivered to the military in 18 months, according to a presentation by the government's Defence Industry Directorate (SSB) during the signing ceremony.
After the initial batch is delivered, a further 210 tanks would be built, the presentation showed.
Officials at the ceremony declined to say how much the project was worth.
Alongside BMC, others involved in the project include Turkish firms Roketsan,  Aselsan  (IS:ASELS), MKE and Havelsan.
BMC also signed a deal with SSB in June to develop a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine and other systems for the Altay tanks.
The prototype for the tank was developed by military vehicle producer  Otokar  (IS:OTKAR).
BMC Chairman Ethem Sancak said a foreign company would advise BMC on the project, but did not elaborate. BMC has a joint venture with Germany's  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG).
Ismail Demir, the head of SSB, told reporters the engines would not be ready for the first batch of tanks, adding that those tanks were expected to be powered by German engines although Turkey had alternative plans if Germany did not supply them.
Turkey's Kale Group said last year it would set up a joint venture with Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR) to develop aircraft engines including those for the TF-X, the first domestically made jet.
The SSB said last week that missile manufacturer Roketsan would produce Turkey's first marine missiles. President Tayyip Erdogan also said last week that Turkey would produce long-range air defense missile systems.

(Reuters) - India-based motorcycle brand Royal Enfield expects sales in its new North American business to almost triple this year and is aiming to dominate the market for middleweight bikes into which Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) has just shifted in a bid to revive sales.
Enfield, originally a classic UK brand but manufactured by India's  Eicher Motors  Ltd (NS:EICH) in southern India since the early 1970s, has thwarted Harley's efforts to make inroads in India, the world's biggest two-wheeler market with some 17 million in sales annually.
Both companies are dwarfed in the lightweight categories by India's Hero Motor Corp (NS:HROM), Japan's Honda and  Bajaj Auto  (NS:BAJA), and so far Enfield's presence outside India in the more specialized market in medium-sized and large cruisers has been minimal.
Its arrival in North America three years ago signaled another headache for Harley, although sales of its iconic ""Bullet"" and ""Classic"" motorcycles have been stuck in the hundreds.
Based in Milwaukee, also the home town of Harley, Enfield sold between 700 and 800 motorcycles in the year ended March, and expects to sell nearly 2,000 in the current fiscal year, according to its North America president, Rod Copes.
""Our goal, over the next three to five and 10 years, is to be the largest middleweight motorcycle player, not just globally but also in North America. We want to get up to, where we are selling more than 10,000 to 15,000 motorcycles a year,"" Copes told Reuters.
The bikemaker has been able to capitalize on demand by helping younger riders own a cruiser bike, along the lines of Harley's but at a more affordable price point.
Enfield bikes come with a starting price tag of $4,000, which will rise to the $8,000 range following its new launches early next year. Harley's entry level bike prices start at $6,899 and go up to $43,889.
""The U.S. motorcycle market is flipped upside down and the only segment that is growing is the middle-weight. I think we are beginning to see a little bit of a trend and a change in the industry itself, away from maybe the bigger, the better to smaller is funner,"" Copes added.
Harley has been the historical market leader in the heavyweight motorcycle space in the United States and has been expanding into the middleweight motorcycle market with the launch of Street 500, Street 750 and the Street Rod range.
While Harley's shipments have been dropping in the United States as its mainstay customer base is aging, it still managed to ship 144,893 motorcycles in the United States in fiscal 2017, according to its annual SEC filing.

The company does not break down those numbers into bike categories but analysts say almost all of those were heavyweight cruisers.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China paraded industrial and military clout and sent deliberate signals to Western rivals that its aerospace and arms industries aim to catch them up on world markets, while playing down trade tensions at the nation's largest air show this week.
The biennial event in the coastal city of Zhuhai has traditionally been used by Beijing to show off its growing aviation capability, but is also keenly watched by the global industry for clues on where it faces obstacles.
Beijing not only showed off a range of new military kit for export, but unveiled progress in civil wide-body and regional jet programs and deeper cooperation with Russia in a message to the West, industry watchers said.
""You get a real sense of the scale and speed of the development of the past 25 years. They have covered an enormous amount of ground in a really short space of time in terms of defense and aerospace,"" said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the London-based IISS think-tank.
""Everything we have been shown here is pretty much for the export market. You then wonder what isn't being shown; what are they keeping for themselves in terms of capability?""
On display in the sprawling 'weaponry hall' and on other stages to military visitors from Africa to Southeast Asia were ground vehicles, drones ranging from miniature to aircraft-sized and new anti-ship ballistic missiles. 
China's new J-20 stealth jet performed a five-minute-long demonstration - in contrast to a prudent 60-second debut two years ago - though the jet is not expected to be sold overseas.
""There is an interesting element of political signaling,"" said Meia Nouwens, research fellow for Chinese defense policy at the IISS. ""There is a lot of the great China dream and the role that the military play in that.""
NO NEED FOR THE WEST 
The show has been taking place against a backdrop of a tariff spat with the United States and U.S. accusations of espionage by China's state aerospace apparatus.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said weeks before the show that Russia and China should work together to oppose protectionism and what he called unilateral approaches to international problems, a veiled reference to U.S. foreign policy.
The two countries unveiled a mock-up of the CR929 wide-body civil jet, widely seen as a high-level initiative, and signed a helicopter sale in one of the few deals.
A senior executive at Russian state conglomerate Rostec told Reuters both countries were keen to develop their civil aircraft building capabilities to reduce their dependence on the Western companies that currently dominate the supply chain.
""The Chinese-Russian aircraft is showing that they have a choice, that they don't have to buy (aircraft) from the West and that if there are any problems on trade they can develop perfectly adequately in cooperation with Russia,"" said aerospace analyst Sash Tusa of Britain-based Agency Partners.
Helping efforts to showcase the strides China is making in aviation was Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which wants to become a serious competitor to Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) and regional jet players Canada and Brazil.
Three of its self-developed ARJ-21 regional jets, decorated in the liveries of customers including Genghis Khan Airlines, flew demonstrations in a performance some analysts said indicated that the problematic program was turning a corner. 
COMAC's General Manager Zhao Yuerang told a news conference attended by Chinese government officials that the company now plans to deliver 100 ARJ-21 planes within the next five years. 
""We have smoothly passed the difficult teething period that every new plane model has to face,"" he said. 
NO-SHOWS
Some industry executives, however, said it was difficult to ignore some glaring holes in China's carefully orchestrated show of strength, noting attendance numbers appeared to have fallen. 
It took place in the same week as a Shanghai import expo, viewed as one of China's most important foreign policy events for the year. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported, citing military insiders, that organizers had scaled back the Zhuhai event due to trade tensions and reduced funding. 
There were also a number of no-shows among the range of domestic products that China was expected to put on display. 
In a separate report, the SCMP reported the WS-15 Emei engine for the J-20 fighter was not used as had been expected.
COMAC did not bring its banner product, the narrowbody C919, which has been in flight tests for over a year. COMAC officials said its two C919 planes were busy flight testing. 
A senior industry executive called this a deliberate ""PR strategy"" to focus attention on the CR929 and its wider political message of joint Chinese-Russian resilience to U.S. pressure. But others said it was hard to escape the narrower explanation that the program itself was under strain.

""This does not reflect terribly well for the country’s broader ambitions in this field,"" Tusa said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's big banks, long able to shrug off competition from start-ups, have been spooked by an account launched just six weeks ago by Goldman Sachs (N:GS) that pays savers more.
One of the banks admitted privately that it has seen a spike in savers switching, while others have launched new accounts or raised rates to try to nip ""Marcus"" in the bud.
British savers have got used to payouts of 1 percent or less thanks to rock-bottom central bank rates, but the launch of Marcus with a 1.5 percent rate on Sept. 27 has shaken things up.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""savings account"" hit a five-year peak in Britain in the week of the Marcus launch, a Reuters analysis of data from Google trends shows. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2DbEu6z)
""Yes we are worried about Marcus, we have seen significant outflows from our savings products although I question if they can keep growing at that speed,"" a senior executive at one of Britain's biggest lenders told Reuters.
Marcus has signed up 100,000 customers since its launch, its managing director Des McDaid told Reuters, adding that it wanted to put the lethargy in Britain's savings market on the agenda.
Since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been trying to attract mass-market deposits to fund its other activities. It launched Marcus, whose emphasis on a customer-friendly image and simplicity contrasts with public perceptions of Goldman Sachs as a pillar of the financial elite, in 2016 in the United States.
But while some such as Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and Nottingham Building Society matched Marcus after its British launch, most bank rates are still well below 1.5 percent.
A top executive at another of Britain's biggest banks said he was more worried about Marcus than other rivals because of the hefty financial firepower and institutional backing that Goldman Sachs provides as one of the biggest investment banks.
""We worry more about firms who start to play that already have capital... big, meaty players that can stay the course are more concerning than what's going on in a garage in Shoreditch,"" he said, referring to the London home of a number of start-ups.

Start-up digital-only banks like Monzo, Starling and Tandem have succeeded in attracting hundreds of thousands of users in Britain, but have yet to turn that into consistent profits.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 06:48AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian state bank secretly financed Rosneft sale after foreign buyers balked,"By Tatiana Voronova, Oksana Kobzeva and Dmitry Zhdannikov
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - It was billed as the deal that proved Russia remained open for business.
""I want to congratulate you"", Russian President Vladimir Putin told his trusted ally Igor Sechin, after greeting him with a warm handshake in the Kremlin in December, 2016.
Sechin had just announced the sale to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and giant commodity trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft, the state oil giant that he runs.
The 10.2 billion euro ($11.57 billion) privatization deal was designed to replenish Russia's coffers, depleted by falling energy prices and Western sanctions.
Some Russian officials hailed it as proof that despite growing political isolation from the West the country could still attract global investors.
But now, nearly two years after the sale was first announced, nine sources with knowledge of the transaction have told Reuters that VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, itself financed a large share of the acquisition, undermining the deal's stated aim to bring foreign money into the country.
Based on accounts from five of the sources, the value of the Russian loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund is around $6 billion.
VTB denied it issued a loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, called the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).
""VTB has not issued and is not planning to issue a loan to QIA to finance the acquisition.""
VTB data for September published by the Russian central bank showed that VTB loaned 434 billion roubles ($6.7 billion) for up to three years to unnamed foreign borrowers after having raised 350 billion roubles via loans from the central bank itself.
VTB's financial results, published on Nov. 8, showed that during the third quarter the volume of loans to its 10 biggest borrowers had gone up by 403 billion roubles, or approximately $6 billion.
VTB declined to comment on the transactions, and the central bank did not respond to questions.
The QIA declined to comment. The Kremlin did not comment. Rosneft did not respond to questions about the VTB loan to Qatar.
""EFFECTIVE"" PRIVATIZATION
Rosneft - the world's biggest listed oil company by output - is the jewel in Russia's corporate crown.
But with Russia under sanctions, and facing the prospect of more sanctions to come, Sechin faced an uphill task in finding buyers or creditors willing to risk their own money to acquire a stake in Rosneft.
The sanctions, imposed by the United States and European Union in the aftermath of Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, limit the access of Russian firms to international debt markets.
In the end, to get foreign investors on board, Russia has had to loan them billions, according to the sources' account. Two sources familiar with the deal said that having a third party finance a large part of the acquisition was a condition for Qatar taking the stake.
With oil prices today significantly higher than in late 2016, Russia's need for foreign money has subsided.
But should it need to tap international markets again, the story of the Rosneft sale points to the challenges it could face in bringing investors on board, especially as the United States levies more sanctions against Russia.
The nine sources who told Reuters about the VTB loan to Qatar included a source close to VTB management, a Russian central bank official and a Russian government source familiar with foreign investments in Russia.
At least four of the sources were directly involved in preparations for the loan. All the sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the deal.
In response to questions about how the privatization of its stake as a whole was conducted, Rosneft said the deal was market-based and transparent and in the interests of all shareholders.
It said all decisions relating to the deal underwent the relevant procedures for corporate approval, that the deal was supported by governments where participants are based, and was subject to compliance procedures in the relevant jurisdictions.
""This is a unique example of an effective privatization,"" Rosneft said in a statement.
FROM GULF TO JAPAN
As the end of 2016 drew nearer, Sechin, one of Putin's closest lieutenants, was under pressure. The government had publicly announced it would sell a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft by the end of the year.
The state budget, battered by a collapse in oil prices, an economic slump and the impact of Western sanctions, was showing a deficit of 3.5 percent. Russia's economy was in its second year of recession and there was no prospect of a quick improvement in public finances.
By the autumn, Sechin, who is now 58, thought he had a buyer: the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala.
According to two sources familiar with the developments, Mubadala agreed to buy the stake. But negotiations hit a snag after Rosneft twice changed the price tag, the two sources said, prompting the Emiratis to walk away from the deal.
Mubadala declined to comment. Rosneft did not address questions about the Mubadala discussions.
Sechin turned east and started talks with Japanese officials, according to a Russian government official, a source close to Rosneft and a recording of a conversation involving Sechin that emerged as part of an unrelated court case in which Sechin was a witness.
The talks were held primarily with the Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry minister, Hiroshige Seko.
If the deal was agreed, the owner of the stake would have become a large state Japanese investment fund such as GPIF, the government pension investment fund which has over $1.4 trillion assets under management, or state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC), three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
That deal also ran into difficulties, according to Sechin's account in the recording played in court, when Japan insisted on linking it to progress in a territorial dispute with Russia dating back to the end of World War Two.
Eventually, the deal collapsed.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not respond to questions. Rosneft did not address Reuters' questions about discussions with Japan. JOGMEC's press service said it could not comment. GPIF said it could not comment on a discussion between governments because it was not directly involved.
QATAR TO THE RESCUE?
Still without a buyer, Sechin focused on two new potential suitors: Qatar's investment fund QIA and global commodities trader Glencore.
Neither was prepared to put up all of the asking price, according to three sources.
In the past, Rosneft had gone to major Western banks, such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JP Morgan, to finance transactions, but the big international lenders have announced no major new loan deals with Rosneft since sanctions were imposed in 2014.
In stepped  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), a mid-sized Italian lender which had little experience in large Russian corporate deals.
By early December, 2016, financing for the deal was falling into place. The buyers put in some of their own money: Qatar gave 2.5 billion euros and Glencore 300 million euros.
The rest was debt, of which Intesa put up 5.2 billion euros. The balance, according to Glencore at the time, would come from unnamed Russian banks.
The amount coming from the Russian banks was about $2.5 billion. Two banking sources close to Rosneft told Reuters that VTB was one of the banks that between them put up $2.5 billion in loans back in 2016.
Those sources said the other Russian banks involved were Gazprombank and Otkritie, which, like VTB, have Kremlin connections, although Otkritie was privately held at the time.
It is not clear what share of the $2.5 billion each of the three banks contributed.
That contribution from VTB toward the $2.5 billion was separate to around $6 billion that, according to the nine sources, VTB provided to Qatar this year.
In response to questions about the initial $2.5 billion in loans, VTB said it did not provide financing but it was the coordinating bank on behalf of Rosneft.
Otkritie declined to comment. Gazprombank did not respond to questions.
For the larger portion of the financing -- the 5.2 billion euros loaned by Intesa -- the Italian bank's intention was to syndicate the loan, a common industry practice designed to spread the risk and dilute the burden on the bank's own capital.
But two banking sources and a source familiar with the Italian side of the deal said the syndication failed because European banks approached by Intesa were worried about the risk that providing finance for Rosneft, even if indirectly, would result in them falling foul of Western sanctions on Russia.
Rosneft and Sechin are both subject to U.S. sanctions.
Intesa declined to comment.
ANOTHER SETBACK
At the time of the December 2016 announcement and in the weeks afterwards, Russian officials spoke publicly of a long-term partnership with the new Rosneft shareholders, Qatar and Glencore.
But it became clear that the agreement was still in flux when, in September 2017, Sechin said a deal had been signed for Chinese energy firm CEFC to buy 14.2 percent of Rosneft from Qatar and Glencore.
Explaining why the original deal had not stuck, he told Russian state television the new shareholders were finding the cost of servicing the debt too high.
The Chinese deal though, was never closed. Before it was sealed, CEFC's founder and chairman Ye Jianming was taken in for questioning and investigated by Chinese authorities for suspected economic crimes. 
Since then there has been no word on the status of the investigation, or if Ye has been charged. He was named, however, in a high-profile graft trial of a senior Communist Party official, state broadcaster CCTV reported last month.
Neither Ye nor CEFC responded to calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Once again, Sechin was in search of a buyer.
Finally, in May this year, Qatar agreed to take on the part of the stake that had been covered by Intesa. 
Officially, no one has said how the new deal with Qatar is being financed, or who is providing the finance.
It is clear that Intesa’s role has ended. 
A document dated Sept. 6, 2018 and lodged with Singapore's official business register, where the vehicle that held the stake on behalf of Qatar and Glencore is registered, stated that Intesa had ceased to be the creditor for the stake and no longer held shares as collateral.
The document did not state who was the new creditor. According to the nine sources familiar with the arrangement, that new creditor is VTB. 
At a reception at the Italian embassy in Moscow last November to receive an award ""for services to Italy"", Sechin, champagne glass in hand, linked arms with a grey-haired Russian man in fashionable glasses.

It was Andrey Kostin, the chief executive of the bank that helped to finance the privatization – Russia's VTB.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Friday, joining a global market retreat that spread from Wall Street to Asia after the Federal Reserve appeared to remain on track to raise its key interest rate next month.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.5 percent at 0930 GMT, while the leading index of euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) was 0.7 percent lower. 
All European bourses and most sectors were in negative territory with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) losing 0.7 percent.
""Just as the feel-good factor was beginning to return to the markets, buoyed by the result of the U.S. midterms, the Fed swooped in and brought everyone back down to earth"", Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note.
Some investors had hoped that the sharp share price falls during what has been called ""Red October"" might have encouraged the U.S. central bank to take a more dovish approach toward monetary policy.
A number of disappointing corporate earnings in Europe weighed on the market mood, as Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) fell to its lowest levels since July 2016 after cutting its profit outlook for the second time this year.
The steel-to-submarines conglomerate, under a cartel probe, cut its profit outlook for the second time this year, adding to a string of bad news for the group.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp fell about 8 percent, its biggest fall in about two years and weighed on the Basic Resources sector (SXPP), down 2.35 percent and hit by lower metals prices. 
Thyssenkrupp was the STOXX 600's second-worst performance, behind France's  Rubis  (PA:RUBF). 
The French oil storage and distribution group led losers with a 14 percent fall after a disappointing trading update and brokers lowered their recommendation for the stock.
The energy sector also acted as a drag with oil majors weighing on indexes as rising supply and concerns of an economic slowdown pressured prices, with U.S. crude down by around 20 percent since early October.
Another blow for investors was luxury goods group  Richemont  (S:CFR), which fell 5.8 pct after it said first-half net profit fell and sales growth slowed toward the end of the period. 
The results knocked Swiss peer Swatch (S:UHR), which fell 4.1 percent, and French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the worst performer among the 40 constituents of Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) with a 3 percent decline. 
Italian state-controlled defense group Leonardo (MI:LDOF) was another big loser, tumbling 7.7 percent after a disappointing trading update.
The euro zone banking sector (SX7E) was also deep in the red, down 2 percent. 

The euro and euro zone bond yields were pushed lower after the head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi said late on Thursday that the bank could change its monetary policy guidance if the economic outlook darkens.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Agribusiness giant ADM made buyout approach to Argentina's,"By Hugh Bronstein and Jonathan Saul
BUENOS AIRES/LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) has approached Argentine soy crusher  Molinos Agro  (BA:MOLA) about buying the company's livestock feed and soyoil manufacturing plant, and talks may continue, three sources said.
Molinos and other Argentine soy crushers have been pummeled by fallout from the U.S.-China trade policy war which has given U.S. crushers a competitive advantage. 
The discussions began last year and then stalled over the price that ADM would pay for Molinos, a Buenos Aires-based industry source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. 
ADM declined to comment. 
A spokesman for the Perez Companc business group, which controls Molinos Agro, said the company had been approached ""several times"" by potential buyers. Without mentioning ADM in particular, the spokesman said ""the offers were rejected.""
It was unclear how much Molinos, controlled by the Perez Companc business group, was valued at during the negotiations.
""ADM backed off because of the asking price,"" the Buenos Aires-based industry source said. ""There were differences in the valuation of the company. But it is logical that ADM could be back knocking on the door of Molinos.""
The Argentine company reported 665.9 million pesos ($18.5 million) in net earnings for the April through September period.
Company results could be pressured by tensions over global trade policy in the months ahead, the source said. ""Next year will be a great year for buying soy crushing companies in Argentina, and a bad year for selling them,"" the source added. 
Argentine crushers are working at about half capacity while U.S. crushers are reaping the benefits of low soy prices after China slapped a 25-percent import tariff on U.S. beans. The Perez Companc group has taken a ""conservative"" stance toward ADM's overtures and has shown no eagerness to sell, the source said. Two separate international industry sources with knowledge of the situation said exploratory talks between ADM and Molinos had taken place this year. ""Argentina is a key focus for ADM and they need assets there,"" one said. ""ADM will seek to take advantage of its strong position by taking over a major Argentine crushing operation that is being squeezed by the trade war,"" another added. An ADM-Molinos combination would be in line with recent consolidation of the sector which has wrestled with a global oversupply of grains and oilseeds.
The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has reordered trade flows across the global grains sector, affecting companies like ADM,  Bunge  (N:BG), Cargill Inc [CARGIL.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL], which together are known as the “ABCDs” and dominate the industry.
The trade policy dispute between the world's two largest economies has driven down U.S. soybean prices, which in turn has helped fuel profits for U.S. soybean processors. ADM reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit this week, cashing in on strong oilseed crushing margins. [nL4N1XH42N]
CRUSHING CAPACITY 
ADM is the only one of the ""ABCDs"" that has no crushing capacity in Argentina. The company's chief financial offer Ray Young said this week the group may look at mergers and acquisitions in general if a deal made sense.
ADM earlier this year made a takeover approach for Bunge.
Crushing plants that dot the banks of the Parana River, Argentina's main grains thoroughfare, are seeking to revive their business with a deal that would permit them for the first time to export soymeal livestock feed to China. [nL2N1XH1QT]
China generally imports beans to be crushed on the mainland, but with trade tension rising with Washington, Beijing may want to lock in alternative supplies. The U.S.-China conflict, which has shifted global commodity trade routes and distorted prices, is not the only factor ailing Argentine crushers. 

Earlier this year the sector was hit by a drought on the Pampas farm belt that shriveled soybean supplies. But over the long-term, with demand growing for soymeal feed needed for China's massive pork sector, soy crushing along the Parana may thrive again. Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal and soyoil, used for cooking and making biodiesel. The nation's massive soy crushers and grains elevators are sandwiched between the Pampas and the deeply dredged Parana. The set-up offers logistical advantages over main competitors Brazil and the United States, where moving grains involves more costly ground transportation and loading products on and off barges. Molinos was formed in 1902 as a unit of Bunge. It was sold to the Perez Companc group in 1999. The company's main crushing facility is in San Lorenzo, on the Parana. It has a nominal crushing capacity of 20,000 tonnes of soy per day.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 04:38AM ET</span>",Stocks poised for biggest drop in two weeks on U.S. and China concerns,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks were heading for their biggest drop in two weeks and emerging market currencies also slipped on Friday as a confident U.S. central bank and weak Chinese data hit demand for risky assets.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) fell half a percent, its biggest drop since Oct. 26, as the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates as expected but indicated that another rate increase is likely in December.
While the decision to hold rates was anticipated by markets, some participants had expected a more cautious approach from the central bank after a stock market rout in October.
But the Fed indicated a December increase is a distinct possibility in a robust economy. That contrasts sharply with China, where cooling producer price inflation and falling car sales suggested an economy struggling to gain traction.
""Worries about trade wars and how the slowdown in China will impact the rest of the world mean stocks appear to be more risky, so there's a typical risk-off move in markets today,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist Pascal Segesser. 
Stocks in Hong Kong and China were the main losers in Asia, where a financial sector sub-index <.CSI300FS> fell more than 2 percent after China's banking watchdog told lenders to allocate at least a third of new loans to private companies, raising the prospects of a jump in bad assets.
European stocks followed Asia lower, with main indexes opening in the red, though a batch of company earnings and UK GDP data might offer some support later in the session.
MSCI's main European index <.MSER> was down nearly 1 percent and the broader Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent.
A confident Fed also gave a boost to the dollar, which had weakened sharply after mid-term elections this week raised the prospects of U.S. political gridlock. The greenback gained a quarter of a percent against the euro (EUR=EBS) and half a percent against the British pound.  
The dollar index measuring the currency against its six major rivals (DXY) gained 0.25 percent to 96.86.
Losses in equities pressured bond yields lower, with safe-haven benchmark debt in Germany and the United States softening across the board, pressured by world trade frictions and a budget standoff between Italy and Brussels.
Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand from of lower economic growth and trade disputes.
Benchmark Brent (LCOc1) crude oil fell to its lowest since early April, down more than 18 percent since reaching four-year highs at the beginning of October. 
The sturdy dollar tarnished the appetite for safe-haven gold , with the price down 0.2 percent at $1221.42 an ounce.
Still, market watchers said appetite for equities is likely to remain firm unless there is a big sell-off in credit markets or a spike in volatility.
An ETF (HYG) tracking the performance of high-yield debt consolidated near three-week highs while gauges of volatility edged lower after a spike earlier this week.
""As long as these two indicators are not flashing red, stock markets should remain supported,"" said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services in London.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - U.S. firm CTI Africa plans to invest $10 million in Uganda to build a plant to assemble low-end smart mobile phones and manufacture phone components, its chief executive said on Friday.
CTI says it is focused on digital technology to bring affordable solutions in sectors like agriculture, energy, healthcare and finance to rural communities in Africa.
CEO Michael Landau told Reuters in an interview on Friday the company plans to build the plant in the capital Kampala and to eventually manufacture elsewhere in the country.
""From a realistic perspective we are hoping to be able to start delivering the phones in the early first quarter of 2019,"" Landau told Reuters. 
""We need to be manufacturing millions of phones ...the cost of developing a building that can handle that sort of value is going be in the $10 million range."" 
There are more than 20 million mobile phone subscribers in Uganda, where the sector is dominated by a unit of South Africa's MTN Group (J:MTNJ) and a subsidiary of India's  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI). 
Wooed by economic stability, a young population and strong growth, foreign investment has flowed into Uganda's IT sector over the last two decades.
Fast growing internet use has drawn Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) who have investments in the country's high-speed internet infrastructure. 
The sector now directly employs about one million people and accounts for around 2.5 percent of the East African country's GDP, according to government estimates.
Landau told Reuters CTI Africa's planned investment is a result of a pilot project in a small community in central Uganda.
In the pilot, CTI Africa tested the idea of harvesting personal health, financial, energy, agricultural and other personal data that the firm can then use to connect those individuals with potential providers of services and products. 
The smartphone handsets that CTI Africa will assemble, under the brand name LifeMobile, will operate on Android and users can download standard apps from the system's Play Store.
But the LifeMobile handsets will have in-built, customized applications that users can tap into to access providers of a range of services and products such loans, renewable energy and healthcare, e-commerce and others. 
CTI is in discussions with some financial institutions to help provide hire purchase deals to customers, Landau said, adding it was also in talks with several other African countries about similar investments.

A net 1,123 stores disappeared from Britain's top 500 high streets in the first half of the year as only 1,589 shops opened, compared to 2,682 closures, PwC said.
A string of UK retailers has failed or announced plans to close shops.
Toys R Us UK and electronics retailer Maplin went into administration this year, while department store chain House of Fraser was rescued by  Sports Direct  (LON:SPD), and stalwarts such as Marks & Spencer and Debenhams have announced closures.
PwC said the hardest hit retail categories were fashion stores and electrical outlets, both of which have seen a shift to online spending.
Pubs have been impacted by people buying drink in supermarkets to consume at home, and restaurants are struggling to deal with cost inflation and oversupply after rapid expansion in recent years, it said.
Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said the turmoil facing the sector was unlikely to abate.
""The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home,"" she said.

""Openings simply aren't replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across 'experiential' chains, such as ice cream parlors, beauty salons and vape shops, haven't been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.""

ZHUHAI, China/LONDON (Reuters) - British electronics manufacturing company  TT Electronics  (L:TTG) is hoping its first attendance at China's biggest air show with support from UK authorities will help it land a front-seat role in the production of the world's next wide-body jet. 
The Woking-based company is in the vanguard of British companies scouting for business in China this week as part of a charm offensive sponsored by the British government, four months before Britain is due to exit the European Union.
Its interest has been piqued by plans for a wide-body jet to be developed jointly by China and Russia, who unveiled the first life-sized model of their CR929 at Airshow China in a bid to break open the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""If the next twin-aisle aircraft is going to be a Chinese aircraft, we either get involved or we forget about China's market of twin-aisle for the next 10-15 years,"" Ben Fox, business development manager at TT Electronics, told Reuters.
The maker of sensors for planes, trains and hybrid vehicles supplies parts for the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350. But few major new projects are on the horizon and competition is cut-throat in the $800 billion aerospace parts industry.
Britain's Department for International Trade for the first time set up a UK presence at Zhuhai's air show, leading a team of seven mostly small and medium-sized companies in the hopes of tapping into China's rising manufacturing ambitions.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain wants a free trade agreement with China, as it tries to reinvent itself as a global trading nation after the 2016 Brexit referendum. 
The air show coincided with a trade expo in Shanghai where Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to import more amid mounting frictions with the United States and others.
STERLING DROP
Zhuhai's UK Pavilion ""is a demonstration to our Chinese host that we are serious. We put in quite a considerable sum of money to support this and that's government money,"" said Andrew Massey, deputy director for China in the aerospace and aviation division of the Department for International Trade.
Many companies face uncertainty about post-Brexit trade relations with continental Europe, a major outlet for UK-made aerospace parts, and the status of regulation after Brexit. 
""There is an element of Brexit forcing people to broaden their horizons which brings opportunity,"" said Paul Adams, head of aerospace at consultancy Vendigital.
Britain has the world's second largest aerospace industry after the United States and is anxious to tout skills and knowledge. 
Tangerine, a London-based consultancy that has worked with British Airways, helped design interiors for the CR929 display.
Massey said British companies have also been helping the Chinese to fast-track the FAA/EASA certification process for its smaller C919 jet, which did not appear at this week's show.
But their trump card may be an 11 percent drop in the value of sterling against the dollar since the 2016 Brexit vote, which has added a hard-nosed dimension to Britain's global sales drive.
One small British aerospace supplier told Reuters that even though it already sold in 55 countries, the Brexit referendum served as a wake-up call to push for more global markets.

""We’ve done nine exhibitions this year. Brexit is something that will happen and business will get round it but from our point of view we’ve done our first exhibition in Japan and China this year and that’s been very successful, and we’re pushing for markets around the world.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - German car maker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) signed what looked like a meaty deal with one of its China joint ventures this week at a huge new trade show in Shanghai to ship almost $9 billion worth of cars and parts to China next year.
But it turns out the ""Memorandum of Cooperation"", one of hundreds of deals inked at the China International Import Expo that wraps up on Saturday, represents business as usual for VW.
Two sources close to the company and its FAW-Volkswagen tie-up said the joint venture would have imported the cars and parts with or without the expo to support its day-to-day manufacturing and sales operations, as it does every year. FAW-Volkswagen did not have an immediate comment.
While the giant import fair is a key part of China's response to growing complaints about its commercial policies, critics said the tightly choreographed event was more show than substance that failed to address core issues at the heart of the festering U.S.-China trade war.
""I don't think we're holding out high hopes for the expo in terms of improving China's trade relationship with the rest of the world,"" said Duncan Innes-Ker, regional director for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
""People really want to see a generalized improvement in the fairness of the operating environment, not a specific commitment to importing more in this particular year or whatever.""
State media has lavished praise on the event, which was headlined by President Xi Jinping, who provided few specifics in his opening speech about how China would address complaints on issues like market access and intellectual property rights protection.
""The Shanghai expo will act as a demonstration before billions of global observers that China is letting the market play the decisive role in its business operations,"" the Global Times newspaper said.
The expo's organizers were less laissez faire, and the heavy hand of the state, from stifling security to pressure on state-owned enterprises to do deals, was ever-present.
Schools were closed across Shanghai, a city of more than 24 million people, on the first two days of the expo and cars without special passes were blocked from approaching the enormous clover-shaped exhibition hall.
Inside, guards and police blanketed the venue and lined walkways to and from the subway. Participants were required to undergo airport-level security and a long list of items, from daggers to Frisbees, were banned.
""I'm not sure what they are trying to protect with all of this security,"" one foreign industry VIP said.
Hundreds of student volunteers in red blazers offered directions around the venue, which boasts an exhibition area roughly the size of 40 football pitches and a multi-story maze of roads, meeting rooms, offices and restaurants.
One Reuters journalist clocked more than 17,000 steps of walking at the expo in one day, or roughly 12 km.
ACTORS AND OLD DEALS
Many of the deals touted at the fair, like Volkswagen's, appeared to be either business agreements that would not ordinarily warrant publicity, or the announcement of previously agreed contracts, according to executives. 
After one signing, a foreign participant told Reuters that he had nothing to do with the company he was representing.
""Everything you saw at the signing ceremony was theater or farce. I'm essentially an actor, hired for the duration of the expo, in order to give the impression of international cooperation,"" the person said, asking not to be named.
Chinese companies have been known to hire foreigners to impersonate executives at events, presumably to lend an air of international legitimacy.
On Wednesday at the expo, China's state-run offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd signed 20 deals with foreign businesses, including Siemens ,  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and Schlumberger (N:SLB).
Two people involved in the signings said the deals were non-binding ""memoranda of understanding"", or letters of intent, with existing partners. CNOOC executives declined to provide details.
Merck Group's (DE:MRCG) CEO for performance materials, Kai Beckmann, said deals aren't everything.
""For us as a global company, any signal that promotes free trade and global collaboration is highly appreciated and welcome, and this platform was used for that purpose,"" he said.
""In the old days, these kinds of exhibitions and trade fairs were used to sign deals. But now you do the deals through e-commerce and you don't need trade fairs for that.""
The strategy for some of the more than 180 American companies at the expo seemed to be to wait and see.
""We will continue to do what we are doing and hopefully that will resolve itself between both of our governments,"" said Henry Irizarry, a vice president at Jeanerette, Louisiana-based Metal Shark Boats, referring to the China-U.S. trade war.
At the media center, a robot on wheels named 'Xiao Bao', or Little Leopard, scooted to and fro, showing reporters to the bathroom and answering basic questions.
Asked where Xi Jinping was, Xiao Bao could give a rundown of news of the day involving the Chinese leader.

It was unable to respond when asked multiple times how the China-U.S. trade conflict could be resolved.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's new ultra-luxurious Iconsiam shopping complex opens its doors on Saturday, shrugging off a decline in tourist arrivals and political uncertainty ahead of next year's elections. 
""I wanted to build something that would tell the million stories of 'Thainess',"" says Chadatip Chutrakul, chief executive of Siam Piwat, the firm behind Iconsiam, a half-million-square meter (sqm) complex sits on the banks of Bangkok's Chao Praya River.
The retail sector is a rare bright spot in Thailand where the economy lags regional peers, even while growing at 4.6 percent.
Developers have $4 billion in retail investments in the pipeline, outstripping new projects in Jakarta, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. 
Retail sales growth reached a five-year high in August this year, up 17 percent from a year ago, much of it in malls.
(Thai retail sales growth: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QsTPUj) 
This growth may be the dominant factor in Chadatip's rock-solid confidence. Bangkok is expected to add more retail floor space than any city in Southeast Asia this year. 
Siam Piwat’s malls at the center of Bangkok's shopping district were closed off at the height of civil unrest that ultimately led to Thailand's 2014 military coup.
""There were mobs in front of our shopping centers...we closed for three months - I survived,"" she said in an interview with Reuters. ""We announced [Iconsiam] three weeks after the coup."" 
New retail projects are being planned even as Thailand prepares for elections that senior government officials have said would likely be on Feb. 24.
The elections will pit supporters of the military and royalist establishment against populist political forces led by the Puea Thai Party that was ousted by the military in a 2014 coup. 
Thailand's political turmoil discouraged tourism growth, which also slowed after a boat accident killed dozens of Chinese tourists in July, but these concerns have not deterred developers. 
Siam Piwat's Chadatip says she believes there are good opportunities in Thailand and tourism will recover.

MORE CLICKS WITH BRICKS
Even e-commerce in Thailand is turning to malls. JD.com-backed (O:JD) fashion retailer Pomelo saw an untapped customer segment after experimenting with pop-up stores, said CEO David Jou. 
""We found that some customers didn't feel comfortable making their first purchase online, but liked our products."" 
The Bangkok-based startup, which has its fifth store in Iconsiam, where e-commerce is growing, says physical stores familiarize customers with products before they place digital orders. 
Shops create brand recognition and double as a pick-up point for online orders, simplifying logistics, he said. 
SHOPPING BUT NOT SPENDING 
But with mammoth retail developments going up and Thai household debt at 77.6 percent of GDP, some are questioning the sustainability of recreational shopping. ""People like going to malls...but are they purchasing goods?"" asks Adithep Vanabriksha, Chief Investment Officer at Aberdeen Asset Management (Thailand). Bangkok currently has 7.5 million sqm of retail space with another million in planned, nearly double what similar cities have lined up. 
This breakneck expansion risks creating a supply glut such as seen in Kuala Lumpur and when foot traffic through malls doesn't lead to sales, Thai retailers and developers are already working together to boost spending.
Pomelo is looking into partnerships with stores to tap into customer loyalty programs. 
There must be data-sharing on footfall and spending between landlords and tenants, which will require big investments in data analytics, says James Pitchon, Executive Director of real estate consulting firm CBRE in Bangkok, noting that ""retail's not dead, but it's very complicated"". 
CHANGING UP THE MIX
Another retail approach is to harness the convenience of the mixed-use project. 
One Bangkok, a venture of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s Fraser Property (SI:FRPL) and TCC Asset’s $3.5 billion, will devote half of its 1.83 million sqm development to offices, a quarter for retail, and the remainder for hotels and attractions. 
""We already have a captive population right there,"" Su Lin Soon, CEO (Development) of One Bangkok told Reuters in an interview. 
Infrastructure investments and a government policy that draws in foreign investors will also benefit the project, which is expected to complete its first phase in 2022, Soon adds. 
LA Staples-owner AEG and the Mall Group also announced $300 million in ventures including a 16,000 seat entertainment and retail complex. 

The challenge to Thailand's retail success is keeping shopping center visits engaging and fresh, says CBRE's Pitchon. ""You need a reason to go...and it has to be a unique experience. Is it instagram-able?""

65,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",India clears sale of 'enemy shares' held by people who moved to Pakistan,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government said it will sell stocks worth millions of dollars seized from people who moved to Pakistan following partition in 1947 and the wars since, as a way to make up for a shortfall in revenues.
The stocks worth at least 30 billion rupees ($412.26 million) are part of what India calls ""enemy properties"" that once belonged to people who went to Pakistan and China, with which India also fought a war. 
Once these Indian nationals became citizens of these two countries, they were treated as ""enemies"" and their assets in India including land and houses as well as shares were seized and held by the Custodian of Enemy Property of India. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been tightening the provisions of the Enemy Property Act 1968 to include even lawful heirs who stayed behind and were Indian citizens.
Modi's cabinet on Thursday approved a plan to sell stocks in 996 companies held by 20,323 shareholders, deemed as ""enemy shares"" the government said in a statement. The government said 588 were active firms including 139 listed on the stock exchange. 
""The decision will lead to monetization of enemy shares that had been lying dormant for decades since coming into force and the Enemy Property Act in 1968,"" it said. 
Those who left India for Pakistan were Muslims, and relations between the two countries remain fraught after numerous conflicts. Pakistan enacted a similar law at the time and seized properties of those who left for India.
The Indian government's move comes as it is casting around for funds to support welfare programs in the final months before a national election in the summer of 2019. 
It is also struggling to meet its target of raising a record 1 trillion rupees ($14.25 billion) from the sale of state assets in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019.
The government said the proceeds from the sale of stocks held under enemy assets would be treated as part of the divestment proceeds.
""The government will gain from the sales of enemy shares and the proceeds will be used for development and social welfare of our people,"" said federal law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 02:53AM ET</span>","In China, response to pledged share meltdown stirs concern","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Scores of Chinese brokers and banks are struggling under the weight of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to companies using their own plummeting shares as collateral.
Southwest Securities, a Chinese securities broker based in Chongqing, said last month in its quarterly earnings report it had to set aside the equivalent of 80 percent of its profits through September to provide for likely losses because of such loans.
Southwest and its peers are caught in the slow-motion collapse in China of pledged share financing, in which companies' major shareholders provide shares as collateral for loans. The practice boomed last year amid a crackdown on shadow banking, but now, as share prices collapse and collateral withers, creditors are suffering.
About $620 billion worth of traded Chinese shares, or 10 percent of total market capitalization, has been pledged, mostly by small and medium-sized companies, which have been hit hardest by a slowing economy and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
As key stock indexes fell 20 percent this year, Chinese authorities urged brokers not to unload shares held as collateral. Listed companies were told not to suspend trading of their stock.
Although authorities are pushing local governments, brokerages, insurers and fund houses to inject cash into listed companies, the losses could deepen. 
""If you want to put out a fire, you should separate the burning barns from the rest,"" said Yuan Yuwei, a partner and portfolio manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management.
During the first nine months of 2018, China's 32 listed brokerages set aside funds for credit losses of more than $1 billion, double that of the previous year, according to their quarterly reports. As defaults rose in loans backed by pledged shares, listed brokerages reported a 50 percent slump in third-quarter profit.
Southwest (SS:600369) reported a 62 percent decline in net profit for the third quarter excluding extraordinary items.
It also disclosed a lengthy list of legal disputes involving pledged shares and defaulting borrowers such as jewelry products maker Eastern  Gold Jade  Co (SS:600086), electronic vision company Jiang Su Proturly Vision Technology Group (SS:600074) and Guangdong Golden Glass Technologies (SZ:300093).
Yuan is worried that government pressure is only creating more risk. 
""Now, the government is connecting all the barns,"" Yuan said. ""If risks spread further into the financial system, a match box could morph into an atomic bomb.""
(Smaller firms more exposed to pledged share risks: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NTiZJC) 
DEATH SPIRAL
The crisis has brought Pang Da Automobile Trade Co (SS:601258), a car dealer once dubbed China's ""King of Dealerships,"" to its knees.
As Pang Da's shares fell 40 percent and lenders called for more collateral, its founder and biggest shareholder, Pang Qinghua, had to pledge his entire 20 percent stake. 
He borrowed from China Minsheng Banking Corp (SS:600016) and Bank of Communications (SS:601328), among others, according to regulatory filings.
Pang Da once prided itself on distributing more than 70 auto brands - the most in China. But now it is selling dealerships. 
The group, which has more than 1,000 outlets across China and employs about 30,000 workers, sold five Mercedes-Benz dealerships in May to a rival, and in August sold another nine that distribute brands including Lexus, Subaru and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
This month, a court froze Pang's stake in the cash-strapped company in a funding dispute. 
""Each and every day, we're discussing how we can overcome the current crisis,"" Pang, also a vice president of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), said in a rare public acknowledgement of the company's woes published by CADA last month.
A Pang Da executive, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said regulators had recently told creditors not to seek repayment to help the dealership wade through the crisis.
That is in line with government calls for financial institutions to tolerate more risks when a private borrower runs into temporary funding trouble. 
But Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, doubts Pang Da's headache is temporary. 
""The problem seems to be chronic,"" Zhang said, citing China's decelerating car market and a slowing economy.
Han Changming, founder of a rival auto dealer based in southern Fujian Province, put it more bluntly: ""Winter is ahead. I think it (Pang Da) is taking its last breath."" 
Pang Da didn't return requests for an interview. CADA declined to comment. 
(Chinese brokerages' credit loss provisions: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PjDG6S) 
TRANSMISSION
Banks, which account for an estimated 70 percent of pledged share financing, haven't spelled out loss provisions for that side of the business, which represents a much smaller portion of their overall lending.
Those more clearly hurt by loss-making pledged share lending include brokerages such as First Capital Securities, Western Securities and Founder Securities.
Southwest suffered a 242 million yuan ($34.9 million) loss in collateral value. Citic Securities, China's biggest securities broker, set aside 1.2 billion yuan to cover credit losses from January to September. 
Answering calls from China's top leaders, mainland brokerages, insurers and local governments have over the past few weeks committed more than 500 billion yuan to ""relief funds"" to ease pledged share risks by buying stock in companies facing margin calls. And the list of such programs, framed as market-oriented, keeps growing. 
Investors, meanwhile, are worried about government-backed funds' propping up private companies.
""The risk is delayed, but not defused. Because the shares that are underwater are still on brokers' balance sheets,"" said Hong Hao, chief strategist at BOCOM International. 
According to UBS Securities, earnings for companies listed on Shenzhen's SME board and ChiNext - home to roughly half of pledged shares - declined by 2.8 percent, and 11.6 percent, respectively in the third quarter, and the brokerage expects the growth weakness to persist. 
""The risk stems from share price volatility that can cause a margin call, and a potential forced liquidation,"" said Alexious Lee, strategist at CLSA. 
Using the start-up board ChiNext (CHINEXTP) to illustrate such risks, he estimates that if the index falls below 1,200 points, about 10 percent off the current level, a fresh wave of 1.5 trillion yuan worth of pledged shares could trigger calls for their companies to provide more collateral.
Markets have stabilized this month, but Yang Xiaofan, general manager at Wendaotianxia Investment Co, a hedge fund manager, said it's too early to declare the crisis over.
""The pledged share 'death spiral' is a long-term process that will keep squeezing cash flow of listed firms' major shareholders,"" he said. ""And many over-pledged, cash-strapped small-caps are already toxic assets."" 
Developer Zhonghong Holdings (SZ:000979), one-fifth of whose stock is pledged against loans, was delisted by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange after its shares traded below face value for more than 20 consecutive days. 
That sent the value of its pledged shares to near zero, hurting creditors, who must write off their loans to Zhonghong as losses. 
CLSA estimates that another 60 to 100 Chinese stocks are in danger of being delisted.
Wang Qian, banking professor at Tongji University and a chartered financial risk manager, warned that if money is thrown at struggling companies whose shares are still expensive, risk could metastasize. 

""If you look at the current scale and seriousness of the pledged share issue, plus the backdrop of the trade war ... you cannot rule out the possibility of systemic financial risk,"" Wang said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is gearing up for the biggest shopping event of the year on Sunday, a day dominated by e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) which saw $25 billion worth of goods sold on its platforms alone in the 24-hour period last year.
Akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, ""Singles' Day"" has become something of a litmus test for the strength of Chinese consumption, which is coming under pressure amid rising trade Sino-U.S. tensions and a wider economic slowdown.
Companies in China are already seeing the effect of rising caution among the country's shoppers. Car sales are down sharply this year, box office receipts have slowed and brands are facing pressure to roll out discounts to prop up sales.
Alibaba itself lowered its full-year sales forecast earlier this month due to concerns about the trade spat, while the firm's core commerce business saw its slowest quarterly sales growth since 2016.
As such, China's leaders in Beijing, global firms targeting the market and e-commerce giants like Alibaba and major rival JD.com Inc (O:JD) are all paying close attention to Singles' Day for wider signs of consumer strength.
""BAROMETER"" FOR CONSUMPTION
The focus on Singles' Day will be Alibaba's final transaction number, which comes out just after midnight following a frenzied day of deal hunting for shoppers and brands looking to bolster their sales.
Most analysts said the number will rise, but the speed of growth will temper. The value of transactions, which includes pre-orders made weeks ahead of the event, rose 40 percent last year from the year earlier.
""It's definitely one of the barometers of consumer confidence,"" said Jason Yu, Shanghai-based General Manager of market researcher Kantar Worldpanel, adding Beijing policymakers would be keeping a watchful eye.
For many brands ""this is probably the single biggest sales contributor for the entire year,"" he said.

China's shoppers, on a tear in 2017, have been spooked this year by falling stock markets, a protracted trade war with the United States and wider economic malaise.
A range of consumer indexes, including from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and brokerage Jefferies, have shown a drop off in confidence this year as credit conditions and trade tensions have hardened.

BOX OFFICE FLOP
China's box office dropped almost 30 percent in October, its steepest fall in over two years, according to data from domestic industry tracker EntGroup. That was also a third straight month of declining sales versus 2017.
""I haven't been to the cinema for over a month,"" said Ji Chunzi, 26, a Shanghai-based trade publication editor, who said it was due to a lack of good films and that tickets had become a bit pricey at 50 yuan to 60 yuan ($7.20 to $8.64) each.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) won vindication of its decision to fight accusations its conduct in handling of a key rate was unconscionable as an Australian court fined it A$3.3 million ($2.4 million), far less than the sum sought by a regulator.
A federal court judge largely cleared Westpac in May of accusations it interfered with negotiations for an important internal price-setting measure called the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), but said its actions still amounted to unconscionable conduct. 
The bank and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) have since been haggling in court over Westpac's fine, and on Friday the judge rejected the regulator's argument that the bank be made to pay A$58 million.
""I have to apply the law as it was at the time, not what it should have been,"" the judge, Jonathan Beach, wrote in his judgment.
The relatively small penalty for the A$95 billion market capitalization company brings a rare bright spot to an industry facing a daily drumbeat of negative publicity as a public inquiry into financial misconduct grinds on. 
The inquiry has also drawn criticism about the effectiveness of Australia's financial regulators, putting pressure on ASIC to show it can rein in the industry.
For the BBSW case, ASIC brought lawsuits against all of the country's Big Four lenders alleging they rigged the rate but Westpac was the only one of the four to defend the case. 
The other three, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB), agreed to settle before the matter went to hearings, and pay fines totaling A$125 million.
Justice Beach said ASIC's argument that Westpac should pay A$58 million for 58 instances of wrongdoing had ""all the irreconcilable atonality of a Schoenberg composition"", an apparent reference to the 20th century expressionist composer Arnold Schoenberg.

A Westpac spokesman declined to comment on Friday. An ASIC statement quoted Commissioner Cathie Armour welcoming the decision, and saying: ""ASIC's actions have led to these successful court outcomes, and also contributed to new benchmark manipulation offences being enacted by Parliament"".

71,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 01:58AM ET</span>",SEC to review corporate democracy rules risking investor clash,"By Ross Kerber and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is set to review this month rules on corporate democracy, setting it up for a clash with investors who worry the agency will side with companies to diminish voting rights on charged issues like climate change and gun violence. 
On Nov. 15, the Securities and Exchange Commission will hold a roundtable on the 'proxy process' by which big pension funds and other shareholders can force companies to vote on a range of environmental, social and governance matters.
For over a decade, corporate America has complained that voting rules have allowed special interests and proxy advisory firms that recommend how investors should vote to hijack corporate boardrooms with costly demands.
The SEC has heard out corporate concerns in the past, but has not pursued changes to rein in shareholder proposals, which have taken on a higher profile since the financial crisis as a mechanism for corporate oversight. Business groups are hoping this time is different with a business-friendly administration in power, while investors gear up for a battle to protect the influence they have gained.
The SEC is already taking written comments and might consider rule changes next year in areas where a compromise is possible, such as raising the bar on submitting proposals.
""It is important to regularly review whether our existing rules are achieving their objectives effectively in light of changes in our marketplace,"" an SEC spokeswoman said in a statement.
Responding to social, environmental and governance concerns of investors, top fund firms, such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard Group lately have backed high-profile shareholder proposal campaigns at companies like gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co and energy giant  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM). 
Both fund firms declined to comment on the roundtable, but have previously said they vote based on clients' long-term interests. Proposals put forth by smaller firms and pension funds on areas like workforce diversity and boardroom elections have also gained ground in recent years.
Business groups were heartened when President Donald Trump appointed as SEC chair Jay Clayton, a former Wall Street lawyer who pledged to ease burdens on listed companies. The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have dramatically stepped up their lobbying on proxy issues.
""The rules governing the U.S. proxy system have failed to keep up with the times and need to be modernized for the benefit of investors, public companies, and the capital markets,"" said Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber. 
A spokesman for the manufacturers association pointed Reuters to a letter it sent to the SEC last month calling for the regulator to further tighten rules on proxy advisers.
In September, Clayton rescinded 14-year-old guidance that allowed funds to rely on recommendations from proxy advisors Glass, Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) when voting in company elections. Business lobbyists complained it gave proxy advisors too much power. 
Tougher oversight of proxy firms and raising the bar for submitting proposals will be up for debate at the Nov. 15 event.
Some investors push back.
""Some institutional investors say it's not broke, don't fix it. Why open the door to potential damage?"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents state pension funds and other asset managers. 
SEC officials have emphasized they see the roundtable as the beginning of a discussion and welcome all feedback.
""Just because something is contentious doesn’t mean we have to not deal with it,"" Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce told Reuters.
One change pitched by business groups could subject proxy advisors to stricter conflict of interest disclosure rules, according to lobbyists and SEC sources. 
Business groups say the two principal firms are potentially conflicted because ISS offers consulting services to the same companies on which it provides voting recommendations, while Glass, Lewis & Co is largely owned by activist Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. 
KT Rabin, chief executive of Glass Lewis, said the company has worked to address potential conflicts and new regulation was unnecessary, but that she was ""going to this meeting with an open mind.""
Steven Friedman, ISS general counsel, said in a statement the company welcomed the opportunity to explain its process, adding its recommendations were unbiased. 
One change sought by business groups would increase the amount of stock an investor must own to submit a proposal from the current minimum of $2,000 in most cases. 
The Council of Institutional Investors said the group would not oppose indexing that threshold to inflation. An attempt to raise it dramatically, however, would be met with resistance, other investors told Reuters.
Another idea being pushed by business groups is raising the threshold for resubmitting proposals. Currently, proposals can be resubmitted indefinitely if they get more than 10 percent of the vote, a figure lobbyists want to raise to 30 percent. 
Some investors, however, worry a higher threshold would muffle legitimate shareholder concerns and lead to other damaging rule changes. 

""As soon as the Chamber (of Commerce) has the door open one inch, they have 15 things they want to put on the table,"" said Tim Smith, senior vice-president of Walden Asset Management, a well-known filer of resolutions.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - At Suzuki Motor Corp's (T:7269) showroom in the Kenyan capital, hundreds of its Alto compact cars are waiting to be collected.
Most of the customers are drivers for ride-hailing company Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], which struck a loans and discount deal with the Japanese carmaker and South Africa's Stanbic Bank (J:SBKJ), at the beginning of the year. 
Africa should be a huge growth market for automakers. Transport links are weak and personal car ownership is low. There are 25 cars per 1000 Kenyans compared to 786 in the United States, according to the World Bank. But many in Africa cannot afford to buy a vehicle, particularly just for personal use. 
The Alto deal in Kenya, soon to be extended to Uganda and Tanzania, offers financing of up to 100 percent for top-rated Uber drivers and a price of 850,000 Kenyan shillings ($8,349.71), lower than the usual 950,000 shillings. The loans are repaid with the money the driver earns providing services. 
Patrick Amenya, the sales director at CMC Motors, the local Suzuki franchisee, said the deal had helped him sell ""more vehicles than normally we would."" Suzuki sold 523 Altos in Kenya this year.
Auto companies are linking up with fast-growing ride-hailing or delivery services around the world, aiming to transform a threat to their business into a growth opportunity. They offer discounts or financing deals for drivers in the hope they will pick their cars or vans, which could also encourage their clients to buy them. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) has invested in U.S. ride services firm Lyft and Toyota is also backing Uber. Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is also an investor in Uber and Southeast Asia's ride-sharing app Grab. 
Five blocks from CMC in Nairobi, at Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) showroom light trucks and bikes are waiting for buyers. Some of these are drivers for Sendy, a local online delivery company. Like Uber, its drivers own their vehicles.
Companies are becoming less likely to buy their own fleet of trucks, preferring a delivery service instead, said Dennis Awori, the chairman of Toyota East Africa, a Sendy investor.
Toyota provides Sendy with a pipeline of truck owners. At the moment there is no financing deal or discount but Awori and Malaika Judd, Sendy's chief operating officer, said this was under consideration. 
SECOND HAND MARKET
Suzuki's strategy has propelled it from the bottom of sales tables in Kenya, where it languished for decades with emerging brands from China, to the top five along with Toyota, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Ford.
Koichi Suzuki, Suzuki's manager for the Middle East and Africa, hopes it will soon have the edge over the others. The company is planning to adopt the same strategy in other markets.
The Altos, which are tough and fuel-efficient, at CMC are made in India but could one day be made in Africa, Suzuki said. 
Nairobi is often a springboard for the rest of Africa and Uber, operates in seven African nations and 13 cities, offering employment to more than 100,000 drivers. 
""When you have a success story in one country in Africa, we can help to develop to a pan-African scale,"" said Richard Bielle, head of Toyota's business in Africa.
Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), invested $50 million in a plant in Rwanda this year to assemble its Polo, Passat and Terramont models. It also set up a ride-hailing app called VW Mobility Solutions as no other service is available there yet. 
""Most of the people might not be able to afford a brand-new car so the question is how do we do satisfy that market?,"" said Michaella Rugwizangoga, CEO of VW Mobility Solutions.
""Our business model is to use the locally assembled VW vehicles to deliver our solutions for two years and sell them as second hand cars to the market.""
NEW CAR
Kenya's car market is dominated by second-hand imports, said Mariane Ochieng, Stanbic's head of vehicle and asset finance.
New vehicles are perceived as being out of reach of many buyers, mainly due to the higher taxes that they attract, she said.
Like millions of other young Kenyans, 25-year old Joe Wanyoike was forced into self-employment after a futile search for work when he finished secondary school in 2011.
He turned to a pre-owned vehicle imported from Japan which he hired at 50,000 shillings ($490.44) a month, and signed up on Uber to carry customers.
The company shared Wanyoike's data on number of trips, earnings and his rating of 4.7, near the maximum that is 5.0, with Stanbic Bank. This earned him a loan for a new Alto, allowing him to save money on fuel and more easily navigate Nairobi's clogged streets.
""I'm very happy because I could not afford a new car,"" he said.
After the Alto's success, CMC Motors has started discussions with Uber to increase the range of models available.

""Everybody was a bit nervous about whether it could work but now we are all seeing the possibilities,"" said Amenya.

""This is something the team is discussing,"" AirAsia X Malaysia CEO Benyamin Ismail told reporters on the sidelines of a CAPA Centre for Aviation conference.
He said the number that could be switched to A321neos had not been decided, adding the aircraft could be used in smaller markets where widebodies were too big or in off-peak seasons.
Ismail said the deal signed with Airbus in July for 34 A330neos was a memorandum of understanding that had yet to be signed off on by the company's board, but an earlier order for 66 A330neos was firm, with deliveries set to start by the end of 2019.
The airline, however, had yet to rule out the future purchase of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787s, he said, as a result of potential problems with the Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) engines on the A330neo.

Similar Rolls-Royce engines on the 787s have had significant issues requiring maintenance fixes. AirAsia X would consider buying 787s with  General Electric  (N:GE) engines, Ismail said.

79,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",How Investing in the American LNG Boom Backfired on Toshiba,"(Bloomberg) -- Buy high, sell low and guarantee a loss. It’s not exactly what Toshiba Corp. planned when it dipped its toes in liquefied natural gas trading.
Yet that’s exactly how it turned out, as the Japanese industrial giant capped off its five-year misadventure in LNG Thursday by paying ENN Ecological Holdings Co. $806 million to take its interest in a U.S. export venture off its hands. The Chinese gas distributor gets the right to liquefy and sell 2.2 million tons a year at the Freeport LNG plant in Texas, in addition to the cash.
The deal marks Toshiba’s second exit from a troubled energy business this year, after it sold claims in its Westinghouse U.S. nuclear unit in January. Toshiba said in a statement that the LNG business was no longer a core focus and it wanted to exit to eliminate the risk from changing market conditions.
“Toshiba benefits by not having to deal with a business they never really felt comfortable with,” said Nicholas Browne, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Singapore. “It’s one more item of housekeeping by Toshiba to clean house of long-term obligations and follows the writedown of the Westinghouse acquisition.”
When Toshiba struck the tolling agreement with Freeport in September 2013, the outlook for profit seemed bright. Gas sold in Asia, mostly linked to $100-a-barrel oil, was priced at a significant premium to U.S. gas made cheap by abundant supplies from shale fields.
Toshiba agreed to contracts that required it to pay for space in pipelines and the liquefaction plant regardless of whether or not it used them. Toshiba never disclosed its costs, but Wood Mackenzie estimated its fixed costs at about $360 million a year, or a $7.2 billion liability for the life of the 20-year contract.

That was fine back then when the profit margin was wide. But in 2014, global oil prices crashed, bringing down the cost of LNG contracts linked to it. For much of the past four years U.S. LNG, after adding in tolling and shipping costs, would have had to be sold at a loss in Asia.
The tolling agreement may also be hard for a tech-focused company without much experience in commodity trading like Toshiba to manage by itself. Toshiba would potentially need to source its own feed gas, figure out pipeline shipping logistics and even charter vessels for export. While the company said it recently signed binding sales agreements for LNG shipped from Freeport, it never announced the name of the buyers.
As well, falling costs for renewable power has slowed global demand for gas-powered turbines, hurting any plans Toshiba had of offering gas supply coupled with power generation equipment, according to Zhi Xin Chong, an analyst with IHS Markit in Singapore.
As a second wave of prospective U.S. exporters began offering lower costs for tolling fees, Toshiba would have been forced to grant extra incentives to make its deal look more favorable.
“Some new U.S. LNG projects are offering more competitive cost structures than were on offer during the first U.S. LNG wave, leaving some legacy U.S. LNG contracts out of the money,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
Ironically, as Toshiba completed the deal, U.S. LNG is once again competitive in Asia, thanks to a rally in oil prices. Adding liquefaction, shipping and other costs to a December 2020-delivery U.S. natural gas futures contract, the price is almost identical to the same volume of gas in a typical Brent-linked cargo.
“U.S. LNG can be competitive against LNG oil-indexed contracts,” IHS’ Chong said. But “commodity arbitrage was a secondary consideration for Toshiba.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday filed a civil fraud lawsuit accusing UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), Switzerland's largest bank, of defrauding investors in its sale of residential mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008-09 global financial crisis.
UBS was accused of misleading investors about the quality of more than $41 billion of subprime and other risky mortgage loans backing 40 securities offerings in 2006 and 2007, the Department of Justice said in a complaint filed with the federal court in Brooklyn.
The lawsuit came after UBS rejected a government proposal that it pay nearly $2 billion to settle, according to a person familiar with the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly about them.
While UBS was not a big originator of U.S. residential home loans, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn said investors suffered ""catastrophic losses"" from the bank's failure to fully disclose the risks of mortgage securities it helped sell.
A UBS spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the settlement talks, but the bank said it will fight the lawsuit.
""The DOJ's claims are not supported by the facts or the law,"" it said in a statement. ""UBS is confident in its legal position and has been fully prepared for some time to defend itself in court.""
U.S. officials are seeking unspecified fines against UBS under a federal law allowing it to pursue penalties up to the amounts the bank gained or others lost from alleged misconduct.
The case is one of the last addressing alleged misconduct in the pooling and sale by large banks of mortgage securities that were a major cause of the financial crisis.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) previously settled.
'LYING IS OK'
U.S. officials faulted UBS for having a business culture that placed a higher priority on profits than full disclosure to investors, who were deprived of crucial information about the quality of the loans underlying the securities they bought.
Thursday's lawsuit quoted a UBS trader who in a 2006 instant message said ""our crack due diligence effort is a joke,"" and a UBS mortgage employee who the same year complained to his bosses about the bank's ethics, including that ""Lying is ok.""
Like UBS, Barclays had also resisted settling prior to being sued by the Justice Department. That case ended in March with a $2 billion settlement.
UBS was among the banks hardest hit in the financial crisis, and has said it lost more than $45 billion after the U.S. housing market collapsed.
It was not immediately clear how much UBS has set aside for the U.S. case, though analysts said it might be more than half the 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) it has reserved for so-called non-core legal risks.
UBS is also fighting charges by investigators in France that it helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in that country, and turned down a 1.1 billion euro ($1.25 billion) settlement offer, judicial sources have said.
Shares of UBS closed up 1.3 percent in European trading earlier on Thursday. The U.S. lawsuit was made public after markets closed in that country.

The case is U.S. v UBS Securities LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-06369.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) results beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday thanks to summer crowds that swarmed into its theme parks and filled theaters showing Marvel movie ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."" 
The family entertainment company also revealed plans for a new ""Star Wars"" video series for its forthcoming streaming service, that it has named Disney+ and plans to launch late next year, aiming to make up for the continuing loss of subscribers from ESPN and other cable networks.
Disney is trying to transform itself into a broad-based digital entertainment company as audiences move to Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube and other digital options. It is on the verge of gaining new film and television properties in a $71.3 billion purchase of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA).
Overall revenue in the quarter rose 12 percent to $14.3 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $13.73 billion. Net income climbed 33 percent to $2.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 for beat analysts' consensus of $1.34, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pgi3EG)
Shares of Disney, which have gained nearly 8 percent this year, rose 1.7 percent in after-hours trading to $118.
Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger announced https://www.starwars.com/news/cassian-andor-live-action-series-announced that Disney's Lucasfilm is developing a second Star Wars live-action series for Disney+, a prequel to ""Rogue One"" starring Diego Luna. 
The company also is working on a live-action Marvel series for the new service about Thor's devious brother Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston.
Iger said Disney will give a first look at the Disney+ app and its programming at an investor conference in April. 
The CEO also was upbeat about the prospects for Hulu, an on-demand and live TV service. Disney will own 60 percent of the streaming service after the Fox purchase, and Iger told CNBC that Disney would be interested in buying the remaining stakes from Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) and AT&T Inc (N:T) if they were willing to sell.
Iger said he saw ""an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side,"" and he believed there was room to raise prices.For the just-ended quarter, the media networks unit, Disney's largest, reported a 4 percent year-over-year rise in operating income of $1.5 billion as broadcaster ABC saw higher program sales and fees from channel distributors. 
The ESPN cable network continued to shed subscribers, the company said, as viewing moves to digital platforms. 
To counter that ongoing shift, Disney this year released a streaming service called ESPN+ with live college sports, documentaries and other programming that does not run on television. Disney+, by comparison, will include movies and TV shows aimed at family audiences, and Hulu will reach broader with edgier programming for adults.
Disney+ could lift the company's stock if the streaming service can challenge Netflix and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at global financial platform, Investing.com. 
“Disney's big beat on expectations is great news for the company which is getting ready to take on competitors in the video-streaming business who are taking away ad dollars and consumers,"" Anwar said. 
In the just-ended quarter, the theme parks division reported operating income of $829 million, an 11 percent increase from a year earlier, as guest attendance and spending at Disney's U.S. locations rose during the busy summer months. 

Profit at Disney's movie studio more than doubled to $596 million thanks to hits such as ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" and ""Incredibles 2.""

84,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Australian pay packets squeezed as more employers take 'nuclear option',"By Jonathan Barrett and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - In Australia, it's known as the ""nuclear option"". An employer applies to the court to rip up an expiring wages deal, puts workers back on their industry's minimum pay, and then negotiates a new contract.
The once-rare negotiating tactic is becoming more widespread, used by companies including  BP  (L:BP),  Alcoa  (N:AA) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), to change work schedules and conditions, and in some cases, cut pay rates. 
A Reuters analysis of court disclosures shows there were almost 400 applications in 2017/18 to terminate expired enterprise bargaining agreements - contracts governing wages and conditions. That's nearly four times the number of applications from four years earlier.
Growth in the tactic coincides with a sustained period of record low wages growth in Australia, which is weighing on consumer spending and has become a battleground for the conservative government six months out from a general election.
Low wage growth is a global phenomenon, but Australia is an extreme example even as its A$1.8 trillion economy is in its 27th successive year of expansion.
After adjusting for inflation, Australia's 0.4 percent annual average wage rise is far behind the United States' 1.2 percent, South Korea's 1.9 percent and Germany's 0.9 percent, according to data from Statista.
One reason is the collapse in recent years of the once-in-a-century mining boom, which spelled an end to many six-digit pay packages and annual average wage hikes of 4 percent or more.
Pay rises have more than halved and unemployment has shot up as many high-flying mine workers who once made A$200,000 ($145,000) a year with access to resort-style housing were forced to turn to low-paid day laborer jobs.
Australia's wage growth stagnates even as jobless rate plunges - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RL1vSb
'NEGOTIATING WITH NOTHING'
Employer groups say some of the changes sought by companies are needed to keep workplaces flexible and competitive, and help progress talks when unions refuse to negotiate in good faith.
Jay Scoffern, an auto-electrician in Western Australia, was involved in a long-running pay dispute with Griffin Coal, run by a  Lanco Infratech  (NS:LAIN) subsidiary, now under the control of ICICI Bank-appointed receivers. 
Scoffern said pay packets were reduced by up to A$40,000 ($29,000) a year after workers were returned to industry minimums when pay negotiations stalled at the loss-making mine.
""You're negotiating with nothing, you end up trying to salvage what you can and end up taking what gets offered,"" he said.
ICICI said in a statement it was not involved in the wages negotiations. Griffin previously said there was a discrepancy in the cost of production and the income received for its coal, making changes to the agreement necessary.
The union-affiliated opposition Labor Party, leading in opinion polls, plans to stop companies from ""too easily resorting to the nuclear option"" at a time of stagnating pay packets, said Brendan O'Connor, Labor's shadow minister for employment and workplace relations.
""If elected, a ... Labor government will change the law in order to redress the imbalance in bargaining power between workers, their unions, and employers,"" O'Connor in a statement.
Australia's Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, Kelly O’Dwyer, said unions wanted agreements to remain in place in perpetuity and there were ""significant safeguards"" for workers in the process overseen by Australia's industrial relations tribunal. 
""Before an agreement can be terminated, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that it is not contrary to the public interest to do so, and that the termination is appropriate,"" O'Dwyer said in a statement.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said any shift to give unions more power to negotiate industry-wide rates would push workplace relations back into the ""dark ages"". 
""A sector-wide bargaining system would only empower the big unions at the expense of workers,"" Westacott said in a statement. 
Australia's GDP accelerates but wages lag - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QlkvX2
WAGES PRESSURE
Australia's largest freight operator, Aurizon Operations, adopted the approach in 2015 when it got a series of expired agreements annulled during a stalemate in negotiations. 
Many resources and energy companies, including Peabody Energy (N:BTU), and the local arms of BP and ExxonMobil (N:XOM) followed Aurizon's lead, in part to wind back what they said were unsustainable wages and conditions lingering from the mining boom years.
BP Australia applied last month to terminate an agreement at a refinery in Western Australia after extended negotiations. 
""BP applied to terminate the expired agreement because it includes a number of terms that restrict productivity, efficiency and flexibility, and does not meet business needs,"" BP said in a statement to Reuters, adding it did not want to reduce salaries. 
Late last year and after prolonged negotiations, consumer products giant Unilever sought the termination of an agreement at its Australian factory, which a spokeswoman said lacked the flexibility needed to run a competitive seasonal business.
“We could not continue operating without changes as it was simply not sustainable,” she said. A new agreement was then struck.
Some agreements have also been terminated with the consent of workers at the end of projects. 
But unions say the strategy is too often used to unfairly pressure workers.

""It has become too easy for unscrupulous employers to bully people with the prospect of cutting their wages by using the threat of agreement terminations to push them back to the legal minimum for their industry,"" Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus said in a statement.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",Coke's coffers crammed with kina as dollar crunch hits Papua New Guinea,"By Tom Westbrook
(Reuters) - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has mastered the business of getting its sweet, fizzy drinks into even the most isolated of Papua New Guinea's far-flung tropical islands and mountain villages. 
But getting the proceeds out of the South Pacific nation is proving much more troublesome, undermining efforts by the host of this month's APEC meeting to portray itself as an attractive destination for international investment. 
Australian-listed Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coke in the region, recently disclosed it was holding more of PNG's kina currency than it wanted due to foreign exchange restraints, a complaint echoed by other big businesses.
The restrictions, used to prop up the kina by fixing its value in a narrow band, have created a shortage of dollars and a weeks-long queue to buy them. That is stifling business investment and with it, the country's economic prospects, business leaders say.
""For most customers, it has provided an impediment to the growth of their business,"" said Robin Fleming, Chief Executive of Bank South Pacific, PNG's biggest commercial bank and largest foreign exchange dealer.
""It's really strained some of those relationships with their suppliers overseas,"" he said on the phone from his office in the dusty seaside capital, Port Moresby.
DIGGING IN
Port Moresby is the venue for this month's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of world leaders and PNG is hoping to use the high-profile event to showcase the nation and its investment credentials.
PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said earlier this year that after APEC, ""everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is"" and not confuse it with an African country. 
Papua New Guinea has one of the largest economies in the Pacific Islands region, backed by mining, timber, fishing and huge energy reserves.
Riding booming commodity prices, the kina touched as high as $0.47 in 2013 but fell as low as $0.33 the following year when the oil price plunged. 
Demand for kina also dropped away sharply since the end of construction in 2014 of a giant LNG project led by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
The dollar shortfall was exacerbated by lower-than-expected tax receipts from the PNG LNG project and disruptions to copper and gold exports.
Papua New Guinea's central bank responded by fixing the currency to a 150 basis point band either side of about $0.41 in June 2014. That made dollars cheaper overnight, driving a spike in demand exceeding meager supplies held locally by exporters.
Demand for foreign currency exceeded supply by about $500 million in August, according to Papua New Guinea's central bank's most recent policy update.
That has left businesses - even those earmarked for priority access to foreign currency such as food, fuel, aviation and medicine - pleading with suppliers to accept late payments.
""It does make it a challenge to get the currency you need to import materials,"" such as sugar, aluminum tins and plastic bottles, Coca-Cola Amatil's Sydney-based spokesman Patrick Low said.
Meanwhile, CCA's stockpile of cash in kina jumped by more than a third over the 12 months to June 30 to 687 million kina ($200 million), half-year accounts show.
Other businesses find themselves similarly hamstrung.
""We need to minimize our purchasing in Australia,"" said Ariel Sarangya, who manages a computer shop in the highlands and has cut back buying stock due to a lack of foreign currency.
""You need to wait up to three months, sometimes more than that, it's up to the banks. We have to take whatever they give.""
Heineken subsidiary South Pacific Brewery Ltd has quit all non-essential capital expenditure since the crunch began and has struggled to remit dividends to its parent, managing director, Stan Joyce, told Reuters.
The company even briefly considered buying coffee and trying to sell that offshore to bring in some U.S. dollars, he added. 
DIGGING OUT
Economists say the solution is to let the kina gradually fall to encourage dollars to flow.
But the government is staking its hopes on an anticipated $13 billion in foreign investment expected as part of an expansion of the PNG LNG project, and recovering commodity prices, to stabilize the currency.
It has also cut dollar-denominated imports of fuel and last month raised $500 million with its debut sovereign bond issue.
""Much work going into import replacement, bringing fishing and logging industries processing onshore, lowering transport, energy and communication costs,"" Treasurer Charles Abel said in an email, adding the backlog should be cleared by year's end.
Businesses and economists are less sure, and say restraints need to be dropped before investment flows again.
In the meantime, though, Coke is flowing just fine, with PNG revenue and earnings up for the half-year.

""The most popular drink here in Papua New Guinea is Coke,"" said Raymond Yafus, a storeman at a supermarket in PNG's second-largest city, Lae.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Almost three-quarters of Japanese firms said the recent data falsification scandal involving KYB Corp, a maker of earthquake shock absorbers, has hurt Japan's corporate image, a Reuters poll found, although few saw any impact on their businesses.
KYB last month admitted it had falsified data on the quality of some of its quake ""dampers"" since at least 2003, one of the latest compliance scandals that has shaken confidence in Japan's manufacturing prowess.
Earlier this month, Hitachi Chemical Co said it found improper tests were conducted on nearly 30 more products, after Kobe Steel Ltd and Toray Industries Inc admitted data falsification or other types of misconduct.
These cases have ""badly damaged the value of 'Made in Japan,'"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the Reuters Corporate Survey, which found 71 percent of companies believed the KYB scandal would tarnish Japan's reputation.
""Companies have lost their pride during the 'Lost Two Decades,'"" another machinery maker manager said, referring to the economic slump Japan endured after the collapse of the 1980s Bubble Economy.
However, when asked if the KYB scandal would affect their own business, 94 percent said it wouldn't. 
Just 5 percent said they planned to take steps in reaction to the scandal, while 16 percent said they would wait and see. The rest said they didn't plan to take any steps.

Companies responded anonymously to the survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research. It polled 482 large and mid-sized non-financial firms, about 240 of which responded to the questions on KYB's scandals during the Oct. 24-Nov. 5 period.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:58PM ET</span>",Tesla names director Denholm to replace Musk as board chair,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Michelle Price
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has named director Robyn Denholm as board chair, fulfilling a demand by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to strip the job from Elon Musk, the electric car maker's wayward chief executive who has dragged the company through months of turbulence.
The appointment was required as part of a September deal Tesla struck with the securities regulator to settle fraud charges against Musk and Tesla. Legal experts said it was unclear if Denholm, who has been on Tesla's board for four years, was independent enough for Tesla to comply with the court-approved settlement.
Denholm, 55, joined Tesla as an independent director in 2014 and is the head of its audit committee. She was paid almost $5 million, mainly in stock options, by the company last year, making her the highest remunerated of its board members.
She is finance chief at Australian telecoms firm Telstra Corp Ltd and previously worked for Toyota in Australia, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. She will resign from Telstra to take the Tesla role full-time.
Whether she is independent enough to rein in public outbursts by Musk - who mocked the SEC as the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter after the fraud charge settlement - is an open question. 
Denholm sat on the board when Musk set production targets for the Model 3 car that were not met, and also when the chief executive tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, which prompted the SEC to file fraud charges against him. 
The court-approved settlement of those charges requires Tesla to certify in writing that it has appointed an ""independent"" chairman and to provide evidence and exhibits to make its case. 
While the definition of ""independent"" is typically broad, legal experts suggested the court could ultimately conclude Tesla was not in compliance with the letter of the settlement.
""It does violate the spirit of the settlement, which was to change the culture of the board so there was a check on Musk's worst instincts,"" said Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate governance at Santa Clara University.
The SEC declined to comment beyond the court judgment.
Musk, who remains Tesla's biggest shareholder and the driving force behind its ambitious plans to reshape electric battery technology and car transport, tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1060452014642016256 his approval of the appointment. 
""Musk, I believe, has a ton to do with the selection and he wants to be sure that they can see eye-to-eye,"" said Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel.
Top proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co had each classified Denholm as an ""independent"" director of Tesla in reports to the carmaker's investors earlier this year.
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Denholm pumped petrol at her parents' filling station before going on to study at Sydney University and joining accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
Since then, she has worked at Swiss power grid maker ABB Ltd, network gear firm Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) and computing firm Sun Microsystems. She has also been national manager of finance for Toyota Australia. 
Telstra CEO Andy Penn said when he appointed her: ""Robyn has a proven track record as a global COO in a business focused on telecommunications networks.""
Executive recruiter Patricia Lenkov, however, said that Denholm likely was not the right pick for the job, arguing Tesla needed a figure with more experience dealing with strong founders. 
""There might be an element of risk here. She's not a proven entity in this kind of work,"" she said. 
While Tesla is finally starting to make good on Musk's promises on production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to the company's future, it has lost senior executives for sales, human resources, manufacturing and finance in recent months. 
Its vice president for manufacturing Gilbert Passin was reported last month to have left.
""We view the fact that Denholm has prior industry experience with Toyota positively,"" said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson, adding it made sense that Tesla should seek to avoid the risk of a genuine outsider clashing with Musk. 
The Silicon Valley billionaire's gift for self-promotion has made Tesla one of the world's most talked-about businesses but also caused public spats with journalists, analysts, Wall Street investors and even rapper Azealia Banks.
He is being sued for calling one of the divers behind this year's Thai cave rescue a ""pedo"".
According to The Australian newspaper, Denholm said the only things that really disappoint her are rudeness and waste. 
""Politeness costs you absolutely nothing. It doesn't matter whether you are the most senior person in the room, or the most junior,"" she told the paper in an interview a few years ago. 

Tesla shares closed up about 1 percent at $351.40.

88,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:42PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. With the Fed, It’s the Little Things
If the Federal Reserve’s statement were homework, the teacher would hand it back, saying it’s almost exactly what you submitted last time.
There were, indeed, very few changes to the FOMC statement as it kept rates steady. That was reflected in the reaction of stocks, where the S&P sold off right at the release and bounced back just as fast to where it was before the decision.
But investors aren’t grading the Fed on originality. And even the smallest changes will be parsed.
In this case the chatter looks concentrated on the Fed’s new assessment of business fixed investment.
The “growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,” the Fed said in today’s statement.
That contrasted with “business fixed investment (has) grown strongly” in the September statement.
The change indicates that the Fed sees some moderating of the economy, but is content with its slow and steady rate hike pace. That’s sounds a little bearish for stocks, but the market will decide.



2. PPI, Michigan Sentiment on Tap
The market won’t get too long to dwell on Fed language before there are more numbers to digest.
The Labor Department releases its latest measure on wholesale inflation at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economist predict that the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.2% in October, the same as the month before.
Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% last month, also the same as September's reading.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of November consumer sentiment.
On average, economists expect the index to drop down slightly to 98.
3.  Disney  Tops Earnings Expectations
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) could help the Dow tomorrow morning after handily beating Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines.
The company said after the bell it earned $1.48 a share on revenue of $14.31 billion.
Share rose nearly 2% in after-hours trading.
Highlighting the sparser earnings calendar tomorrow morning will be numbers from defense company Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL)."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower on Thursday after a Federal Reserve statement, and energy stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as U.S. crude oil prices fell.
The U.S. central bank said after its two-day meeting that strong job gains and household spending were keeping the economy on track but business investment ""moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,"" creating a possible drag on future economic growth.
Aside from the comment about business investments, the Fed statement was largely as expected and suggested to investors that the Fed's next rate hike would be in December. But some investors had hoped for a change in tone after October's market sell-off.
""The Fed has recognized that there is one part of the economy that is slowing a little bit, but it is not deterring them from their 'gradual increase' language. Not yet anyway,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, Richmond, Virginia.
""There is really nothing to point to what the market had hoped, that there would be a more dovish stance. So I think this is more of what we call a hawkish hold.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 10.92 points, or 0.04 percent, to 26,191.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 7.06 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,806.83 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 39.87 points, or 0.53 percent, to 7,530.89.
The three indexes had all risen 2 percent in the previous day's session due to a relief rally once the U.S. midterm congressional elections were in the rearview mirror.
Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey said companies were holding off on spending because of uncertainty over a U.S.-China trade war. 
""A slowdown in business spending can slow the underpinning of the stock market,” Krosby said. ""Is the Fed data-dependent or is it maintaining a rigid schedule for rate hikes in 2019? What would cause the Fed to pause? It’s clear from this statement today that they’re looking at anything that could potentially slow the economy."" 
The S&P bank index <.SPXBK> ended the day with a 0.4 percent gain as U.S. Treasury yields rose because bank profits benefit from rising rates.
Energy stocks were the S&P's biggest drag with a 2.2 percent drop as U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) confirmed a bear market, falling more than 20 percent from their Oct. 3 high as investors focused on swelling global crude supply, which is increasing more quickly than many had expected. [O/R]

The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.04% gain, but the S&P 500 fell 0.25%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.53%.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold Thursday, but delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy and labor market, propping up the odds of a December rate hike, renewing concerns about the threat less risky U.S. government bonds pose to stocks.
The U.S. 10-year yields ticked higher to remain within touching distance of fresh 11-year highs. Rising Treasury yields tend to boost investor demand for bonds over stocks.
""We expect the current pattern of a hike a quarter to continue through Q1 of next year, before a slowdown in growth and still only moderate inflation allows the Fed to ease up on the pace of rate hikes later in 2019,"" CIBC said in a note following the Fed statement.
Ahead of the Fed's statement, sentiment on equities was rocked by weakness in energy stocks as U.S. oil prices extended losses to  enter bear-market territory -- defined as a 20% decline from a recent peak.

The letter, sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Finance Bill Morneau on Wednesday, asks that 100,000 tonnes of rebar, steel bar used to reinforce concrete, be exempt from new steel quotas and tariffs announced last month, and that any steel in transit before the new measures also be excluded.
""British Columbia's construction industry is caught in a precarious position as a result of your government's provisional safeguard measures,"" the letter said. 
It was signed by the presidents of the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association of BC, the Vancouver Regional Construction Association, and the Urban Development Institute, which represents major developers.
On Oct. 25, Canada imposed new steel import controls called safeguards on seven types of steel, capping imports from most countries based on historical shipments, and setting a 25 percent tariff on any imports above those caps.
The measures were meant to reassure U.S. officials that cheap metal would not leak across the border if U.S. tariffs were lifted, and ensure that steel shut out of the U.S. market did not harm Canadian steel mills owned by  Stelco  Holdings (TO:STLC), ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AS:MT) and others.
""Our government is listening to the concerns of some in the sector and is assessing ways to minimize the impact of safeguards in certain specific import situations, while maintaining the broad objectives of the provisional safeguards,"" Department of Finance spokesman Pierre-Olivier Herbert said in an emailed statement.
Safeguards are intended to stabilize markets during unusual import surges, not raise prices. But their impact may vary across the country, as most Canadian steel is produced in Ontario. 
British Columbia, which does not produce steel and is separated from the rest of the country by the Rocky Mountains, relies heavily on rebar shipped from the northwest United States and overseas.
Residential land prices have soared in British Columbia in recent years, raising the cost of housing. Tariffs may raise costs even more, at a time when sales are plunging and consumers are struggling with higher mortgage rates.

""Shipping across the country from the east is cost prohibitive, and importing from the U.S. and from overseas has now become more expensive,"" said Fiona Famulak, president of the Vancouver Regional Construction Association. ""We have a lot at stake.""

96,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Brazil risks Middle East trade with Israel embassy move,"By Ana Mano and Jake Spring
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - A proposal by Brazil's next president to relocate its embassy in Israel, following U.S. President Donald Trump's lead, may set off a diplomatic storm in the Muslim world, threatening a key market for the world's largest meat companies.
Brazil is by far the world's largest exporter of halal meat, which complies with Muslim dietary rules. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's plans to move Brazil's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, strengthening relations with Israel, has already upset Egypt and could soon stir trouble with other Islamic nations.
""The reaction will be given not only as an individual country but on behalf of the whole Muslim world,"" a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""We are expecting Brazil to act with reason and not confront the Muslim world."" 
Brazil exports $16 billion annually to the Middle East and Turkey, with just 3 percent going to Israel, according to government statistics. 
More than a quarter of Brazil's exports to the region are meat. Both Brazil's JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), the world's top beef producer, and BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), the No. 1 poultry exporter, have bet big on the growing demand for halal meat.
Brazil exports over $5 billion of halal meat per year, more than twice its nearest rivals, Australia and India, according to Salaam Gateway, a partnership between the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre and Thomson Reuters.
Bolsonaro's proposal for the Israel embassy is part of his overhaul of Brazilian foreign policy, cozying up to major powers such as the United States and undoing what he calls leftist predecessors' alliances based on ""ideological bias.""
Trump's decision to open an embassy in Jerusalem in May stirred a hornets' nest in the Middle East, and the United States had few allies follow suit. Guatemala did so in the days afterward while Paraguay has since reversed a similar decision.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Bolsonaro for the plan to move Brazil's embassy, calling him a ""friend.""
But after Egypt abruptly canceled a visit from Brazilian diplomats and business leaders this week, Bolsonaro said his decision on the embassy in Israel was not final.
Bolsonaro has shown already he is not afraid to give an important trade partner a poke in the eye, following the example of the U.S. president, whom he openly admires and emulates in both political style and foreign policy. 
Like Trump, Bolsonaro railed against China on the campaign trail. He has softened his stance since the election last month, however, amid lobbying from diplomats and executives keen to protect relations with Brazil's largest trading partner.
CANCELED TRIP
The pressure from the Middle East may be more blunt.
Egypt on Monday called off the visit by Brazil's top diplomat and executives just days before they were set to arrive, which two diplomatic sources said was a direct response to Bolsonaro's proposal to move the embassy. 
The Egyptian embassy blamed a scheduling conflict.
That has sounded alarm bells in Brazil's meat industry.
BRF Chairman Pedro Parente said on Thursday earnings call that the Israel embassy issue was ""cause for concern.""
""We have a very important trade with Arab and halal markets,"" he told journalists. ""We are confident that when a discussion of the matter involves the relevant areas — the farm, trade and foreign ministries — they will certainly reach the best solution.""
BRF's halal business segment contributed a quarter of its operating revenue and nearly half of its operating profit in the third quarter.
Halal chicken represented nearly half of Brazil's overall chicken exports of $7.1 billion last year, according to Brazil meatpacking group ABPA.
""There is a $2-billion trade between Egypt and Brazil, mainly in the food agricultural sector, and within that sector mainly in beef and poultry,"" Egypt's Ambassador to Brazil Alaa Roushdy told Reuters.
He declined to comment on a hypothetical move of the embassy or if it could have any impact on trade.
BRF has processing plants in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to meet growing demand for halal meat. The company aims to double its output of processed products in the Gulf by 2023, its head of halal operations said at an October event.
JBS sent more than an eighth of its exports to the Middle East and Africa in 2017, second only to the Greater China region. 
Representatives for JBS declined to comment on fallout from a potential embassy move.
The Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce expects Brazil's total exports to a grouping of 22 Arab countries, which excludes non-Arab Muslim nations such as Iran, to swell to $20 billion by 2022, up from $13.5 billion in 2017.
Rubens Hannun, the chamber's president, added that Brazil also stands to benefit from infrastructure investment from Arab sovereign funds. UAE's Mubadala Development Co, for example, poured some $2 billion into Brazilian commodities empire EBX earlier this decade.
""We do not want any noise in this relationship,"" Hannun said. ""We are afraid that would open a door for the competition.""

(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) is planning to launch a range of energy drinks for the first time on its own brand name as it intensifies efforts to break away from its traditional fizzy sodas and shift to health-focused trends.
The company on Thursday told Reuters it was working on plans to launch new drinks which would be branded ""Coca-Cola Energy"" and ""Coca-Cola Energy No Sugar"" and made with naturally-derived caffeine and guarana extract.
Coke has previously taken a cautious approach to energy drinks as they are wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets after some drinks were linked to deaths in young people.
The company initially took a nearly 17 percent stake in energy drinks maker  Monster Beverage  Corp (O:MNST) in 2015, making Coke the largest shareholder, to sample at a distance the market in which it had a small presence with its NOS and Full throttle brands.
However, the partnership has turned rocky with Coke currently in arbitration with Monster Beverage over the launch of the Coke energy drinks, as it would put it in direct competition with Monster and violate their initial 2015 agreement.
""We have submitted the difference in interpretation to an arbitration panel for resolution, which is the mechanism agreed by the Coca-Cola Co and Monster in the original agreements,"" a Coca-Cola spokesperson said.
Analysts, however, were skeptical whether consumers would take to Coke's energy drinks under a brand mainly associated with fizzy sodas.
""While Coca-Cola certainly has the distribution muscle to push new offerings, we question the fit of an energy drink under the Coca-Cola trademark,"" Cowen & Co analyst Vivien Azer said.
Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said he did not think Coke's new line of beverages would gain meaningful market share as consumers of energy drinks opt for something edgier.
Astrachan said Coca-Cola may be using the launch to enhance the consumption of trademark Coke drinks rather than materially change its relationship with Monster that is currently worth about $6 billion.

Monster shares fell 10 percent on Thursday after it revealed that it was in arbitration with Coke, while Coca-Cola shares were down marginally at $49.27.

DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) fell the most in more than three years, before paring some losses, after posting fiscal-fourth revenue that fell short of estimates, while earnings were roughly in line.
In a further sign that the sun continues to set on the U.S. housing market, D.R. Horton warned of slowing order growth, adding that the market for homes is getting “choppy.” Its shares fell more than 5%.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) fell 1%, but was off the lows of the day, as it looked to avoid a third-straight day in the red. The homebuilder's shares had been on a downward spiral since October following its cut to full-year guidance, but found its footing, albeit briefly, following an ratings upgrade from Wedbush a little over a week ago.
Wedbush upgraded its rating on Lennar to outperform from neutral on expectations that the homebuilder would rid its income statement of a ""lingering distraction"" by selling Rialto to Stone Point Capital.
Lennar agreed to sell Rialto Management Business to investment funds managed by Stone Point Capital for $340 million in late October.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) also added to the weakness in the broader homebuilders sector, slipping 1%, but remained well off session lows.
U.S. homebuilders are expected to remain in focus as market participants await a Federal Reserve rate decision due late Thursday for further clues that a December rate hike remains on the table.
Rising interest rates have wreaked havoc on the housing sector, boosting mortgage rates above the 5% threshold in October for the first time since early 2011, reining in home-buying activity."

114,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",French prosecutors call for 3.7 billion euro fine against UBS,"PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors argued in a Paris court on Thursday for Swiss bank UBS AG (S:UBSG) to be fined 3.7 billion euros for helping wealthy French people evade taxes.
After a seven-year investigation and aborted settlement negotiations, UBS faces accusations of laundering the proceeds of tax fraud and illegally soliciting clients in France.
""Tax evasion is nothing more than theft against the community,"" prosecutor Eric Russo told the court. 
Serge Roque, the trial's other prosecutor, added: ""UBS has deliberately held, handled and managed accounts for people who were evading taxes.""
Under French law, those convicted of money laundering can be ordered to pay a fine worth half the amount laundered. The prosecution estimates UBS's customers hidden several billion euros from the French tax authorities.
On Wednesday, the lawyer representing the French government asked to be awarded 1.6 billion euros in damages.
UBS has denied wrongdoing.

The prosecution also called for suspended jail sentences ranging from six months to 24 months for six UBS executives and former executives, as well as fines ranging from 50,000 euros to 500,000 euros.

Facebook fell about 2.4% at 12:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
EU Competition Chief Margrethe Vestager is considering whether to probe the social networking company’s European tax arrangements, Politico reported, citing two people close to the case.
Vestager has already seized documents relating to Facebook’s Irish tax deals, a former Irish civil servant told Politico.
It’s not surprising the stock is taking a breather as investors took some profits following yesterday’s rally and waited for the Fed decision this afternoon.
But a surprising move came in videogame stocks, where Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) fell about 4.0% despite posting a strong profit and boosting guidance.
“As a result of our strong second quarter performance and outstanding early results from Red Dead Redemption 2, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2019, which is also poised to be a record year for Net Bookings and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow,” the company said in its earnings release.
One reason for the selloff may be that despite the strong earnings, sales were well short of expectations.
Another could be the company being a victim of its own success, as there were concerns the “Red Dead Redemption” franchise could draw gamer attention and dollars away from the “Grand Theft Auto” franchise.
“We do not see any cannibalization, nor do I expect any,” Take-Two Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said on the earnings call, The Wall Street Journal reported."

124,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","U.S. Senate hearing over Hyundai, Kia engine fires on hold","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said on Thursday that a hearing planned for Nov. 14 on reports of engine fires involving  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) vehicles was on hold, but could be rescheduled for a future date.
Last month, the committee invited the U.S. chief executives of the two Korean automakers after safety advocates raised concerns about fires in vehicles not involved in collisions.
The non-profit consumer advocacy group Center for Auto Safety said last month 103 fire complaints had been filed with U.S. safety regulators since June 12 and urged an immediate recall of nearly 3 million vehicles.
""While the committee does not anticipate convening a hearing on vehicle fire safety next week as previously contemplated, discussions among the committee and two auto manufacturers about participation at a future date remain ongoing,"" Frederick Hill, a spokesman for Senator John Thune who chairs the Commerce Committee, said on Thursday.
Hyundai and its affiliate Kia — together the world's No. 5 auto group — both said they had cooperated with Senate Committee staff on the issue and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in its ongoing investigation.
Kia said in a statement that ""to quickly and effectively address non-collision fire incidents, (the company) is using in-house and third-party fire-investigation companies and has engaged an independent senior fire expert to evaluate the results of such fire event investigations.""
The company has consulted with Frank Borris, who until 2016 headed the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation ""to evaluate the organization's response to these incidents,"" Kia said.
It would ""take any necessary corrective action in a timely manner,"" Kia added.
Hyundai said separately it ""unequivocally (shares) the committee's goal of assuring the safety of (its) vehicles. Hyundai welcomes a more comprehensive review of non-collision fires among all automakers.""
In May 2017, the NHTSA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation, opened a formal investigation into the recall of nearly 1.7 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine defects.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to the NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three recalls carried out in the United States and whether they covered enough vehicles.
Hyundai said it has fixed an above-average of number of recalled vehicles to date.
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash.
At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same ""Theta II"" engines.
In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with ""Theta II"" engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris, the NHTSA said.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","Volkswagen, Daimler agree to pay for diesel fixes","By Matthias Inverardi and Michelle Martin
COLOGNE, Germany/BERLIN (Reuters) - German carmakers agreed to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,430) per vehicle to help reduce diesel emissions as the government and industry respond to driving bans in major cities.
While Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer and car bosses were hammering out a deal on anti-pollution measures in a five-hour meeting on Thursday, a court ruled that two more German cities, Cologne and Bonn, must impose bans on older diesel vehicles.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are prepared to offer hardware retrofits to clean up older diesel vehicles at their own cost, Scheuer said following the meeting, adding that rival BMW (DE:BMWG) was still refusing to do so.
But all three big German carmakers, including VW, were committed to spending up to 3,000 euros for various measures, including trade-in incentives.
Scheuer said they were all keen to press ahead with such incentives, which aim to convince customers to buy newer, cleaner vehicles that have lower emissions and would not be affected by driving bans.
The government has been pushing carmakers to shoulder more of the burden of retrofitting cars, though Germany's auto giants have been reluctant to take on more costs than necessary.
""Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW will make sure their customers can remain mobile,"" Scheuer told reporters, urging foreign rivals, like Fiat and Peugeot to match the efforts he said the German firms had made.
Scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars has dealt repeated blows to the global reputation of Germany's car industry in recent years.
As the industry leaders were meeting Scheuer, a court in Cologne ordered driving bans in some parts of the city from next April, underlining the stakes for politicians concerned that a lack of progress could trigger deeply unpopular driving bans.
Environmental lobby group DUH had filed complaints against the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to Cologne and Bonn, saying the cities needed to ensure their nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels stuck to permitted limits and calling for a ban of diesel vehicles in those cities.
""It will cause disruption for the transport infrastructure of the city of Cologne and have a significant impact on residents, commuters and the whole of Cologne,"" said State Environment Minister Ursula Heinen-Esser.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 11:15AM ET</span>",A changing New York neighborhood wonders how Amazon would fit,"By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It was the lunch-hour rush at the Court Square (NYSE:SQ) Diner in New York's Long Island City on Wednesday, and co-owner Nick Kanellos pointed to the elevated subway tracks that rattle overhead as he fretted over the news that Amazon may build a major outpost in the neighborhood.
Like many long-time inhabitants, he worries how this once-sleepy enclave in Queens would absorb the up to 25,000 people the online retail giant may employ here as it expands outside its Seattle home base.
""It's a whole soccer stadium at 8 a.m. each day coming in,"" Kanellos said, gesturing at the narrow metal staircases leading from the subway platform to the street, already crowded with commuters at rush hour.
Amazon announced in September last year that it was seeking a site for a second corporate headquarters that would eventually employ up to 50,000 people. But it now plans to split its new headquarters between two sites, including Long Island City, according to a New York Times report.
Amazon again declined on Wednesday to comment on its selection process.
Kanellos' apprehension was shared by other long-time residents interviewed on Wednesday on their home turf, a rapidly gentrifying area that sits just across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.
Few, if any, objected to Amazon.com (O:AMZN) itself: Many conceded they were happy customers of the world's largest online retailer, some paying for its Prime membership service. They just fear that their neighborhood is already bursting at the seams, with scores of glass apartment towers transforming an area long characterized by a mismatched jumble of low-rise buildings. 
The cost of this rapid development, residents say, is that local hardware stores and pharmacies have been priced out and an aging sewer system is often overwhelmed by the more than 10,000 new apartments and 1.5 million square feet of office space built in recent years, according to city data.
Kanellos, 50, took over the Court Square Diner in 1991, when it was one of the few places where the artists then using old factory buildings as studios could sit down for a cheap meal. 
The neighborhood's cinematic views of Manhattan only heightened the sense it was a quiet village overlooked by the rest of New York City, residents say. 
""We felt like we had the place to ourselves,"" said Pat Irwin, a musician and composer who for years played with The B-52's and settled in Long Island City in the mid-1980s.
The 50-story, blue-glass tower that  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) built in 1990 was an early harbinger of the transformation. The reports this week that Amazon had decided to build part of its ""second"" headquarters here, along with an outpost in northern Virginia's Crystal City, feels to some residents like the death knell for a neighborhood they love.
""It feels like we're being walled in and it's out of control and the neighborhood can't handle it,"" Irwin said.
Irwin's wife, Terri Gloyd, is the co-owner of the LIC Corner Cafe, which sits around the corner from MoMA PS1, a major outer-borough arts museum, and sells coffee, cookies and a pastry confection described as ""a guava goat cheese Pop-Tart.""
Some of the residents who moved into the new apartment towers have become welcome regulars, even while some artist friends have been priced out of the area, she said. But construction and the ubiquitous film and television shoots, thanks to the proximity of Silvercup Studios, sometimes make the streets barely navigable to pedestrians.
""It already feels so oversaturated,"" said Gloyd, who moved here in 1987. 
Even so, if Amazon's arrival brought with it a decent supermarket or helped bring a much-needed school to an underserved area, then perhaps that could soften its landing, she said.
If there is one constant in the crane-filled neighborhood these days, it is Manducatis, a white-tablecloth, Italian restaurant that Vincenzo Cerbone, 88, has presided over since 1974, after moving to the area in the 1950s. His wife, Ida, still cooks there most days, walking from their home around the corner.
""My husband, in the '50s, he predicted this,"" she said with a proud smile, explaining their decision to acquire property in an area so close to Manhattan, no matter how unprepossessing it seemed at the time.

As for Cerbone, he shrugged at the Amazon news: New York City has always been changing. ""These days, everything is new,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's an upgrade or a downgrade.""

133,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 10:35AM ET</span>","D.R. Horton forecasts weak home sales, shares fall 10 percent","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - D.R. Horton (N:DHI) shares fell more than 10 percent after the largest U.S. homebuilder forecast first-quarter home sales below analysts' estimates on Thursday, the latest sign that rising mortgage rates and higher home prices are weighing on the housing market.
The weakness in shares also hit other homebuilders' stocks. PulteGroup (N:PHM) fell 6 percent, while  Lennar  (N:LEN) was down 4 percent.
The housing market has been a weak spot in a robust U.S. economy, with economists blaming the sluggishness on rising mortgage rates, which have combined with higher house prices, to make home purchasing unaffordable for some buyers.
""The buyer is probably affordably stretched and taking a little bit of time to reset to changing market environment,"" D.R. Horton Chief Operating Officer Michael Murray said on a conference call with analysts.
The company said it was seeing a rise in incentive spending for homes priced $300,000 and above. These kinds of homes make up about a third of the company's total deliveries.
The homebuilder said it expects incentives to increase in the face of the choppy demand environment and forecast full-year 2019 home sales gross margins to be in the range of 20 percent to 22 percent, with the midpoint below analysts' estimate of 21.48 percent.
Demand is holding up in the less expensive category, but homebuilders have not been able to boost supplies as they have been held back by scarce labor, limited lot supplies and rising raw material costs. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years.
D.R. Horton said on Thursday it expects first-quarter home deliveries in the range of 11,000-11,500 units, below analysts' average estimate of 11,852 homes, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company, however, did not provide any details of its sales and profit expectations for 2019.
For the fourth quarter, the company's revenue rose 8.3 percent to $4.51 billion, but fell just short of estimate of $4.57 billion.
The company's net income rose 48.8 percent to $466.1 million, or $1.22 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, in line with analysts' expectation.

The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), down 22.3 percent this year, fell another 3 percent.

Manager magazin had reported that German carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen were prepared to fully cover the costs of the retrofits, which would reduce emissions to within permitted limits.
The VW spokesman said the report was false, adding that Volkswagen had not made such an offer. Manager magazin later updated its report to say that VW was sticking with its position that it was willing to cover 80 percent of the costs.
Car executives are meeting with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Thursday to discuss how to tackle diesel emissions in Germany. Scheuer is due to make a statement on the outcome of the talks.
Daimler declined to comment on the manager magazin report. BMW said it would comment after talks with Scheuer had concluded. The group has so far said it is not prepared to take part in a diesel hardware retrofit scheme.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government last month presented plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles and fend off diesel driving bans in cities by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",German shipyard suspends production after Saudi export ban,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German shipbuilder Luerssen has suspended production of coastguard vessels it was building for Saudi Arabia and placed large numbers of staff on short hours, blaming uncertainty over whether Berlin would grant future weapons export licenses.
After dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would authorize no further weapons exports until Riyadh had satisfactorily explained his death.
Privately-owned Luerssen was commissioned to build the coastal patrol vessels five years ago, and construction began at its Peene Shipyard in 2016.
""Suspending construction and cutting working hours as a direct consequence is a heavy blow to us,"" said shipyard official Harald Jaekel in a statement. Almost all of Peene's 300 workers would be affected, the statement said.
The uncertainty over future authorizations made production planning impossible, the company added, saying that suspending production was the only way to minimize the resulting risk.
Saudi Arabia makes a major contribution to Germany's defense industry. So far this year, some 400 million euros of exports were approved to the country, making it the second-biggest recipient of German arms after Algeria.

Riyadh at first denied that Khashoggi was dead, before finally conceding under heavy international pressure that he had in fact been killed by Saudi agents.

MONTREAL/ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - Chinese companies and individuals are selling more used private planes than in previous years as economic growth slows in China, and U.S. buyers are snapping up hard-to-find models, according to interviews with business jet analysts, dealers and consultants.
""Luxuries like private jets are often the first things to be parted with as the companies can no longer afford or justify them,"" said James Coak, vice president of international business development for Titan Aviation.
So far this year, 15 of 268 business jets operating, based or registered in China have been sold outside of the country, compared with an annual average of 10 from 2014 to 2017, according to FlightAscend Consultancy data. 
Total used sales from China are expected to reach about 20 this year, FlightAscend senior valuations analyst Daniel Hall said.
Half of this year's sales so far have landed in the United States, Hall said, where a sluggish business jet market in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis is turning around partly due to more favorable U.S. tax laws for corporate aircraft ownership.
The uptick in U.S. demand has coincided with a decline in business optimism by private jet operators, owners and financiers in China, according to a survey by Hong Kong-based business aviation specialist Asian Sky Group.
""My email is full of advertisements from brokers or inquiries from owners every day with aircraft for sale,"" Jackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based private jet consultancy JetSolution Aviation Group, said in an email.
Wu has seen a near-23 percent rise in sales from Greater China year-to-date, compared with the year-ago period, she said.
The biennial Airshow China, the country's largest, runs this week in the coastal city of Zhuhai, where Gulfstream and other planemakers are looking to sell new jets.
Among pre-owned Chinese planes recently sold, according to FlightAscend, are younger Gulfstream models such as the popular large-cabin G550, which can fly nonstop from Shanghai to Los Angeles.
Reuters could not determine the identity of the sellers or buyers.
Only 5 percent of the G550's worldwide fleet of 556 aircraft is for sale, according to data from Asian Sky Group. Typically, 6 to 9 percent of some 21,284 business jets worldwide can be found on the secondhand market, where dealers say the supply of pre-owned planes overall is shrinking, helping to prop up values.
Reuters could not determine prices for second-hand G550s, but according to industry data cited by JetSolution, the market price for a 10-year-old Gulfstream G450 is around $11 million compared with a $38.9 million list price in 2008.
According to FlightGlobal Values Analyzer data, business jets have lost an average of 7.1 percent in market value over the year. By contrast, business jets depreciated 11.6 percent from 2016 to 2017.

Last month, Reuters reported that cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] was selling its corporate ""Dream Jet"" sporting a ""seven-star"" hotel-style cabin.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>","India's finance minister says Mastercard, Visa losing out to local players","By Aditya Kalra and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's finance minister said on Thursday that Mastercard (N:MA) and Visa (N:V) were losing market share to domestic payments networks, months after Mastercard complained to the U.S. government that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was using nationalism to promote a local rival.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke about the surging growth of RuPay and Unified Payment Interface (UPI), which allows swift inter-bank fund transfers, on the second anniversary of Modi's shock decision to replace high-value bank notes in a bid to flush out untaxed wealth.
Modi has said when Indians use RuPay they were serving the country as its transaction fees stay within India and could help build roads, schools and hospitals, an endorsement that has worried Purchase, New York-based Mastercard, which is the world's second-largest payments processor.
""Today Visa and Mastercard are losing market share in India to indigenously developed payment system of UPI and RUPAY Card, whose share have reached 65 percent of the payments done through debit and credit cards,"" Jaitley said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post https://www.facebook.com/notes/arun-jaitley/impact-of-demonitisation/906015826253633 about the various results of the note scrapping exercise, known as demonetization.
Visa declined to comment. Mastercard did not respond to an email seeking comment.
RuPay process payments between banks and merchants for purchases made with credit or debit cards, while UPI instantly transfers funds between two bank accounts linked to mobile phones.
SOCIAL MEDIA BACKLASH
Jaitley was referring to the volume of transactions, not the value.
Though RuPay, owned by many Indian and foreign banks, accounts for more than half of India's 1 billion debit and credit cards, industry sources say Visa and Mastercard still process the vast majority of the value of payments transactions in the country. Indian payments transactions were worth $51 billion in August, according to central bank data.
Jaitley said RuPay's total transactions had leapt to 84.3 billion rupees ($1.16 billion) as of September, from 11 billion rupees before demonetization. Total transactions done using UPI had jumped to 598 billion rupees ($8.26 billion) from 500 million rupees in October 2016, around the time it was launched.
Reuters reported last week that Mastercard complained to the Office of the United States Trade Representative on June 21 that Modi ""associated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism, claiming it serves as 'kind of national service'.""
The Mastercard note said that while Modi’s digital payments push was “commendable”, the Indian government had adopted “a series of protectionist measures” to the detriment of global companies. 
The story sparked a backlash on social media against Mastercard in India, one of the world's biggest payments growth markets.
Several people said on Twitter they had asked their banks to replace their Mastercard with RuPay, with some using the hashtag #BoycottMastercard to voice their concerns.
One user posted a picture of a Mastercard cut into pieces, while another named Ramesh uploaded a graphic with a Mastercard logo on a toilet flush. A spokesman for the Delhi arm of Modi's ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, said he had asked his bank to cancel his Mastercard and switch to RuPay.
Mastercard did not respond to Reuters' emailed request for comment on the social media backlash.
Ashwani Mahajan, who heads an economic group, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which is linked to the ideological parent of Modi's party, said on Thursday that companies such as Mastercard should be ""competing with RuPay, not complaining to the U.S. government"".
""They have enjoyed their market share for so long, we have the right to protect and promote our economic interests,"" Mahajan told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were flat to slightly higher on Thursday, paring gains as a rally following the U.S. midterm elections sputtered while strong results from SocGen and Commerzbank and France's Sodexho soothed concerns about corporate earnings.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.3 percent at 1017 GMT, extending the previous session's gains. In early dealings, it had hit its highest since Oct. 10.
The leading index of euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) was flat, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) 0.2 percent higher.
""It's looking less robust in general,"" as investors take a more cautious stance ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest meeting later in the day, said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at CityIndex.
The banking and insurance indexes (SX7P) (SXIP) were among the top performing sectors, up 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.
Italy's third-largest lender Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) jumped 8.9 percent after its third-quarter net profit beat forecasts thanks to lower costs and an asset sale that helped offset flat fees and falling interest income.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and SocGen (PA:SOGN) were up 4 percent and 3 percent respectively after solid earnings updates.
Investors shrugged off news that UBS (S:UBSG), Switzerland's largest bank, faces another potentially costly legal battle as the U.S. Department of Justice draws up civil charges over the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
The bank has said it will contest any complaint vigorously.
Analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank reckon more than half of the 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) UBS has set aside for non-core legal risks was dedicated to the U.S. case. 
""UBS was one of the most high profile banks that hasn't suffered from DoJ investigation. It was one of the smaller issuers, which is may be why the DoJ has probably left them til last,"" said CityIndex's Odeluga.
Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was flying high after the world's second-biggest catering company's better-than-expected revenue. Shares in jumped 6.4 percent to their highest since March and on track for their best day since July. 
 Hikma Pharmaceuticals  (L:HIK) rallied 6.6 percent after raising its full-year revenue outlook for the injectibles division, its largest unit.
It wasn't all good news though. Shares of broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 (DE:PSMGn) plunged 15 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600, hitting lowest level in more than six years after cutting its dividend and warning on its full-year outlook. 

 Inmarsat  (L:ISA) sank 7.1 percent after its results revealed weakness in its maritime division.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China is squeezing itself into a gap in the market for aircraft seats - a low-key effort compared with plans for a Sino-Russian jetliner or the military might paraded at this week's Airshow China, but one that may earn it a key role in global supply chains.
Bottlenecks in the supply of seats have disrupted jetliner production and created a major headache for Western planemakers in recent years, as manufacturers struggled to keep up with booming air traffic and growing demand for customized cabin features.
Consolidation has already reshaped the market; first B/E Aerospace became part of U.S. business Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), then France's Zodiac Aerospace lost a bid to stay independent and got taken over by  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Now China is trying to secure its place in the new landscape. 
""It's a big opportunity,"" Wu Si, a sales manager at Jiatai Aircraft Equipment Co Ltd, a subsidiary of state aerospace giant AVIC, told Reuters.
China's expansion into seats reflects an ambition to build its position as a broad supplier to foreign planemakers while deepening the skills and post-sales experience needed to develop its own aircraft industry, analysts said.
The breakthrough is not immediately obvious at China's largest air show, where AVIC's seats are tucked in a corner beyond promotional displays for fighters.
Jiatai has been in the seats business since 1995, mainly supplying China-made aircraft like the Xian MA60 turboprop. It also equips the recently introduced ARJ21 regional jet. 
But it is speeding up its exposure to foreign markets, encouraged by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), who are still smarting from delays caused by a production crisis at Zodiac and are working to smooth seat supply.
PRESSURE ON ESTABLISHED SUPPLIERS
Last week, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that Airbus had delivered an A320 equipped with Jiatai seats for the first time.
And Boeing said at the show it had recently added Jiatai's products to the catalog of available seats for its best-selling 737 jet. The company has fitted out at least 25 Boeing jets since 2016.
The move ""continues the indirect pressure on traditional seats suppliers"" including Recaro, Zodiac and B/E Aerospace, Agency Partners said in a note.
Recent profit margins are a poor guide because of production problems, but in 2016, the last year before it was delisted, B/E Aerospace had an operating margin of 16.6 percent. In the same period, Airbus made 5.9 percent and Boeing 7.7 percent.
Analysts say margins are especially high on premium seats, but for now the Chinese business focuses mainly on economy seating.
Jiatai says it has capacity for 20,000 seats a year - enough for about 130 medium-haul jets - but is only making 13,000-14,000. It is adding a second production line.
The risk is that hurdles in certifying each new seat variant and maintaining output will prove even more challenging than it did for longtime specialist Zodiac, analysts said. 

""The problem is with orders. Airlines are so used to the status quo, preferring to upgrade with their existing seat choices. It takes time for the market to accept our brand,"" said Cai Li, a sales manager at Jiatai.

NEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), Switzerland's largest bank, faces another potentially costly legal battle as the U.S. Department of Justice draws up civil charges over the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
UBS said on Wednesday it expected to be sued by the Justice Department as early as Thursday. The bank said the claims were not supported by the facts or the law and it would contest any complaint vigorously.
Analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank said it was unclear how long the U.S. legal case might last and that it was hard to estimate what size fine UBS might face.
""It strikes us as important, though, that the matter is brought to a quick conclusion so that clarity prevails,"" it said in a research note, keeping its ""market weight"" recommendation.
The analysts said they thought more than half of the 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) UBS has set aside for non-core legal risks was dedicated to the U.S. case. 
UBS said in its statement on Wednesday it expected the DOJ to seek unspecified monetary penalties stemming from mortgage securities which date back to 2006 and 2007.
UBS shares rose 1 percent in morning trading, in line with the European banking sector index (SX7P).
The potential U.S. action is one of the last that deals with alleged misconduct in the sale and pooling of mortgage securities which helped to cause the financial crisis.
Vontobel analysts said UBS's relatively modest role in the mortgage-backed securities market stood in stark contrast to that of rival banks which had already settled with U.S. authorities.
The DOJ has settled similar claims with  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Credit Suisse  Group (S:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC).
Barclays reached a $2 billion settlement in March, one of the lower payouts by banks facing such claims. The British bank had resisted a penalty proposed in initial settlement negotiations, something UBS has also done.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) agreed to pay $765 million in October to settle with the Justice Department over its sale of defective mortgage securities, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS), a big player in the mortgage-backed market, reached a $4.9 billion deal in May.
UBS originated $1.5 billion of U.S. residential mortgages in a $5 trillion market and lost more than $45 billion when the housing market collapsed, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
In a court case in France, which UBS has chosen not settle, the bank is fighting money laundering and tax fraud charges over allegations it helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in France. UBS denies the charges.
If found guilty of money laundering, UBS could be fined up to 5 billion euros ($5.71 billion). It could also face damages awarded to the French taxman for the missing revenue, while its executives risk jail time.
The French state has asked for 1.6 billion euros in damages, which UBS has called excessive.
During the French investigation, UBS turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros made by the authorities, judicial sources have said.

Viktor Kladov, director for international cooperation and regional policy of Russian state conglomerate Rostec, made the comments on the sidelines of China's largest airshow.
Rostec, whose sprawling business includes weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov as well as Russian Helicopters and United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), is among Russian firms that have been affected by sanctions imposed on the country over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and other factors.
These sanctions have driven Moscow to try and rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. 
UAC last year kickstarted full-scale development of a wide-body jet with China that eventually aims to compete with Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) planes. Another Rostec subsidiary is also cooperating with Beijing to build an aero engine.
""Any big nation cannot afford being dependent on others...We are trying to acquire full independence in our capacities,"" Kladov told Reuters, adding he was referring to areas like technology and production capabilities for civil aircraft. 
""When you're dependent on just one source of supply, then you're not fully independent; you're reliant. Any monopoly is a wrong thing. When you have a choice, it's a good thing, then nobody can push you around.""
U.S. and European firms currently dominate the aerospace supply chain from engines to avionics and have been heavily involved in Russia's civil aircraft programs. 
The Irkut MC-21, a medium-range passenger plane that is being built by another Rostec unit, is powered by engines supplied by United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney. The company rolled out the plane for the first time in 2016. 
Kladov said the MC-21 was now undergoing certification and that developers hoped it could be fully operational and in service by the end of 2019. 

The company also hopes the MC-21 will be able to fly using Russia's self-developed Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine in one year, after the engine recently obtained certification, he added.

181,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi makes $1 billion bid for partnership with South Africa defense group Denel,"By Joe Bavier and Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has made a $1 billion bid for a broad partnership with South African state-owned defense group Denel that would include acquisition of a minority stake in a joint venture with Germany's  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG), a source familiar with the offer said.
Currently heavily dependent on imports, Saudi Arabia, the world's third-largest defense spender, is seeking partnerships to develop its own domestic defense industry with the goal of localizing half of its military spending by 2030. 
Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), the kingdom's state defense company, told Reuters last month that it was in discussions with all major South African firms and aimed to conclude the first deals by the end of this year.
According to the source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, Saudi Arabia was targeting Denel's 49 percent stake in Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM).
RDM is a South African-based joint venture formed in 2008 between Denel and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH, which holds the remaining 51 percent stake. It specializes in the development, design and manufacture of medium and large-caliber ammunition including artillery shells.
A Rheinmetall spokesman declined to comment. The German government is currently reviewing all arms sales to Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Industry sources said RDM operates independently and is subject to South African law, which means exports from the unit are not subject to German government oversight. The sources said they did not expect that a change in the ownership of the venture would require a German government review.
Under the Saudi offer, SAMI would also finance research and development in other Denel divisions including Denel Dynamics, which develops and produces tactical missiles and precision guided weapons. 
Denel and SAMI would share intellectual property and under a new joint venture would target defense export markets in the Middle East and North Africa.
Finally, Saudi Arabia - already a top Denel customer for military vehicles, artillery munitions and radar equipment - would purchase a certain amount of the group's production. The Saudis expect an answer from the South African authorities by the end of December.
""Saudi Arabia has made a unique business proposition to the South African government. As our discussions are not finalised yet we cannot provide any comment,"" SAMI CEO Andreas Schwer wrote in response to Reuters' questions.
""RIPE FOR PARTNERSHIPS""
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last week said Denel was ""ripe for joint-venture partnerships"". But he added that the government had not yet weighed the Saudi bid or proposals from what he said were a number of other suitors looking to partner with Denel.
A Denel spokesperson would not comment on any specific bid, saying that such negotiations take place on a state-to-state basis. 
Ramaphosa's spokeswoman Khusela Diko said the president would only make a decision on the Saudi offer to partner with Denel once it was discussed by cabinet. 
""No decision has been made yet,"" Diko told Reuters.
The source with knowledge of the Saudi bid told Reuters that Rheinmetall informally approached Denel's board last year aiming to deepen its collaboration with the company. 
The source said Rheinmetall had, like Saudi Arabia, expressed interest in acquiring Denel's minority stake in RDM and other Denel divisions but was rebuffed.
Rheinmetall declined to comment.
Denel is grappling with an acute liquidity crunch and is struggling to pay salaries and deliver on roughly 18 billion rand ($1.29 billion) of outstanding orders. 
Following seven years of modest profits, the company said last week it had made an operating loss of 1.7 billion rand in the 2017/18 financial year.
Sector observers say finding an equity partner is essential to Denel's survival. 
However, the interest in the company from Saudi Arabia, which is accused of committing abuses in the war in Yemen and has admitted responsibility for Khashoggi's death, has spawned public debate in South Africa. 

South African Foreign Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said last month human rights would be considered in any deliberations over a potential Saudi deal.

182,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Danske Faces ‘Years’ of Damage Control as Bank Replaces Chairman,"(Bloomberg) -- The man poised to become chairman of  Danske Bank  A/S (CO:DANSKE) is aware that the task ahead is huge.
If elected to the post this month, Karsten Dybvad says he and the board will spend the “coming years” trying to “restore confidence in the bank.”
The 62-year-old trained economist has been handpicked by Danske’s biggest shareholder, A.P. Moller Holding A/S. The investor wants Dybvad to replace Ole Andersen, who it says was too slow in dealing with the fallout of one of Europe’s worst ever money laundering scandals.
Investors are instead about to get a man who spent years as a civil servant wandering the halls of power popularized in the TV series Borgen. Dybvad, who’s currently the head of the Confederation of Danish Industry, has had a very different career path from his predecessor.
Different Strokes
Andersen, who is the same age as Dybvad, was a financier who climbed the ranks targeting senior positions in private equity before turning the role of chairman into a life’s work at some of Denmark’s biggest companies. He still sits at the head of the board of Danish luxury TV and stereo maker Bang & Olufsen A/S.
But Andersen, once a giant in Denmark’s corporate circles, is now associated with one of the biggest scandals to hit the country this century. Under his watch, Danske has become the subject of multiple criminal investigations, including in the U.S., amid allegations it laundered billions of dollars, much of it from Russia.
Danske has admitted that a large part of about $230 billion that flowed through a tiny Estonian unit was probably suspicious in origin. Dybvad says that the business leaders he’s spoken with have expressed “deep worries” about what has happened to Danske. The concerns have been “universal,” he said.
For the Danes, the crisis surrounding their biggest bank has been a seminal moment. “This bank is a keystone in Denmark,” Dybvad said. Even the name -- Danske literally means Danish -- is a part of the nation’s identity, he said.
Gauging the Indignation
A.P. Moller Holding used its 20 percent stake in Danske to convene an extraordinary general meeting, due to take place within two weeks. Andersen’s won’t be the only head to roll, with the main investor pushing for several changes to the board.
Dybvad says he’s spoken not just with corporate leaders to gauge the level of indignation, but also with regular Danes. “I have experienced very many Danes expressing concern,” he said.
The chairman’s first task will be to try to find a chief executive officer for Danske. Andersen botched the process after his protege, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, was rejected by the Danish regulator, which deemed the 40-year-old head of wealth management too inexperienced for the job. (Thomas Borgen was removed as CEO in October for his role in the laundering scandal.)
Dybvad didn’t want to discuss his thoughts on a possible candidate for the CEO, underscoring again that he still hasn’t been elected chairman.
Ultimately, the latest developments at Danske underscore the fact that “it’s the shareholders actually deciding who sits on the board,” he said. “And they’ve made a decision and the implications of that should be very clear.”

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Queensland state is set to unveil proposed resource regulations next week that will require miners to pay into an ""insurance fund"" for the remediation of old mines.
The regulations, if enacted, will impact the likes of BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT),  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), which all have operations in the mineral-rich state. The new rules would be the most significant reform of the state's rehabilitation framework in nearly two decades, the Queensland government said.
""I'm confident this legislation strikes the right balance for the environment and the resources sector, while ensuring resource companies, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the rehabilitation of failed mines or stranded assets,"" Deputy Premier Jackie Trad said in a statement.
""All miners (will) have to pay into what is essentially an insurance fund to ensure that mine rehabilitation ... happens in Queensland and we don't leave a legacy for future generations where there are abandoned mines,"" she told local radio.
Queensland is one of the largest seaborne exporters of coal in the world, and is also in the world's top five regions for producing zinc, lead, bauxite - which is made into aluminum - and silver.
The amendments to the regulation, first proposed in October 2017, will be introduced into parliament for debate next week.
Top global miner BHP Billiton Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had been in protracted consultations with the state government over the issue.
""We have found it a relatively sensible debate and clearly we are not in support of everything that is being proposed, but we actually feel listened to and we understand why we have to have the discussion,"" Mackenzie told reporters during a briefing following the company's AGM in Adelaide on Thursday.
Queensland's resources sector adds more than $55 billion to the state's bottom line and contributes more than $4 billion in royalties, according to the Queensland Resources Council.
Shane Goodwin, head of corporate affairs at Australia's New Century Resources (AX:NCZ), which is currently remediating what was once the world's biggest zinc mine by reprocessing waste material and exporting it, said the legislation was supportive for the industry and for smaller miners.
Among amendments the state was considering was allowing some miners to post insurance bonds in place of large cash holdings, which are particularly painful for small to medium size players in the capital intensive industry.
""This new legislation from our perspective is very beneficial and for the whole industry is beneficial as well,"" Goodwin said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (T:6502) announced on Thursday it is shedding assets, cutting jobs and buying back its stock starting this week, sending its shares up 13 percent, as the once-mighty Japanese conglomerate aims to regain investor confidence. 
The company announced it is liquidating its British nuclear power unit and selling its U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) business to China's ENN Group as part of a new five-year business strategy, which also includes 7,000 job cuts, or 5 percent of its workforce, over five years.
Toshiba's shares surged 12.7 percent to close near two-year highs after the announcement, helped also by a much anticipated move to repurchase up to 40 percent of its own shares starting Friday. 
The 143-year-old company has been trying to win back the market's trust after a 2015 accounting scandal uncovered widespread irregularities at the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate for years. 
The scandal forced it to recognize huge cost overruns at now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, prompting it to sell its prized memory chip unit earlier this year to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and leaving it with few growth businesses.
""There had been reports about a possibility of selling non-performing business and job cuts so such moves had been expected at some point. But investors are taking heart,"" said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of Investrust, a financial advice firm. 
""The share buyback announcement worth up to 40 percent of outstanding shares is definitely positive, too.""
Toshiba had already promised a share buyback of 700 billion yen earlier this year, but the timing had been undecided. Its announcement on Thursday appeared to outweigh a weaker profit forecast - the company said it now expects a full-year operating profit of 60 billion yen rather than a previous estimate of 70 billion yen. 
STEMMING LOSSES
Toshiba had been trying to shed the troubled assets that could have exposed the Japanese company to future losses.
The decision to liquidate NuGen, however, would be a blow to Britain's plans to build a nuclear plant that was meant to provide 7 percent of the country's electricity. 
NuGen said 18 months of negotiations with a range of potential owners had failed to yield any deal, and that it was now up to the British government and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to determine the future of the Moorside site in Cumbria.
South Korea's state-run Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (KS:015760) had been in talks with Toshiba to buy a stake in NuGen. South Korea's energy ministry said on Thursday it will coordinate with the British government and monitor the liquidation process with KEPCO.
Toshiba said it will sell the LNG business to ENN Ecological Holdings (SS:600803), a unit of Chinese gas company ENN Group. 
It has spent years trying to either sell the gas to power customers or offload the business after signing a 20-year contract to buy LNG from Freeport in a venture announced in 2013. Asian LNG prices  have plunged 42 percent in the past five years, raising fears of future losses.
Toshiba will be paying the buyer $821 million to assume its commitment to purchase 2.2 million tonnes per year of the fuel from Freeport LNG in Texas - a cost booked as a charge for the current financial year.

The company said its exit from the troubled businesses, along with the job cuts and other restructuring moves, will help it bolster its profitability in the longer run. It forecast an operating profit of 240 billion yen in fiscal 2021 compared to 60 billion yen in the current year.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said Thursday it will join the mushrooming micro-mobility movement with the acquisition of 2-year-old Spin, an electric scooter rental firm based in San Francisco.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker, one of the first to enter the sector, will invest about $200 million in Spin, according to a source familiar with the acquisition.
The purchase price is dwarfed by investments in — and valuations awarded to — Lime and Bird, the U.S. market leaders in a sector that only started to accelerate about eight months ago.
Lime, based in San Mateo, California, was founded in 2017 and has drawn more than $450 million in funding, at a valuation of more than $4 billion. Its investors include ride services giant Uber [UBER.UL] and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL).
Bird, based in Santa Monica, also was launched in 2017. It has attracted $400 million in investments and is valued at $2 billion.
In an interview, Marcy Klevorn, president of Ford's mobility unit, said the acquisition of Spin ""fills a gap in our mobility portfolio,"" while providing ""accessible and affordable transportation"" in cities and on college campuses.
Spin and its rivals follow a simple business model. They buy e-scooters — think of a child's kick-start scooter equipped with an electric motor and a wireless internet connection — for $100-$300 each from manufacturers such as China's Ninebot, then rent them for short distances and short periods of time via mobile phone apps, typically at a flat rate of $1 plus 15 cents a minute.
After launching in the Bay Area, e-scooters are beginning to roll out in many big cities across the United States.
Ford plans to expand Spin over the next 18 months, from 32 markets to more than 100 in North America, according to Sundeep Madra, head of the automaker's Ford X startup incubator.
Klevorn said e-scooters complement Ford's product portfolio, including the full-size F-series pickup that generates the lion's share of Ford's profit.
""Our overall strategy is to provide customers with a choice, whether it's buy or lease (a vehicle) or pay by use,"" Klevorn said. ""We're trying to adapt to where the market is going — and scooters complement that.""
Spin will be a wholly owned Ford subsidiary, operating out of San Francisco.

Last week, General Motors Co (N:GM) said it planned to introduce a pair of electric bicycles in 2019 but so far has not said whether it plans to enter the e-scooter business.

Yields on the securities extended an increase this week after La Repubblica newspaper reported the EU Commission sees slower growth lifting the country’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio to 2.9 percent next year instead of the government’s 2.4 percent target. The shortfall could then breach the bloc’s 3 percent limit in 2020, the newspaper said.
Italy’s bonds have stabilized since avoiding being downgraded to junk by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Global Ratings last month, though frictions with the European Union could derail the recovery. The nation’s leaders have until Nov. 13 to submit revised spending plans after the Commission rejected their initial proposals.
Ten-year yields rose three basis points to 3.37 percent, with the spread over those on their German peers climbing two basis points to 291 basis points.
The Commission projects that economic growth could be one third lower than the 1.5 percent targeted by the coalition government for next year, La Repubblica reported, without saying how it obtained the information.

Wall Street's main indexes rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday, led by the technology and healthcare sectors as the market breathed a sigh of relief after the U.S. midterm elections, in which Democrats wrested control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retained the Senate. (N)
""Going forward, we think the removal of uncertainty and realization of the expected outcome should be supportive for risk assets,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a report.
While a divided Congress will make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislation, such as additional tax cuts, investors do not expect a reversal of recently enacted tax cuts and deregulation.
""The key point after the midterm elections is that U.S. stocks showed they had developed immunity towards higher yields. The last time long-term Treasury yields were at this level a month ago, they had helped trigger a major fall by stocks,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Steady U.S. fundamentals will support this trend of equities and yields rising in tandem, which should also prop up the dollar in the longer term.""
The 10-year Treasury note yield  rose to 3.25 percent on Wednesday, its highest since Oct. 9, with Wall Street's rally reducing demand for safe-haven debt. It last stood at 3.23 percent.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.2 percent to 96.177 (DXY), pulling back from 95.678 plumbed on Wednesday, its lowest since Oct. 22.
That low for the greenback was driven by a knee-jerk reaction to the U.S. midterm election results, with a divided Congress seen dulling Trump's fiscal stimulus drive.
Some focus was also on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy due later on Thursday. The Fed, however, is not expected to hike interest rates until its next gathering in December and analysts expected this meeting to have limited market impact.
The central bank has tightened monetary policy three times in 2018, with the latest rate hike coming in September.
""A split Congress is unlikely to materially alter the Fed's near-term hiking trajectory and the Fed will be biased to keep raising rates until the data or financial conditions turn,"" strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) wrote.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>",Securities lending boom sparks concerns on returns and voting,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Securities lending by investment funds has reached its highest level in a decade, as demand for corporate bonds surged more than 30 percent over the past 18 months and short selling of Tesla (O:TSLA) and  Alibaba  (N:BABA) shares reaches a frenzy.
Global money managers generated nearly $6 billion in revenue during the first half of the year, loaning out stocks and bonds that often land in the hands of short-sellers such as hedge funds. It was the best performance since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008 and current volatility trends are expected to keep the upswing going, according to research firm IHS Markit.
New regulatory disclosure rules that took effect last year and fresh academic research show, however, there can be a bigger downside to securities lending than previously thought.
For one, mutual funds may overweight high-demand stocks and bonds because they generate higher fees from short-selling hedge funds. Securities lending, especially for money managers keeping a bigger portion of the fees from fund investors, could distort stock-picking behavior and hurt performance, said Travis Johnson, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
""(Our research) shows there is a wrong way to do this: Collect up to 30 percent of the securities lending fees and bias your investment decisions,"" he said.
BlackRock Inc's (N:BLK) securities lending revenue surged 14 percent to $338 million during the first half of the year, compared to the year-ago period. The company's in-house securities lending agent keeps typically 20 percent to 30 percent of fees paid by borrowers. Investors in BlackRock's largely passive funds receive the balance of the fees, though a lower percentage than at many other rival funds, U.S. regulatory filings show.
Boston-based Fidelity Investments typically keeps about 10 percent and Vanguard Group does not charge a securities lending agent fee, though administrative expenses range between 1 percent and 2 percent. Investors in Fidelity and Vanguard funds get the difference.
BlackRock's fund investors can get more income than rivals, however, because there is more securities lending revenue to divide. ""BlackRock's returns are often the strongest in the industry,"" spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said.
Joseph Chi, co-head of portfolio management at Dimensional Fund Advisors, said there is research that shows that high-demand stocks that borrowers are paying high fees on tend to underperform the market. The underperformance is generally in line with the fee paid by the borrower to the fund loaning the stock, he said. Yet if a fund company's securities lending agent is keeping a large percentage of the revenue, what investors get may fall short of making up for the stock's underperformance, Chi said.
Mutual funds and pension funds have long lent their securities to short-sellers to boost income for investors. In some cases, the borrowing fees can be substantial, offsetting most or all of a fund's operating expenses.
The DFA Emerging Markets Small Cap Portfolio (O:DEMSX) generated $28.5 million in securities lending income during the six-month period that ended April 30. That was more than the fund's $25.2 million in total expenses, giving investors a boost of nearly 0.4 percent on net assets of $7.25 billion, fund disclosures show.
MISSING VOTES
Another drawback to securities lending is how borrowed shares affect pivotal corporate elections, such as takeover proposals because asset managers who loan their shares give up their right to vote attached to those shares.
Bruce Goldfarb, president of Okapi Partners, a so-called ""proxy solicitor"" who rounds up votes in corporate elections, said the widespread lending of stock for short-selling often factors in those elections.
A common way this plays out, Goldfarb said, is when corporate leaders forget that an asset manager may not have as many available votes as their listed portfolio holdings suggest. Goldfarb said this probably happened in 2014 when he represented hedge fund Casablanca Capital in its successful takeover of miner Cliffs Natural Resources, now Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (N:CLF). 
""We couldn’t understand why the company was so confident"" it would win the contest, Goldfarb said. James Kirsch, Cliffs' chairman at the time, declined to comment.
Fund managers can recall loaned-out shares for voting, but that option is often weighed against the extra money to be made from securities lending. Regulatory disclosures suggest asset managers often choose the money. ""We believe that, generally, the likely economic value of casting most votes is less than the securities lending income,"" BlackRock said in an Oct. 26 fund disclosure.

Paul Hodgson, an independent corporate governance consultant, said most fund investors would welcome the extra revenue, but some would be disappointed their manager had given up control of the votes. ""I think there would be a substantial minority of clients who would say, 'that's not why I invested my pension',"" he said.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>","Australian wealth giant AMP, under pressure, says tougher laws would 'distract'","By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Struggling Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) fears any new regulation of the finance sector would ""distract"" participants from acting ethically, it said on Thursday, striking a defiant tone after months of damaging allegations.
The country's biggest-listed wealth manager also rejected suggestions that Australia's largest financial firms had failed to make sufficient effort to stop charging customers fees without providing services.
The comments came in an unusually combative reply to a scathing interim report on the conduct of Australia's financial industry from a government inquiry which has shocked the country with revelations of widespread wrongdoing. Most of the major banks have said they will support any new laws.
""There is every chance that adding a new layer of law and regulation would serve only to distract attention from the very simple ideas that must inform the conduct of financial services entities,"" AMP said in a written response to the Royal Commission's interim report.
""The more complicated the law, the easier it is to lose sight of them,"" AMP added.
The independent Royal Commission inquiry is widely expected to recommend sweeping reforms to financial services regulation when it wraps up in February.
It has heard evidence of poor governance and misconduct including the taking fees from dead people's accounts, forging signatures to sell loans to small businesses, and forcing farmers into insolvency to avoid exposure to drought. 
AMP admitted to charging customers fees without providing a service, then tampering with a supposedly independent report to a regulator about the practice. The firm's CEO, chairwoman and several directors stepped down following the revelations.
The firm's shares are down 50 percent since the start the year, wiping A$7.5 billion ($5.5 billion) from its market value.
The 170-year-old company now faces five class-action lawsuits on behalf of shareholders, an Australian record.
AMP defended its business model, saying that the fees it charged to invest people's retirement savings left customers better off. The Royal Commission has heard that low-fee-charging default industry funds routinely return more money to policyholders than fee-charging private funds like AMP.
A ban on pension fund fees ""would have a significant negative impact on customers and result in unintended detrimental consequences including making financial advice less affordable ... to those who need it most"", AMP said.
The company also rebuked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the corporate regulator, saying there was an ""inherent conflict of interest in relation to ASIC receiving the fines ... that they impose on the financial services sector"".

The Royal Commission resumes hearings later this month.

The move comes as Tencent, the world's largest gaming company by revenue, and its peers have faced rising regulatory push back from Chinese authorities, which have not approved any new games since March.
""Marketing funds have been chopped back,"" said one of the people, an executive with Tencent Games, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. It was not immediately known by how much the budget had been reduced.
Bloomberg earlier reported, citing an internal letter, that Tencent was cutting branding budgets for gaming and that games without government licenses would have to return their unspent money to the group.
In the internal memo, staff were told the move would help the company ""endure the hard times together"", Bloomberg said.
Tencent declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
The social media-to-payments firm has made a series of attempts to meet Beijing's call for tighter controls to combat gaming addiction and increasing near-sightedness among young people.

Authorities in August called for the publishing regulator to control the number of new online video games and to limit the amount of time young Chinese spend playing such games.

The company will offer Black Friday deals at 10 p.m. EST online on Thanksgiving eve - two hours earlier than in previous years - in order to give shoppers on the East Coast more shopping time earlier, executives said, and at 6 p.m. local time in its stores on Thanksgiving Day.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also have deals available on Walmart.com beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thursday, Nov. 8, the company said.
Similar to in years past, key departments, like toys, electronics, home and apparel, will be color-coded in store so shoppers can easily find deals. The codes will be available on the retailer’s Black Friday circular and store maps.
""Check Out With Me"" associates – identifiable with a bright yellow sash – will also be placed in key areas of the store in an effort to make the shopping experience smoother.
For years, Black Friday has marked the start of the holiday shopping season in the United States with retailers offering steep discounts. But its popularity has been on the wane with the rise of online shopping and inexpensive deals throughout the year.

On Monday, Amazon said it would offer free shipping with no purchase minimum for the first time this holiday season, heating up the competition with Walmart Inc and Target, which in recent years have chipped away at Amazon's lead with their own offers of free two-day shipping. While Walmart has maintained its $35 order threshold this holiday, Target has scrapped its minimum until Dec. 22.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 09:44PM ET</span>",UBS expects to be sued by U.S. Justice Department over crisis-era mortgage securities,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - UBS Group AG, Switzerland's largest bank, said it expects to be sued by the U.S. Department of Justice as early as Thursday on civil charges related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis, according to a company statement.
The bank said the claims were not supported by the facts or the law and it would contest any such complaint ""vigorously."" 
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
UBS said the Justice Department advised the bank that it intends to file the lawsuit. It anticipates the Justice Department will seek unspecified monetary penalties stemming from mortgage securities which date back to 2006 and 2007.
The lawsuit against UBS, a small originator of U.S. residential mortgages at the time, is among the last actions over misconduct in the sale and pooling of mortgage securities which helped to cause the financial crisis. 
In recent years, the Justice Department has settled similar claims with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.
Barclays settled for $2 billion in March after resisting a penalty the U.S. government sought near the end of the Obama administration in 2016. Justice had sought a much higher fine at the time and, when the two sides could not come to terms, the department filed a lawsuit. 
More recently,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) agreed to pay $765 million in October to settle with the Justice Department over its sale of defective mortgage securities before the crisis, while major player Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc reached a $4.9 billion deal in May.
After the crisis, banks were accused of deceiving investors about the quality of loans underlying the mortgage-backed securities they pooled and sold, with loans made to borrowers with no ability to repay them and based on inflated home appraisals.

Google's deal to buy or lease 1.3 million-square-foot office building at St. John's Terminal could house nearly double the search giant's current staffing in the city, WSJ reported.
The plan, would give Google room for nearly 20,000 staff in the city, including those it has now, WSJ said.
Google's reported plan for expansion in New York comes at a time when Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) could add 25,000 jobs if it chooses the city as one of the sites for a major new office.
Amazon said in September last year that it was seeking a site for a second corporate headquarters that would eventually employ up to 50,000 people. But it now plans to split its new headquarters between two sites, including Long Island City in New York, sources told Reuters.
Google, which already employs about 7,000 in the city, has its New York headquarters at 111 Eighth Avenue, one of the city's largest buildings that it bought in 2010.
Google also plans to expand its existing property at Chelsea Market by about 300,000 square feet, WSJ said citing people briefed with the matter.
Google declined to comment on the matter.
Google closed a $2.4 billion deal to buy New York's Chelsea Market in March, expanding the company's presence in the city's technology corridor along the Hudson River.

Owner of the St. John's Terminal, Oxford Properties Group, did not respond immediately with a comment.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 09:19PM ET</span>",Samsung gives first glimpse of foldable phone,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Munsif Vengattil
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) unveiled its much-anticipated foldable phone in San Francisco on Wednesday, urging Android developers to start writing apps for it.
The South Korean tech company needs to get the foldable phone right to reverse steep declines in profit for its mobile division and restore some of the cachet its brand has lost to Apple Inc (O:AAPL). 
Foldable phones promise the screen of a small tablet in a pocket-sized device. 
Justin Denison, a senior vice president of mobile product marketing, showed a prototype with a screen he said measured 7.3 inches (18.5 cm) diagonally.
Folded in two it appeared to resemble a thick phone, but Samsung did not give media or developers a chance to touch or see the device up close.
Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Google's Android software platform, told a Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) conference in California that Samsung planned to introduce a new Android-based device early next year.
""We expect to see foldable products from several Android manufacturers,"" he said. 
Google's head of Android UX, Glen Murphy, was also on stage with Samsung and said Google would work with the developer community to bring more features to the phone.
Samsung said it would be ready for mass production in the coming months. 
Developer Joshua Clark, who was at the conference, said Samsung needs to sell the technology to its competitors for the product to be widely adopted.
""I really think it only takes two companies, and then all of the sudden it will catch on,"" said Clark. ""And the fact that Google was on stage, that says a lot. For developers to be able to integrate it with all their apps, that gives me a lot of confidence.""
Analyst Bob O’Donnell with Technalysis Research said that while the bendable screen provided a wow factor, shoppers may not like the thickness of the folded phone or its price tag.
""They'll have to prove that it's more than just a gimmick,"" said O'Donnell. ""But it’s smart to open it up to developers early to do different types of experiences."" 
Maribel Lopez, an analyst at Lopez Research, said that the product would likely be relatively expensive in the near term.
""We're talking about brand new materials that have been made for this and also a new manufacturing process,"" said Lopez.
Samsung is among a handful of developers working on foldable phones. 
China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has said it is planning to launch a 5G smartphone with a foldable screen in mid-2019.

Samsung and Huawei, however, have been beaten to the market by Royole, a Chinese display making start-up, which last week unveiled a foldable Android phone with a 7.8 inch screen, priced from around $1,300. Royole said it would start filling orders in late December.

Democrats won control of the House of Representatives while Republicans retained their hold on the Senate, as the U.S. midterm election's outcome split Congress.
""With trade tensions to the fore over recent months and risk currencies in the spotlight, the U.S. Mid-Terms were being seen through the prism of whether the outcome might embolden the President to go harder on trade or in effect if the elections would clip his wings,"" David de Garis, a director and senior economist at National Australia Bank, said in a morning note.
""With the Democrats gaining control over the House, the latter scenario now might be a little more likely,"" said de Garis.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he would work with Democrats on policy initiatives in order to promote economic growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of large institutional investors including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Allianz SE's (DE:ALVG) Pacific Investment Management Co has sued 16 major banks, accusing them of rigging prices in the roughly $5.1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.
The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan by plaintiffs that decided to ""opt out"" of similar nationwide litigation that has resulted in $2.31 billion of settlements with 15 of the banks.
Those settlements followed worldwide regulatory probes that have led to more than $10 billion of fines for several banks, and the convictions or indictments of some traders.
The banks being sued are: Bank of America,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Japan's MUFG Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and UBS.
Investors typically opt out of litigation when they hope to recover more by suing on their own.
The plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit accused the banks of violating U.S. antitrust law by conspiring from 2003 to 2013 to rig currency benchmarks including the WM/Reuters Closing Rates for their own benefit by sharing confidential orders and trading positions.
This manipulation was allegedly done through chat rooms with such names as ""The Cartel,"" ""The Mafia"" and ""The Bandits' Club,"" through tactics with such names as ""front running,"" ""banging the close,"" ""painting the screen"" and ""taking out the filth.""
""By colluding to manipulate FX prices, benchmarks, and bid/ask spreads, defendants restrained trade, decreased competition, and artificially increased prices, thereby injuring plaintiffs,"" the 221-page complaint said.
Norway's central bank Norges Bank and the big public pension fund California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) are among the several other named plaintiffs.
Many of the plaintiffs plan to pursue similar litigation in London against many of the bank defendants with respect to trades in Europe, a footnote in the complaint said.
Citigroup's $402 million settlement is the largest in the earlier litigation. Credit Suisse has yet to settle that case. Neither had an immediate comment on Wednesday's lawsuit.
The law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan represents the opt-out investors.

The case is Allianz Global Investors GMBH et al v Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-10364.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Automakers need standards for key equipment, a wide-reaching 5G broadband network and strong partnerships to make self-driving cars and electric vehicles a success, top European car industry executives said on Wednesday.
Ralf Speth, chief executive of Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO), outlined ambitious plans to stay ahead of the rapidly changing technological changes, but said the sector also needed unified and clear guidelines for safeguarding driver information and privacy.
Government and industry should work closely together to ensure success as the market evolves, Speth told a conference hosted by Automobilwoche magazine in Berlin.
European carmakers are racing to keep up with the rapid pace of development in the self-driving and electric vehicle markets in the United States and China.
The changes sweeping the industry promise to bring ""enormous progress to humanity,"" with autonomous cars offering mobility to many people now locked out of driving, such as the elderly and those with disabilities, Speth said.
But carmakers and suppliers would increasingly have to forge partnerships to meet the technological challenges involved, he said.
""No company alone can master challenges such as autonomous driving and connectivity on its own,"" Speth told Reuters after the conference, adding that companies will also need to keep investing in improving conventional engines, which will continue to power a majority of vehicles for years.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are in ""exploratory talks"" to jointly develop self-driving and electric vehicles in a far-reaching strategic alliance meant to save the companies billions of dollars, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
Speth also called for industry-wide standards for charging stations and cords, as well as vehicle communication systems.
One area of concern was the production of batteries for electric cars, Speth and other executives said.
Oliver Blume, chief executive of the Porsche division of Volkswagen, said demand for batteries would be so great in coming years that it could not be met by current suppliers. 
""We will definitely need intelligent partnerships,"" he said.
Detlev Mohr, senior partner with consulting firm McKinsey, said in an interview that he expected to see increased efforts to strengthen the supply chain - especially in the battery sector - in Germany and neighboring countries over the next two years.

""I hope that it won't be too late. We certainly need acceleration and a more decisive approach. The setting of strategic goals is good, but the implementation is what will ultimately make the difference,"" he said.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Garnier goes organic in L'Oreal bid to lift mass market sales,"PARIS (Reuters) - L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is rolling out organic skincare treatments at its Garnier brand as it looks to lift sales in its sluggish mass market unit, tapping a growing demand for more naturally-sourced products that is upending industries from cosmetics to food. 
The French beauty firm has been investing like peers in bio-friendly ointments to make headway in a fast-growing niche still dominated by small, specialized companies that got a headstart on larger rivals. 
But the launch is also part of efforts to revitalize the group's consumer products division, where growth is slow compared to its thriving luxury brands such as Lancome. 
Momentum has faltered in the division even as its Maybelline make-up and L'Oreal Paris labels do well in markets like China. Its third pillar, Garnier, however, is struggling from a lack of new ranges and its exposure to a tough Brazilian market. 
The organic range, which includes anti-ageing creams made from a lavender derivative and lemongrass face cleaners, are due to hit shelves in France and Western Europe as of early 2019, L'Oreal said. It did not comment on whether they would be exported further. 
L'Oreal, which also launched an entirely new organic cosmetics range, La Provencale, for the French mass market in October, said it aimed to bring the products to a wide audience, with prices for the Garnier ranges capped at 10 euros ($11.47). 
""We saw that there was a gap between what was on offer and very strong demand among consumers for natural, organic products,"" said Celine Brucker, head of L'Oreal's consumer products division for France. 
Though still small - organic products made up under two percent of the French cosmetics market in the year to end-September, according to consultancy IRI - it's one of the fastest growing segments. 
Global sales rose 35.4 percent over that period, compared to a 1.4 percent fall in the broader beauty and hygiene market that also comprises products like sanitary towels, IRI said. 
Consumers growing increasingly wary of chemicals in their beauty treatments also have more tools at their disposals to research brands, including mobile phone apps that scan products and list toxic ingredients. 
L'Oreal bought vegan beauty manufacturer Logocos Naturkosmetik in August as part of its push, and this year launched its first entirely-plant based hair dye for use by salon professionals.
At one point L'Oreal owned Britain's The Body Shop, one of the pioneers of ethical and natural cosmetics, but the business struggled as competition in the segment rose and it was sold off last year to Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos.

The company's mass market division posted 2.3 percent sales growth in the third quarter, unchanged from three months earlier. CEO Jean-Paul Agon said the performance was ""still under what we wanted to achieve"", but added he saw signs of improvement in the months ahead. ($1 = 0.8719 euros)

210,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 06:09PM ET</span>",Qualcomm forecast falls short as Apple sales disappear,"By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) forecast sales revenue for the holiday shopping quarter below analysts' estimates on Wednesday as it took a hit from the loss of chip sales to Apple Inc (O:AAPL), sending its shares down 3.4 percent.
The San Diego chipmaker also forecast its fiscal 2019 first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, but the better-than-expected outlook was largely due to a one-time tax benefit of about 45 cents per share. 
Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of chips for smartphones but it has been battered by a slowdown in the industry and the loss of major customer Apple. 
It has also faced repeated challenges to a patent licensing model where it takes a cut of the selling price of a mobile phone, both from antitrust regulators and from customers including Apple, which is suing Qualcomm over its practices.
The iPhone maker has excluded Qualcomm from its new iPhones XS and XS Max and XR that launched in September, instead choosing modem chips from rival  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
Earlier this summer, Qualcomm warned its shareholders that Apple would likely make that move, but the impact has shown up more swiftly than Wall Street expected.
For Qualcomm's fiscal first quarter that ends in December, the chip firm forecast revenue of between $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that about half of Apple's chip purchases tended to come during the holiday quarter. Davis said Wall Street analysts may have expected the blow from the Apple loss to be more spread out over the year.
""Our guidance has a reduction of over 50 million (chip) units in the quarter, all of that explained by the absence of being in Apple phones,"" Davis told Reuters. ""That's really the difference.""
On the profit side, Davis said the adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 included a 45-cent-per-share benefit from a tax restructuring that would not repeat.
""Net-net, it's not a disaster,"" said analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group. ""I think Qualcomm can build from here on out with 5G and growth in its adjacent businesses"" such as chips for automobiles, Chan said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple is not in talks ""at any level"" to settle the litigation with Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter. Davis said there was ""a lot of focus both internally and externally"" on resolving the dispute with licensees, which include Apple, but did not comment on whether the two were in talks about a settlement.
Qualcomm has tried to offset some of the woes related to Apple and the lawsuits by signing more deals with customers that effectively let them pay lower patent licensing rates. It has also reached new deals with large customers like  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930).
Also offsetting the Apple impact is a slew of new partnerships between Qualcomm and Chinese mobile phone makers including  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, all of which offer lower-cost models in emerging markets like India.
Davis said those Chinese phone makers are increasingly making higher-priced devices that use Qualcomm's 700- and 800-series Snapdragon chips, which helped improve sales.
""Even though we made some changes to the licensing program that allowed customers to effectively have a lower rate, that came back to us in the form of higher (chip) unit sales,"" Davis said.
Qualcomm is also seeking to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That effort suffered a setback this week when a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling saying Qualcomm must license its patents to chip industry rivals such as Intel Corp (O:INTC). 
In a conference call with investors, Qualcomm legal chief Don Rosenberg said settlement talks with the FTC are proceeding despite the ruling.
Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 90 cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, beating analysts' estimates of 83 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Revenue fell to $5.80 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, but was still above estimates of $5.52 billion.
Qualcomm's loss was $493 million, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $168 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",Boeing to report lower 737 deliveries amid supplier delays: executive,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Days before the numbers are due to be announced,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) warned that October aircraft deliveries to airlines would be lower than normal as the world's largest planemaker continues to be dogged by supplier delays on engines and other components. 
Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference in Chicago that deliveries would rebound in November and December despite persistent problems with engine-maker CFM International Inc, a venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Boeing is expected to release its orders and deliveries figures for October next week. Deliveries are a closely watched metric since that is the point when airlines pay the bulk of the money for a new jetliner.
""The deliveries for the balance of the year will be backloaded,"" Smith said. ""You'll see a lighter October than you would typically, and you'll see higher-than-production-rate delivery profile for November and December.""
Boeing is working through its recovery plan for its best-selling 737 single-aisle jetliner caused by delays on fuselages, engines and other components which created a production bottleneck at its Seattle-area plant over the summer.
Smith said the focus now is ""on GE and GE supply chain, getting them back on the recovery plan.""
""We're still not fully recovered and don't expect to until the end of the year,"" he added. 
His comments come after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive on Wednesday to address how to handle erroneous data from a sensor on the Boeing 737 MAX jet in the wake of last week's Indonesian jetliner crash.
Boeing said in a statement that it had alerted pilots to the issue. The FAA said it was mandating that airlines follow the Boeing bulletin.
Boeing has delivered 568 aircraft in the first nine months of 2018, as it works to overcome the 737 factory snarls, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago, putting it on track to deliver another record year of plane sales.

That keeps the manufacturer, which aims to deliver 810-815 planes in 2018, in front of its European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of cannabis companies rose on Wednesday as results from the previous day's U.S. elections pointed to more favorable political conditions for the cannabis industry.
 Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) shares jumped 30.6 percent. Shares of New Age Beverages Corp (O:NBEV), which has previously announced intentions to expand into cannabis products, climbed 20.1 percent. U.S. shares of Canadian companies  Canopy Growth  Corp (N:CGC) (TO:WEED),  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (N:ACB) (TO:ACB) and  Cronos  Group Inc (TO:CRON) (O:CRON) rose between 8 and 10 percent. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (P:MJ) posted a 7.1 percent gain.
Trading volume for the stocks was also brisk. Volume for shares of Tilray, whose volatility has served as a bellwether of investor sentiment toward the cannabis industry, was more than four times its 10-day moving average.
Cannabis shares initially rose upon the passage of ballot initiatives in several states approving marijuana use. Michigan became the 10th state to approve recreational use of marijuana, while Missouri and Utah passed measures to legalize medical use of the drug. A measure to approve recreational marijuana use in North Dakota failed, however. The drug remains illegal under U.S. federal law. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pc7Lpa)
""There's a number of major steps to go through for the industry to develop the potential that is there,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Wisconsin Capital Management in Madison, whose holdings include Canopy Growth. ""It's going to be in the best interest of government to basically get handles on this industry.""
The stocks added to their gains, with Tilray shares hitting a session high, after reports that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired. Sessions, an opponent of marijuana's legalization, had given prosecutors a greenlight to aggressively enforce federal laws against the drug in states where it had been decriminalized.
Despite the stocks' rally, Sessions' departure likely has little impact on the cannabis industry, said Jordan Waldrep, senior portfolio manager at USA Mutuals in Dallas, whose holdings include Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis and Cronos Group.
Nonetheless, Waldrep said, the passage of state initiatives and general voter sentiment indicate growing momentum for the cannabis industry.
""It's showing us the trend of voter opinion,"" he said. ""There's no putting the genie back in the bottle on this one.""
Sentiment is turning in marijuana's favor internationally. Mexico's next interior minister, Senator Olga Sanchez, told Reuters that a bill would be presented this week that would permit companies to grow and commercialize marijuana.
Two senators, Colorado Republican Cory Gardner and Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, have sponsored a bill that would leave determining the legal status of marijuana to states, thereby shielding cannabis companies from federal prosecution.
Also, two narrower bills regarding marijuana could be viable, especially as the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. The Safe Act would permit banks to provide services to cannabis companies in compliance with state law. The Veterans Equal Access Act would allow doctors in the Department of Veterans Affairs to authorize medical cannabis for patients in states where such use is legal.

""Broadly speaking, this election is less transformative for cannabis than the 2016 election by virtue of the fact that there were fewer ballots at the state level,"" said Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen. ""But the expectations are higher, federally speaking, as it relates to the makeup of Congress.""

213,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Statement Will Have Few Signs of Doves
The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting today and tomorrow and will be releasing its statement Thursday.
The market is convinced that the FOMC will keep rates in its range of 2% to 2.25% (92% chance according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool), just as it’s convinced they will hike in December (84% chance).
There will be no press conference and there’s little chance that the Federal Reserve will change the language in its statement, which suggested further rate hikes with the economy rising at a strong rate in September, to a more dovish stance, even given the October market selloff.
Watch for the statement to rather highlight a pickup in wages and a further drop in unemployment, indicative of an FOMC that’s willing to boost rates past neutral, Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said in a note.
“The Fed has done a 180 degree turn in its view on inflation,” Swonk said. “What was once a concern that the economy was not warm enough has shifted to worries of overheating. Even former Fed Chair Janet Yellen has adjusted to the new environment, arguing that the risks of overheating and seeing a corrosive rise in inflation are now greater than the threat that disinflation once was.”



2. Bond Yields on the Radar Again
If, as expected, the market gets its affirmation from the Fed that points to steady rate hikes, investors will be looking at bond yields.
Surging yields were a big scapegoat for the October tumble in equities, especially with high-flying companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) that are raising a large amount of capital.
The United States 2-year yield climbed today to around 2.96%, around levels not seen since 2008.
The United States 10-year yield was down today, but still up near 3.2%.
The midterms are in the rearview mirror, but politics aren’t. There is already talk of bipartisan cooperation on infrastructure spending, which could buoy stocks but would add more to the deficit, pushing yields even higher.
3. DR Horton Provides a Window to Housing
As a trifecta for economic wonks, earnings from DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) before the bell tomorrow will give more insight into the housing market, the one area of the economy that hasn’t been consistently humming along.
Analysts expect that the homebuilder earned $1.23 per share in the latest quarter on revenue of a little more than $4.5 billion.
The stock took a hit, as most did, in October, but has gained slightly since the end of that month.
Also on the calendar, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) will report numbers and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) weighs in with results."
214,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:56PM ET</span>","Keurig Dr Pepper Earnings beat, Revenue misses In Q3","Investing.com - Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) reported third quarter earnings  that beat analyst's expectations on Wednesday and revenue that fell short of forecasts.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>",U.S. political gridlock may create investment opportunity,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hope the split between Republicans and Democrats controlling the U.S. Congress will open up opportunities to pick new winners and losers because some government policies will be harder to predict. 
Correlations between stocks and sectors were high in the run-up to Tuesday's congressional elections, meaning investors have been either dumping or buying all kinds of unrelated stocks at once. Some funds have been damaged in what is a tough market to be a stock picker.
Now, with voters giving Democrats control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining their Senate majority, fund managers can take opposite sides of various policy bets.
These might include whether financials will benefit from deregulation even with stricter House oversight, if healthcare will face more policy proposals aimed at restraining costs, and whether military spending will get caught in a tussle between the two parties.
""If we are in a generally volatile environment but one that's not overly negative, in other words a choppy market as opposed to a bear market, I think that's an environment where correlations can fall,"" said Evan Brown, head of macro asset allocation strategy at UBS AG's asset management business.
""There's potential for sector out-performance and under-performance as a result of the election.""
President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was willing to work with Democrats on some policy priorities.
Issues that could gather bipartisan support include a package to improve infrastructure, protections against prescription drug price increases and a push to rebalance trade with China.
Stocks rallied on Wednesday, but one Cboe S&P 500 Implied Correlation Index (ICJ) was down more than 9 percent and another <.JCJ> was flat.
Correlations between stocks and sectors bottomed in September but spiked in October. Even more damaging: bonds and stocks moved in tandem, with both down for the month for only the 12th time since the March 2009 dawn of the U.S. bull market.
MACRO VS MICRO 
The October selloff was driven by macroeconomic concerns tied to the U.S. Federal Reserve, tariffs and inflation and hit active fund managers badly. U.S. large-cap active mutual fund managers posted their worst results versus their benchmark since September 2011, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) data.
More conflict in policy decisions could mean those factors drive stocks more than macroeconomic developments. 
For instance, investors are bidding up sand and gravel suppliers  Martin Marietta Materials Inc  (N:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Co (N:VMC) on the hope that bipartisan support for infrastructure spending can move forward. But ValueWorks LLC founder Charles Lemonides said he is trimming his stake in the stocks as they begin to reflect too much optimism.
""We think there is a lot of opportunity for people who are willing to do the hard work of investing, which is find individual investments that make sense,"" said Lemonides.
Macro forces might be less relevant than assumed in the short run. The meeting expected at the end of the month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could yield hopeful words but no firm commitments to resolve trade issues. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve could raise rates as expected in December while striking a tone that keeps markets calm. Both concerns - trade war and monetary policy tightening - may end up being left until 2019.
So long as markets focus on more parochial issues instead of trade and monetary policy the implications for stocks could be positive going into next year, investors said. 
Low correlations between stocks typically also mean lower volatility for the market overall. It was such a benign scenario that helped stocks weather the uncertainty of a new Trump administration in 2017.
Of course headlines on trade, monetary policy or an unexpected macro issue could upset the rosy outlook, keeping correlations high. Global earnings and economic growth could peak.
Policymakers, even those in the same party, could be so at odds that they make no policy changes. Republicans who have controlled the White House and Congress since January 2017 surprised investors by failing to replace the Affordable Care Act even though it was a campaign promise.
That makes oddsmaking hard now on a range of issues, from repealing a medical device tax to passing a budget or loosening regulations on banks. Each event could matter at the sector level, but are not likely to determine the course of the market overall. U.S. tariffs in place will start to bite companies and industries, adding new relevance to stock and sector picks.
And the aggressive monetary policy response to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis is wearing off, prompting differences between countries and allowing more defensive shares to gain in the United States, where they had once been eclipsed by technology names.
Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co Inc, said a market driven a broader range of stocks could help more people stay invested.

""Diversification has been a hard sell.""

217,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>","Wall Street rallies on U.S. elections; tech, health stocks lead","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose 2 percent on Wednesday, led by the technology and healthcare sectors as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the U.S. midterm elections and made bets that a divided Congress would be good news for equities.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, while President Donald Trump's Republican party expanded its Senate majority, pointing to the likelihood of political gridlock in Washington.
The S&P's biggest boosts came from the S&P technology sector and the healthcare stocks, with both indexes gaining 2.9 percent. The consumer discretionary sector climbed 3.1 percent, spurred by a 6.9 percent rise in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares. Amazon provided the single biggest boost to the S&P 500.
""Now we're in an environment that people can understand again so they'll be willing to put some money back on the table. There was a little fear out there,"" said Peter Tuz, president at Chase Investment Counsel Corp in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 545.29 points, or 2.13 percent, to 26,180.3, the S&P 500 gained 58.44 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,813.89, and the Nasdaq Composite added 194.79 points, or 2.64 percent, to 7,570.75.
The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, finished down 3.55 points at 16.36, its lowest close in about a month.
While a divided Congress will make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislation such as additional tax cuts, investors were not expecting a reversal of tax cuts and deregulation already enacted under Trump.
""This outcome probably provides the most paralysis for new policies,"" said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for Nuveen Asset Management in New York, adding that growth sectors such as tech and healthcare would continue to be strong. 
""In a scenario where there's no (additional) fiscal stimulus and we're not experiencing severe growth concerns in terms of contraction, they're the best bet,"" he said. 
Some strategists said Democratic control of the House means that Trump will have a harder time gaining support for efforts to impose new regulations on Amazon.com.
But even as technology and healthcare stocks soared, several investors questioned whether the sectors could now be at risk of additional regulatory scrutiny.
Even after Wednesday's gains, the S&P 500 was 4 percent below its record close in September, as investors kept their eyes on rising interest rates and the U.S.-China trade war.
The Federal Reserve began a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, but no rate increase was expected when it releases its policy decision on Thursday. The Fed is expected to raise rates in December, at its last policy meeting of the year.
Health insurers  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) jumped to record highs as voters in three states approved expanding Medicaid programs for low-income people.
DaVita Inc jumped 10.9 percent after California rejected a proposal to limit the rates that dialysis clinics can charge commercially insured patients.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) rose 5.7 percent and  Noble Energy  Inc (NYSE:NBL) gained 4 percent after Colorado voters rejected a tougher rule on oil and gas drilling, which spurred shares of companies operating in the state.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 71 new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges 8.0 billion shares changed hands compared with the 8.64 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

223,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Rallies 545 Points as Tech, Health Care Bask in Post-Midterm Glow","Investing.com – The Dow surged on Wednesday on the back of tech stocks after President Donald Trump vowed to work with Democrats after Republicans ceded control of the House in the wake of the midterm elections.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 545 points, or 2.13%. The S&P 500 rose 2.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.64%.
In a widely expected result, Democrats grabbed the extra seats needed to regain control of the House, raising the prospect of political gridlock, though Trump's somewhat conciliatory tone provided a modicum of hope that some key legislative measures could be pushed through Congress with bipartisan support.
""The Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for health care, a plan for whatever they're looking at and we'll negotiate,"" Trump said.
The rally on Wall Street post-midterm kept intact a trend stretching back decades, helped by a surge in tech and healthcare, with many saying that a split Congress was the best outcome for markets.
""We still think that the market will move higher into the year-end, and investors may have to participate on the upside,"" J.P. Morgan said.
Tech rose 3% as FANG stocks caught a bid, led by a surge in Netflix.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose 5% after revealing plans to increase the number of shows it produces in Europe in languages other than English in a bid to add further steel to its international subscriber base.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also traded higher.
Health care stocks also supported the broader market as traders bet that a divided Congress would struggle to push through major regulatory changes.
Energy, meanwhile, was also stronger, despite a fall in U.S. oil prices on the back of bearish inventory data showing crude supplies rose more than expected.
Investor attention was also swayed by upcoming monetary policy action as the Federal Reserve got its two-day meeting underway Wednesday, expected to result in an unchanged decision on interest rates Thursday.
In political news, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned at the request of Trump on Wednesday.
Sessions' chief of staff Matthew Whitaker will serve as acting attorney general, Trump said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michigan's vote Tuesday to become the 10th U.S. state where the recreational use of cannabis is legal is adding more momentum to a trend that some investors now say is inevitable: that marijuana will become legal nationwide within the next 5 years. 
As a result, companies, portfolio managers, and high-ranking executives are racing to position themselves to profit from what is expected to become a multi-billion dollar market. 
Executives at companies including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Molson Coors  Brewing Co (N:TAP), and  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) have jumped to roles at Canadian cannabis companies such as  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) and Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) over the last 18 months in order to gain experience in the industry.
At the same time companies ranging from  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) to Corona beer-maker Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) have taken the first steps into building cannabis-infused products. 
""We fully expect a successful regulated market to eventually develop around cannabis, and when it does, we expect it will disproportionately benefit the strongest innovators with well-branded products & robust supply chains,"" said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) who is bullish on the shares of Constellation Brands. 
Investors say that they are watching Canada, where the legal recreational use of marijuana went into effect in October, as a testing ground for retailers and companies before U.S. legalization. 
""The Canadian legalization has been a major catalyst for growth for a lot of companies in this space, and big consumer companies in the U.S. are paying attention,"" said Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager for the Federated Kaufmann line of funds.
""We're seeing consumer product companies test the waters and try to figure out how cannabis will factor into existing products or into new lines of products,"" she said, ranging from personal wellness products like CBD-infused lotion to consumable products like cannabis-infused beer. 
Recreational marijuana sales in Canada are expected to generate $4.3 billion in revenue in 2019, or slightly more than 60 percent of the country's total $7.1 billion marijuana market, which includes medical and illegal sales, consulting firm Deloitte noted.
In the U.S., cannabis remains illegal under federal law.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is widely expected to run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, introduced a bipartisan bill in August that would amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow cannabis companies in states where marijuana is legal to open accounts at federally regulated financial institutions and remain exempt from federal persecution. 
The Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group that represents more than 80 percent of all wines and spirits sold in the U.S., voiced support for legal cannabis in July. 
American executives who have joined the Canadian cannabis industry say that they were motivated in part by the expectation that marijuana will become federally legal in the U.S. within the next few years, a decision that helped them balance out the danger of reputational risk associated with a substance that has long been associated with the black market. 
""I had a negative perception of the industry initially and my first inclination was that cannabis companies were penny stocks and not that credible,"" said Mark Castaneda, the chief financial officer at Tilray. It was only after a headhunter sold him on the industry that Castaneda felt comfortable enough to make the switch. 
""I started to see that this was a lifetime chance because this is a massive shift where you know there are consumers who use this product and now that it was legal the market could be even larger,"" he said, adding that he expects that Canadian cannabis companies such as his own will eventually expand into the U.S. once marijuana becomes legal. 
The potential growth of the cannabis industry in the U.S. is evident in the work histories of new hires by Canadian cannabis companies that have their sights set on expansion, said David King, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments who has invested in convertible bonds issued by Canopy Growth Corp.

""You go to roadshows to some of these cannabis companies and their new executives are coming from impressive places,"" he said. ""You have real adults running the company.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors fled bonds at the fastest pace since 2013 in the final week of October, worried about rising interest rates and tightening monetary policy, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday.
More than $18.5 billion of mutual fund and exchange-traded fund assets flowed out the debt market during the week ended Oct. 31, the most since the ""Taper Tantrum"" panic of June 2013, when markets worried about the U.S. Federal Reserve planning to stop buying bonds.
Fed policy has again helped drive investors to reconsider their bond holdings after pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into debt products since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The latest withdrawals marked a fourth straight week of outflows, according to the trade group.
U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers seem on course to deliver their fourth rate hike of the year in December - the most in any calendar year since 2006 - while letting the Fed's large holdings of bonds accumulated during the financial crisis roll off.
""When rates rise from a very low level, bond yields and stocks can go up at the same time,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's funds business.
Investors added the most cash in six weeks - $5.6 billion - to stock funds during the same week as strong quarterly earnings reports rolled in, ICI said. Year-over-year profit growth for the S&P 500 is at 27.7 percent, with most companies beating Wall Street forecasts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Under the deal, which includes car-sharing units Car2Go and DriveNow as well as ride-hailing, parking and charging services, Daimler and BMW will each hold 50 percent stakes in a joint venture.
They have offered concessions to address EU antitrust concerns over the deal they hope would let them better compete with U.S. rival Uber and China's Didi Chuxing.
The European Commission has found the deal would raise competition concerns for free-floating car sharing services in Berlin, Cologne, Duesseldorf, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna. It said Daimler and BMW agreed to a remedy package in the six cities.
""The commitments thus fully address the Commission's concerns as they will reduce the barriers to entry for competing free-floating car sharing providers,"" the Commission said in a statement.

""Therefore the Commission concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns. The Commission's decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Citibank (N:C) will pay more than $38 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for abuse in handling American Depositary Receipts (ADRS), the regulator said in a statement on Wednesday.
The SEC found that Citibank falsely provided U.S. securities that represent foreign shares, or ADRs, to brokers in thousands of premature transactions. Those brokers and customers did not have the actual number of foreign shares to support those ADRs, the SEC statement said.
The bank did not admit or deny the SEC's findings on its practices, but agreed to pay the fine and additional fees related to the abuses.

(Reuters) - Shares in drugmakers and U.S. health insurers rallied on Wednesday, after election results delivered a split Congress that is unlikely to significantly cut government healthcare programs or reduce drug prices in the world's biggest and most profitable market.
Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats in Tuesday's elections, a setback for President Donald Trump, but increased their grip on the Senate, signaling likely policy gridlock in Washington.
While both parties agree on the need to bring down healthcare costs, they are deeply divided on how to go about it.
Analysts said a split Congress could benefit healthcare stocks, calling it a ""best case scenario."" 
""We expect to see legislative deadlock for the next two years, with an uptick in House hearings and political posturing while President Trump continues to push his agenda through executive action and the judiciary,"" Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said.
 Humana Inc  (N:HUM) shares hit an all-time high of $354.33, while fellow health insurers UnitedHealth (N:UNH) and Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) also touched records. 
Another attempt to repeal or replace former President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act (ACA) could now be off the table, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Zack Sopcak.
Shares of Molina Healthcare (N:MOH) and  Centene  Corp (N:CNC), which have significant Obamacare business, were up more than 8 percent. 
Voters in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska approved expansion of Medicaid programs for low-income people, helping shares of Medicaid-focused insurers like WellCare Health Plans (N:WCG). 
Collectively, the three states could add 150,000 to 200,000 new Medicaid-covered lives, said BMO analyst Matthew Borsch.
The U.S. healthcare sector (SPXHC) was leading the rally on Wall Street, up 2.8 percent in midday trading.
Wall Street analysts had cautioned that a Democrat sweep of both the House and Senate could have sparked a sell-off in pharma, biotech and drug supply chain stocks, while full Republican control could have hurt health insurers that rely on Obamacare business.
Shares of German-based dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) and U.S. rival  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA) rose as California rejected a proposal that would have limited rates dialysis clinics can charge commercially insured patients.
Shares of U.S. drugmakers  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and AbbVie (N:ABBV) were up more than 3 percent, while Merck & Co (N:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) SASY), Roche (S:ROG), AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) also rose.
Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York, said Republicans' solidifying their hold on the Senate makes legislation to lower drug pricing less likely.

""I don't see it getting through a Republican Senate,"" she said.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares bounced on Wednesday in a broad rally after U.S. midterm elections delivered no big surprise, with a string of solid earnings updates and a rally in Spanish banks on a favorable tax ruling also providing relief.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark closed with a 1 percent gain near a three-day high hit earlier in the session, with all major country and sectoral indexes gaining between 0.5 percent and 2 percent on the day.
Spain's stock market (IBEX) closed at its highest since Oct. 10, boosted mainly by its banking sector.
The U.S. midterm elections saw Democrats ride a wave of dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, giving them the opportunity to block Trump's agenda and open his administration to intense scrutiny.
A divided Congress could be neutral for equities overall, some dealers said, but the result spurred investors to return to riskier assets, such as equities.
""With the Democrats taking over the House we will now have to see what gridlock in Congress means for policy. As for the market impact, a split Congress has historically been bullish for equities and we expect to see the same pattern again,"" said Torsten Slok, Chief International Economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""It is too early to predict where policy will go ... What matters for markets is what will happen to trade policy, healthcare policy, immigration policy and fiscal policy.""

BANK GAINS
Spanish banks were in the spotlight after a government move to counteract a court ruling that would have forced customers to pay mortgage stamp duty, pledging to pass a law to oblige banks to pay the tax.
Banking shares, which had rallied initially on the court ruling, came off early highs after the government's announcement but largely held gains after it became clear that the new law would not be applied retrospectively.
Shares in Caixabank (MC:CABK) Sabadell (MC:SABE), BBVA (MC:BBVA), Santander (MC:SAN) and  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) were up by between 1.8 percent and 4.1 percent.
""The Supreme Court decision to maintain the status quo on the mortgage tax has removed a tail risk and restored the much-needed legal security for the banks to continue operating in the long-duration business of mortgage loans,"" broker Alantra said in a note.
Topping the leader board were shares in dialysis care services provider Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG), which rose 9.6 percent after a vote in California defeated a proposal to cap profits of dialysis clinics.
Healthcare stocks (SXDP) rose 1.5 percent because the results of the U.S. midterms were seen as reducing the likelihood of legislative action to cut medical costs in the world's biggest and most profitable market. 

 Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) jumped 6.7 percent for its biggest daily gain since August 2013 after the lender's largest shareholder ousted the chairman, the latest executive to be forced out after a money laundering scandal.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>","Ryanair, CEO are sued in U.S. over stock price, labor relations","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (O:RYAAY) and longtime Chief Executive Michael O'Leary have been sued in New York by a shareholder that said Europe's largest airline defrauded investors and inflated its share price by overstating its ability to manage labor relations and keep costs down.
The complaint was filed on Tuesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan by an Alabama pension fund, seeking class-action status and damages for investors in Ryanair's American depositary shares from May 30, 2017 to Sept. 28, 2018.
In a statement on Wednesday, Dublin-based Ryanair said it will defend itself against the claims, which it called ""false"" and ""doomed to fail.""
According to the complaint, Ryanair misled investors in regulatory filings and conference calls about its labor stability, including ""industry leading"" contracts with pilots and cabin crews, and its positive impact on operations.
The truth came out as labor unrest forced Ryanair last December to recognize unions for the first time, and led this summer to costly strikes that stranded thousands of passengers in several countries, the complaint said.
""Unbeknownst to investors, the company's historical profit growth was built on an undisclosed and unsustainable foundation of worker exploitation and employee turnover,"" the complaint said. ""The decline in the price of Ryanair ADSs was the direct result of the nature and extent of defendants' fraud finally being revealed to investors and the market.""
Ryanair cited labor issues when it cut its full-year profit forecast on Oct. 1. Its share price closed that day more than one-third below its level in mid-March.
In Wednesday's statement, Ryanair said it has experienced ""very little"" labor disruption from employees, and that most flight disruptions resulted from air traffic control strikes and staff shortages, a problem common to European Union airlines.
O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive since 1994, said last month he hoped to reach labor agreements with all of the carrier's major unions before Christmas.
ADSs on June 30 accounted for 43.7 percent of Ryanair's issued ordinary shares, assuming all were converted into ordinary shares, the company has said. Ryanair's market value is roughly $16 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The lawsuit was filed by the City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System. Its law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd specializes in securities fraud.
It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States after what they consider unexpected share price declines.

The case is City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System v Ryanair Holdings Plc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-10330.

The fashion group said it generated $1.25 billion sales, missing the $1.26 billion that was expected by analysts, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, its same-store sales decreased 2.1%, mostly due to a decline in the European market.
Its bottom line came at $1.27 adjusted earnings per share, beating the $1.10 that was expected by Wall Street.
“We are pleased to report results that have again exceeded our expectations,"" said  CEO John Idol in a press release.
""As we enter the second half of fiscal 2019 we look forward to welcoming Versace into our group. With the acquisition of Versace we have built one of the world's leading fashion luxury groups in just one year, setting the stage for accelerated revenue and earnings growth. This is a truly remarkable and historic moment for our company and we look forward to completing this transformational acquisition in the coming months.""
Looking ahead, the global fashion brand boosted its earnings guidance to a range between $4.95 and $5.05, up $0.05 from its previous forecast. But, the company said its comparable store sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits, primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency impact.
In September, Michael Kors has agreed to buy the Italian fashion house Versace for 1.83 billion euros ($2.12 billion), and said it will change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal closes. At the time. the company said it expects the  acquisition of Versace to be ""dilutive to earnings per share in the high-single digits in fiscal 2020, accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2021, and accretive in the high-single digits in fiscal 2022.""
Shares were down 21% this year through Tuesday.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",China won't sell jetliners to Iran: state aero executive,"By Stella Qiu and Brenda Goh
ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - A Chinese state firm on Wednesday ruled out selling passenger planes to Iran to help the Islamic Republic revive fleet renewal plans, while a Russian executive suggested Moscow would be wary of putting its own programs at risk of U.S. retaliation.
The comments in separate interviews at China's largest air show underscore the challenges Iran faces in rekindling plans to import planes after the U.S. reimposed sanctions, though IranAir reiterated on Wednesday it would welcome offers from suppliers not subject to restrictions on the export of U.S. plane parts.
Deals to buy 200 aircraft from Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and European turboprop maker ATR have virtually all stalled after the United States withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on firms including IranAir.
Iran's search for other suppliers was a talking point on the sidelines of Airshow China this week, where China promoted its growing aircraft industry as it looks to break into foreign markets for planes such as its long-delayed ARJ21 regional jet.
But asked whether Iran had shown interest in buying Chinese airplanes, Zhao Yuerang, general manager of manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), told Reuters: ""No, we cannot sell to Iran. Iran is off the table.""
Pressed on China's ability to sell the ARJ21 to Iran, he added: ""We need to abide by regulations of both countries.""
In May, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) revoked licenses to sell passenger jets to Iran that are required for any plane with more than 10 percent U.S. parts, regardless of where it is made.
IranAir has said it is looking to buy planes from any company not requiring the U.S. permits and may consider Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100. 
Asked at Airshow China in Zhuhai whether Moscow was in talks to sell the Superjet to IranAir, a senior official with state holding company Rostec declined to comment in detail.
""This is a sensitive issue,"" Viktor Kladov, Rostec's director for international cooperation and regional policy, told Reuters.
""You understand why, because we cannot endanger the whole Superjet program,"" he added.
Besides controlling exports for aircraft containing over 10 percent U.S. parts, analysts say the United States sets the tone for global aviation through its benchmark system of safety regulation and the widespread use of the dollar in plane deals.
Kladov said Russia's industry would continue to follow international standards on regulation and aircraft safety, but would strive to be independent commercially. 

Rostec is already doing some deals in Russian and other currencies, he added.

Voters in Michigan and North Dakota are considering the full recreational use of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21. Meanwhile, citizens in Missouri and Utah are voting for medical use of marijuana.
As a result, weed stocks were rising across the board. Here's the scoreboard at 10:32 a.m. ET:
High-flying cannabis stocks have caught the attention of both Main Street and Wall Street this year. In October, Canada became the second country after Uruguay to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.
At the time, Jon Trauben, managing partner at the cannabis-focused Altitude Investment Management,  said, ""We believe that the legalization in Canada offers a road map to invest in the companies that will form the basis of the legal cannabis industry in the coming years."" 
In the two months before Canada's recreational legalization, the biggest cannabis stocks all more than doubled in value. But after the legalization, they've been hard hit.
While marijuana is not allowed at the federal level in the US, some states have already opened the door for the market. So far in the US, nine states and Washington, DC allow recreational marijuana, and 32 states allow medical marijuana.

Investor confidence was boosted after the midterm elections, as a gridlock in Congress has been known to bring strong returns in equity markets.
The results were in line with forecasts and seen as a referendum on U.S. President Donald Trump’s term.
Despite the split, Trump tweeted that the elections were a “tremendous success.” He is expected to make a statement on the midterm results at 11:30 AM ET (16:30 GMT).

Bonds, currencies and stocks rose as speculation the midterm election result will produce policy gridlock in Washington weakened the dollar and took the edge off U.S. Treasury yields.
But with one source of uncertainty out of the way, focus is now shifting to what it means for Trump’s tax cuts and U.S.-China trade relations, and how quickly the Federal Reserve will press ahead with the removal of stimulus.
“Investors are going to be relieved to have mid-term election news out of the headlines,” said Hannah Anderson, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Hong Kong. Still, “nothing’s going to change on the trade front. Fears and sentiment about trade are going to continue to be reflected across the EM complex, at least for the next couple of months,” she said.
There were enough domestic reasons for some of the biggest gains. The Indonesian rupiah had its fifth advance in six days as data showed the country’s foreign reserves rose in October for the first time this year. Brazil’s Ibovespa stock index jumped with the real as President-elect Jair Bolsonaro indicated he will preserve the central bank’s independence and data showed an unexpected easing of inflation. South Africa’s rand climbed to its strongest level in three months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday it was investigating whether General Motors Co (N:GM), should recall an additional 1.7 million sport utility vehicles due to an issue with windshield wiper failures.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, had recalled 367,800 2013 GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Equinox SUVs in the United States in August 2016 to address the problem. 
But after receiving 249 complaints since then about similar problems in vehicles from five other model years, the federal agency said it was looking into whether the recall should be expanded to include a further 1.7 million vehicles from the 2010-2016 model years in the United States.
No crashes or injuries relating to the issue have been reported, GM said.
The automaker said it was cooperating with the NHTSA review. 
The 2013 GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Equinox SUVs were recalled ""because warranty data showed a higher-than-expected failure rate,"" and the company has continued to monitor field data on other model years of those vehicles, GM said. 
""We will work with NHTSA on an updated review of the data for the vehicles covered by the query,"" GM added.
The recalls came after a GM Canada brand quality manager reported a potential safety issue relating to windshield wiper failures in Canada through GM's ""Speak Up For Safety,"" program in late 2015, the automaker said.
GM said data showed significantly higher field incidents in parts of Canada with heavy road salt use, which prompted a June 2016 recall of 141,407 2010-2017 GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Equinox SUVs in Canada. Over the following two months, a higher number of U.S. reports prompted a U.S. recall of the 2013 model vehicles, the company said.
In March, GM expanded its recall in Canada to another 15,600 vehicles from the 2010-2017 model years, Transport Canada said. 

In the 2016 recalls, GM said the front-wiper module would be replaced with a module that has a water deflector and, if needed, dealers would fill the water management hole and drill a new small hole in a different location.

Murdoch agreed in June to sell Fox's entertainment assets to Walt Disney (N:DIS) for $71.3 billion and is nearing completion of the deal after receiving approval from the European Commission this week, subject to the sale by Disney of its interests in some news and documentary channels.
Revenue at Fox's filmed entertainment division fell 7.5 percent to $1.82 billion, missing analysts' estimate of $1.95 billion. 
Shares in the company were up less than 1 percent in premarket trade. 
Revenue from Fox's cable division rose 3.6 percent to $4.35 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the quarter and compared to analysts' average estimate of $4.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Overall revenue rose to $7.18 billion from $7.00 billion, shy of a consensus estimate of $7.23 billion.
After the Disney sale is completed Fox will carve out a new company, including Fox News, Business, Sports and the Broadcasting Company which it expects to have annual revenue of around $10 billion. 
The Los Angeles-based studio and media company said net income attributable to shareholders increased to $1.29 billion or 69 cents per share in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, from $855 million or 46 cents per share a year earlier.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 07:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Credit Suisse pulls out of South Africa in global shift - sources,"By Tiisetso Motsoeneng
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) has pulled out of South Africa after more than a decade as part of chief executive Tidjane Thiam's bank-wide revamp, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Switzerland's second largest bank is in the final stages of a three-year drive to focus on managing the money of wealthy investors and scale back investment banking.
""They are gone. It's a total withdrawal wrapped up some weeks back,"" one of the sources said. 
In 2013 Credit Suisse, which declined to comment, told customers in nearly 50 markets, including Congo and Angola, that it would end cross-border wealth management business with them.
Credit Suisse's website says it has offices in approximately 50 countries and lists Johannesburg as its only sub-Saharan African location.
Thiam, who in September ruled himself out as a candidate for political office in his native Ivory Coast, has been the driving force behind the changes at the Swiss bank. Like other European players, Credit Suisse has been struggling to compete with the U.S. investment banks which dominate Wall Street.
Credit Suisse, which had around 30 staff at its Johannesburg office, re-entered South Africa in 2006 after leaving in the 1980s under pressure from anti-apartheid campaigners. 
QUIET WITHDRAWAL
The Swiss bank's quiet withdrawal comes months after its rival  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it would wind up its advisory, corporate broking and sponsor-services to refocus on Europe and its home market after three years of losses.
Credit Suisse is quitting a country whose economy has slipped into a recession for the first time since 2009, and where activity in mergers and acquisitions halved in the first six months of the year to its lowest level in a decade. 
Unlike Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank plans to maintain a physical presence offering debt capital markets, fixed income and treasury services.
""We announced earlier this year that we were reviewing our operations in Johannesburg, and subsequently took the decision to close the office,"" Credit Suisse spokesman James Quinn said in an email. 
""South Africa remains a focus for Credit Suisse, and we continue to serve clients across our wealth management and investment banking franchises."" 
Credit Suisse will offer private banking services for well-heeled South Africans from London, Zurich and Dubai, another source said. Its research teams in these cities would continue to cover selected blue chip South African companies, they added.
The Swiss bank initially teamed up with Standard Bank (J:SBKJ), South Africa's biggest lender by assets, to create a joint venture focusing on equity research, sales, trading and equity capital markets deals. 

But it ended this four years later, saying it would develop its offering of trading, private trading and investment bank.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Albemarle's claim to unique lithium technology draws scrutiny,"By Ernest Scheyder and Dave Sherwood 
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif./SANTIAGO (Reuters) -  Albemarle  Corp's (N:ALB) claim to have developed a unique process that would more than triple its lithium production from Chile's Atacama desert without using more water is drawing increased scrutiny from regulators and investors pushing for more details. 
The development could help Albemarle cement its position as the world's largest lithium company, just as global demand for the light metal is spiking for use in batteries that power electric vehicles and consumer goods.
But if the extraction process proves less than advertised, the U.S.-based company risks ceding its crown as the world's biggest lithium producer to smaller rivals including Chile's own SQM (SN:SQMa). 
The lack of clarity over the issue prompted Chile's nuclear commission, which oversees the sale and export of lithium in Chile, to deny Albemarle's request to increase its production quota for the white metal. The agency says the company has yet to explain how its technology will allow it to extract more lithium from the same amount of brine in the world's driest desert. 
Albemarle has been reluctant to provide specific details of the new process first announced in September 2017. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) began asking last March for specifics on the process.
Albemarle says it ""is preparing a revised request addressing CCHEN's concerns, which are of a technical nature"" and that it expects to ultimately receive approval to produce more lithium. 
Asked by Reuters in late October for more concrete details on the new technology, Eric Norris, head of Albemarle's lithium division, said the new process was ""very efficient and it's obviously very sustainable"" but gave few other specific details.
""It's likely some process or technology where you don't lose lithium to the salts that evaporate out of the ponds,"" said Robert Baylis, a lithium analyst with Roskill.
Norris said Albemarle would spend ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" to build a plant in the Atacama that would further refine brine concentrate to increase the amount of lithium recovered to 80 percent, up from ""about half"" today. Some industry analysts say the current lithium recovery figure is lower, around 30 percent. 
Norris also said the company was spending $1 billion in Chile, its largest area of operations, and hiring more than 1,700 people. But he offered no timeline for the spending and hiring.
""I don't know if they're doing anything proprietary or revolutionary,"" said David Deak, an independent battery industry consultant and former lithium buyer for electric carmarker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). ""It's unclear really what Albemarle has here, and what it means in terms of water usage.""
That usage is closely watched by Chilean regulators, despite the $100 million in royalties the country collects annually from Albemarle, due to concerns about water and brine levels in the Atacama. 
MODIFICATION
Albemarle entered Chile as part of its 2015 buyout of smaller rival Rockwood Holdings, inheriting access to massive lithium reserves. 
The company's lithium process, which relies heavily on evaporation ponds, was designed to extract potash fertilizer from salts, with lithium only as a byproduct.
Tweaking that technology to boost lithium recovery has long been an obsession of Albemarle and SQM. Indeed, rivals in Argentina, including  Livent Corp  (N:LTHM), have developed methods that allow for nearly all lithium in brine to be recovered, a step made possible in part by the different chemical composition of Argentine brine.
Norris said that Albemarle's process is not the same as Livent's, without elaborating. Livent, for its part, believes there may be some crossover.
In Chile, Albemarle has repeatedly assured regulators that it is now capable of sharply increasing the amount of lithium it can extract from brine, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a Chilean freedom of information request. 
""The modification is made possible because Albemarle has developed a sustainable technology that allows us to increase the efficiency of our processes in the Salar de Atacama without using more brine or water, and as a consequence, produce more tons of lithium carbonate,"" Stephen Elgueta, Albemarle's Chilean manager, wrote to nuclear agency CCHEN on March 23.
On May 3, CCHEN asked Albemarle to provide ""details with respect to the technology that would enable the increase.""
The following month, three executives from Albemarle met with CCHEN director Patricio Aguilera at Santiago's La Reina Center for Nuclear Studies.
According to Chile's lobbyist transparency website, Albemarle presented its production projections through 2044 during the hour-long June meeting, as well as ""some process improvements it is implementing.""  
But officials from CCHEN remained unconvinced.
""The details provided ... during the meeting are insufficient,"" wrote Aguilera on June 20, adding that the efficiency improvements touted by Albemarle in the meeting only ""justified a percentage of the total [increase in quota]"" requested by the company.
Albemarle provided no more information to CCHEN during the nearly three months that followed, according to Chilean regulatory filings.
On Sept. 12, CCHEN formally rejected Albemarle's March request to increase its quota to sell lithium outside the country. The agency said in a resolution that the miner had failed to answer questions about how the ""technology would permit the increase in efficiency.""

""There's questions across industry about what exactly Albemarle has actually developed,"" said Chris Berry, an independent lithium analyst based in New York.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German state prosecutors confirmed they searched the Munich offices of investor BlackRock as part of a probe into an illicit tax trading scheme but exonerated the company's local chairman, who is vying to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The prosecutors are investigating a fraud known as cum-ex that typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
On Tuesday, they searched the Munich offices of BlackRock, prompting the globe's biggest investor to say that it was fully cooperating with the probe of cum-ex transactions between 2007-2011.
The search has prompted wide national interest in Germany because Friedrich Merz, a potential successor to Merkel, has held the post of BlackRock's chairman in Germany since 2016.
Merz, who was not there at the time of the trades that are being investigated, said he had ordered the fund's management board to investigate all incidents involving such cum-ex deals.
""Everything will be investigated and we will actively participate in that,"" he said at a political event in the northwestern German city of Duesseldorf on Tuesday.
Confirming the search, Cologne prosecutors said on Wednesday that Merz was not suspected of wrongdoing. 
Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor, possibly as soon as next year.

Gerhard Schick, a Greens party member of Germany's parliament, said the case raised the question as to whether Merz had responded promptly enough.

Shares of the company fell 11.3 percent to $50.97 in premarket trading on Wednesday following the news.
Revenue from Kors' European retail stores fell nearly 10 percent during the quarter ended September, leading to total retail revenue of $643.9 million.
The result missed analysts' average estimate of $661.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Kors has been reducing inventory at its European stores to create exclusivity for its products in a region where wealthy fashion consumers have long preferred local luxury brands from LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP).
In order to better compete with peers in Europe, Kors is spending over $2 billion to buy Italian luxury designer Versace.
Kors said quarterly net income attributable to the company fell to $137.6 million from $202.9 million a year earlier.
Total revenue rose 9.3 percent to $1.25 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $1.26 billion. The miss was the first since the quarter ended December 2016.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.27 per share, above analysts' estimates of $1.10 per share.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 06:11AM ET</span>",U.S. companies team up with hospitals to reduce employee maternity costs,"By Jilian Mincer
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and other large companies are trying to chip away at rising childbirth costs for U.S. employees, working directly with hospitals to reduce cesarean sections and related complications.
The efforts are in very early stages, with few details on their impact outside of cost savings of a few million dollars so far. But they illustrate yet another path companies are taking to bring down U.S. medical costs by working with doctors and hospitals to set health goals.
GE's maternity strategy is designed to steer its employees to hospitals that are believed to provide better care and less likely to recommend unnecessary and costly interventions, company officials told Reuters.
U.S. employer spending on maternity care rose 50 percent in the last decade, fueled by a jump in C-section rates despite years of efforts to curb the practice, according to research firm Truven Health Analytics. For a graphic, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2P1MPRs
""Maternity is one of the main drivers of high cost claims,"" for employers, said Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health. Avoiding unnecessary C-sections and minimizing complications ""decreases turnover in the workforce following the birth of a child,"" she said. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) said it has included maternity goals, including reducing C-sections, in a new contract with a Detroit-area hospital.  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) demanded explanations from hospitals that care for its employees when its C-section rate hit 44 percent several years ago. Now part of the merged company DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP), it is working on new payment agreements with doctors and administrators.
""We went to them and said how do you explain this?"" said Steve Morgenstern, Dow Chemical's North American Health and Insurance Plan Leader, who called the rate ""unacceptable.""        
""BUNDLED"" PAYMENTS TO CUT COSTS  
GE launched its Maternity Care Select Program in Cincinnati, Ohio, home to its aviation business, where nearly 300 babies are born to employee families every year. 
Local hospital system TriHealth agreed to a single ""bundled"" payment rate to care for low and moderate-risk mothers from the start of pregnancy until 90 days after the baby is born, rather than charge for each visit and delivery separately. That typically removes the financial upside for C-sections, which cost nearly 60 percent more, on average, than a regular delivery. 
Adam Malinoski, GE's manager of health services, said none of the company's health insurers offered bundled payments on maternity care when it designed its program, so it decided to work directly with providers. 
GE pays the out-of-pocket costs for women who enroll, saving them up to several thousand dollars. TriHealth and GE would not disclose the bundled payment rates or how they compare with other hospital rates.
New deliveries under GE's program began in 2016, when only 78 pregnant women enrolled. In 2017, 136 women enrolled, TriHealth told Reuters. C-section rates for first-time, low-risk deliveries, which represent a small group within the program, dropped to about 6 percent in 2017 from 24 percent in 2016. That comes in well below the U.S. rate of 26 percent for low-risk births. 
TriHealth would not disclose the C-section rate for the total group. 
GE expanded the program to hospitals in Wisconsin, South Carolina and Massachusetts in 2017 and announced a fifth location in New York in August, but says it is too early to provide data for other locations. 
GE executives said the program so far has saved the company nearly $2 million because of lower negotiated fees for maternity care. It represents a fraction of its spending on the 113,000 employees and family members enrolled in the GE health insurance plan, but a step in the right direction, they added. 
""WE WERE SHOCKED""
The rise of C-sections has been fueled in part by fears about malpractice litigation, as well as expecting mothers with health issues or who are older, which raise the risk of complications.
Hospitals say that makes them reluctant to set maternity goals. The Stanford Health Care medical system works directly with employers on health targets, such as diabetes care, but has so far refused to set specific goals on C-sections.     
In such higher risk cases, ""it's entirely appropriate and (there's) no way to determine upfront"" who will need a cesarean, said John Jackson, who handles corporate health partnerships at Stanford Health Care.
Suzanne Delbanco, executive director of the nonprofit Catalyst for Payment Reform, has worked with large employers seeking to reduce C-section rates. But some companies ""are still leery about wading in too much,"" she said. ""They don't want to alienate people, they don't want to be accused of being Big Brother.""
GM is taking its own shot at lowering costs and improving care with a new health program, announced in August, that was created directly with Henry Ford Health System in Michigan . Three of the program's 19 health metrics involve maternity care such as lowering C-section rates, the company told Reuters.       
The automaker's total C-section rates vary widely, from about 40 percent in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to 30 percent or lower in Detroit.             

""We were shocked,"" said Sheila Savageau, U.S. health care leader for GM. ""We have to change the system.""

Russia's United Aircraft Corporation and the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd kickstarted full-scale development of the CR929 widebody jet program last year, to build an aircraft that can muscle into a lucrative market now dominated by Boeing Co's (N:BA) 787 and Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) A350 jets.
""We are now choosing one of two suppliers, General Electric's GEnX and Rolls Royce's Trent 7000,"" Maxim Litvinov, one of the two chief designers, told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that the venture planned to make a decision by the first half of next year.
""But right now Russia's United Engine Corporation and the Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) are also cooperating on creating a new engine,"" he said, on the sidelines of Airshow China, where it unveiled a life-size model of the CR929's cabin. 
Priority when choosing suppliers will be given to Russian and Chinese firms, and then to Western firms with Russian or Chinese partners' joint ventures, he said, adding that the basic principle should be that the firms offer competitive proposals. 
In addition, current trade tensions between China and the United States, and U.S. sanctions against Russia, could be factored into the selection process, Litvinov said.
""Of course, this is a great risk, and that makes us take that into consideration and we do that,"" he said.
""But in spite of all this, the potential suppliers are looking for some solutions how to avoid the situation and find any way to cooperate with us in our interests and in their own interests.""
He expected to receive the Sino-Russian engine by the end of the next decade and the venture would like the engine to have a thrust range of 35 tonnes, he added.
The venture, China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corp (CRAIC), said in May it had received proposals from seven foreign and local companies to supply the jet's engine.
Litvinov said the joint venture had so far agreed on technical requirements and aspects such as after-sales support, with a total of 50 requests for proposal packages to be issued to prospective suppliers. 

""All these packages will be delivered by the end of this year,"" he said, adding that the joint venture intends for the plane to take its first flight between 2023 and 2025.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (DE:ADSGn) cut its 2018 revenue forecast on Wednesday after third quarter sales fell in western Europe, where it was hit by changing fashions and Nike's (N:NKE) gains in soccer.
While the German sportswear firm has been taking market share in North America, its U.S. rival has been powering ahead in Europe, helped by a strong showing by Nike-sponsored teams at the soccer World Cup and its Phantom range launch.
Adidas shares, which have gained 12 percent in the last year, were down 2.3 percent by 0954 GMT after it cut its 2018 target for currency-neutral sales growth to between 8 to 9 percent from ""around 10 percent"".
Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted has focused on improving profitability at Adidas since he took over in 2016, by focusing on growing in North America and Asia and pushing ecommerce, where margins are higher than in stores.
Adidas said it now expects 2018 net income from continuing operations to grow 16 to 20 percent, compared with previous guidance of 13 to 17 percent.
After an earlier warning that western European sale were likely to be flat in the second half, Adidas said the region's currency-adjusted sales fell 1 percent in the third quarter.
Rorsted said Adidas had relied too much on shoes like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar that have fallen out of fashion, and not enough on sports performance gear.
""We are a sports company. We should have done a better job in the sports channel,"" he told journalists.
NOT FAST ENOUGH 
Adidas had also failed to react quickly enough to demand for its new styles like Continental shoes, and had overpriced some goods, all factors it is now addressing, Rorsted added.
Adidas continued to grow fast elsewhere, with sales up 16 percent in North America and by 15 percent in Asia-Pacific.
Ecommerce sales jumped 76 percent in the quarter and Adidas saw the September launch of Yeezy Boost shoes designed by rapper Kanye West drive traffic to its website, with sales and margins of the new styles above its expectations.
Overall, Adidas said its third-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 8 percent to 5.873 billion euros ($6.75 billion), shy of analysts' average forecasts, while net profit from continuing operations jumped 19 percent to 656 million euros, beating consensus.
German rival Puma (DE:PUMG) raised its outlook for full-year sales and operating profit last month as it reported strong sales growth in the Americas and Asia and said its first basketball shoe in 20 years had been well received.

EINDHOVEN, Netherlands/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Grocery group Ahold Delhaize will roll out small, automated warehouses to speed order picking and cut delivery times, Reuters has learned, as it revamps its ecommerce business in response to rising competition in a fast-growing sector.
At an investor event on Nov. 13, the world's eighth biggest food retailer is set to showcase a partnership that will allow it to automate order collection at mini ""robot supermarkets"" attached to the stores of its U.S. chains like Stop & Shop.
That marks a departure from its previous strategy of relying more on manual labor at bigger warehouses, or on a mixture of man and machine, to meet online food orders.
Now Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize is teaming up with Takeoff, a start-up which builds small warehouses that stack groceries to the ceiling to save space and use robot arms to assemble shoppers' orders for items such as beer, milk, bread and fruit.
The warehouses serve as condensed supermarkets that can supply several stores with click-and-collect orders. They cost about $3 million to build, which Takeoff says is less than the cost of a typical store revamp.
""Ahold is preparing for a major push,"" Curt Avallone, Takeoff's chief development officer who led digital innovation at Stop & Shop until 2003, told Reuters.
""If it goes well, both from their side and our side, the hope is we would rapidly be able to build quite a few.""
Ahold Chief Executive Frans Muller confirmed the deal on Wednesday and said it should help expand online faster and at a lower cost than with standalone warehouses.
""With the robotized solution we can optimize those picking costs and be closer with micro fulfillment to our catchment areas. We also reduce the cost of the last mile,"" he said.
Ahold's shares jumped 5 percent on Wednesday as it reported third-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts, lifted by strong online sales and growth in its key markets.
GRAPHIC: Online grocery set to grow fast - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Cz1wVK
ONLINE GROCERY WAR
Ahold's move is the latest salvo in a war for the online grocery market that has escalated since Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods last year. Whole Foods since launched same-day grocery delivery with Amazon's Prime Now in more than 60 cities. Other retailers are also racing to respond: Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will test Alert Innovation’s Alphabot automated grocery picking at a store in New Hampshire, and Kroger (NYSE:KR) has teamed up with British online grocery expert Ocado (LON:OCDO).
Kroger said it will disclose the location for the first three U.S. sites out of a planned 20 high-tech Ocado warehouses in the next couple of weeks. They will take about two years to build and each cost Ocado about $39 million.
Ahold Delhaize, the operator of U.S. chains such as Giant Food, Food Lion and Hannaford, acquired Chicago-based online grocer Peapod in 2000 which is still the market leader.
However, growth has slowed at Peapod since Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought Whole Foods and as supermarkets -- including Ahold's own chains like Stop & Shop -- team up with start-ups like Instacart to offer curbside pick-up, or one- to two-hour delivery.
Ahold reported U.S. online sales growth picked up in the third quarter, but Muller said he was still not happy with that.
HAND TO MOUTH
Until now, Ahold's strategy has been largely manual. At its warehouses, known as ""dark stores"", pickers grab items from shelves and put them into crates for packaging and delivery.
Ahold Delhaize has decades of experience in delivering groceries to people's homes, starting in the Netherlands in 1986 when its Albert Heijn chain took orders by phone or fax.
At one Albert Heijn warehouse outside the Dutch city of Eindhoven, pickers each grab an average of one product every 10 seconds, walking about 4.5 km a day. Algorithms work out the shortest path through the aisles, and try to minimize trolley congestion. 
Pawel Kamienczuk, a 28-year-old order picker from Poland, sweats as he races down an aisle, trying to meet a target of 380 items an hour. 
""At the beginning, it took time to get used to it, but now I don't feel tired,"" he said. 
Kamienczuk wears a device like a smartphone on his wrist which tells him where to go and which items to grab next.
He scans each product with a device mounted on his forefinger and puts it into one of 18 blue crates stacked on a large trolley.
Albert Heijn warehouses can pick and pack 135-140 units per labor hour, lower than Kamienczuk's rate because it takes into account work done by others to unload supplies, stack shelves, assemble orders and pack delivery vans.
The figure is also less than the 163 units Ocado reported for the first half of 2018, but analysts say it is impressive given than Albert Heijn's capital outlay for its centers is a fraction of the cost of Ocado's automated warehouses.
Efficiency is key at a time when labor costs are rising in the United States and Europe.
The Dutch jobless rate is at an 18-year low and U.S. unemployment is around the lowest in five decades, wage pressures are rising and companies are increasingly complaining about a scarcity of workers.
Last month, Amazon said it would raise the minimum wage for U.S. workers to $15 an hour, in part to attract staff.
At Ahold's Peapod warehouse in Jersey City, pickers who start on about $12 per hour with benefits can make up to $3.50 an hour extra if they beat speed targets, but they are also closely monitored for quality: a dented tin could mean a refund.
""When we shop, we have many people that check after us,"" said Amal, an expert ""shopper"" who specializes in selecting bananas, Peapod's top selling product.
The Peapod warehouse in New Jersey is the firm's biggest and most sophisticated to date in terms of automation.
There, crates move along conveyer belts to teams of pickers who focus on different food categories, while robots add non-food items like shampoo. Peapod does not share pick times.
Despite the automation, Peapod employs 825 people here, working two shifts from 5 a.m. until 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m. in a warehouse with seven temperature zones.
NEXT DAY VERSUS SAME DAY
Peapod has only offered next-day delivery so far. The partnership with Takeoff will enable the group to offer same-day delivery, or click-and-collect, initially to customers living near a pilot warehouse at a Shop & Stop in Connecticut.
Avallone declined to comment on the financials of the Ahold deal, but said Takeoff should be able to roll out the concept quickly as it takes 16-20 weeks to set up its 10,000 square foot warehouses, which can handle up to $50 million in annual sales.
That contrasts with Ocado's newest facility in Britain, which is a 563,000 square foot site, with a potential annual turnover of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.55 billion).
The U.S. grocery ecommerce market is still in its infancy at just 1.6 percent of sales, but it is expected to more than double by 2023, according to industry research group IGD.
Ahold, which makes almost two thirds of its sales in the United States, wants to boost ecommerce sales to 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) by 2020, or about 8 percent of total turnover, from 2.8 billion in 2017. It will update that target next week.
Its U.S. online sales should near $1 billion by the end of the year as it creates a shared ecommerce infrastructure for all of its store-based brands, along with its online grocery site Peapod, Muller said in August.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:53AM ET</span>",Boeing issues safety bulletin for pilots after Indonesia crash,"By Tim Hepher and David Shepardson
ZHUHAI, China/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday it had issued a safety bulletin reminding pilots how to handle erroneous data from a key sensor in the wake of last week's crash in Indonesia.
The U.S. planemaker said investigators probing the Lion Air crash off the coast of Indonesia, in which all 189 on board were killed, had found that one of the ""angle of attack"" sensors on the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft had provided erroneous data.
Experts say the angle of attack is a crucial parameter that helps the aircraft's systems understand whether its nose is too high relative to the current of air - a phenomenon that can throw the plane into an aerodynamic stall and make it fall.
Some modern aircraft have systems designed to correct the posture of the wings automatically to keep flying safely.
There are also procedures for pilots to follow in the event of missing data from damaged sensors on the fuselage skin, but it remains unclear how much time the crew of flight JT610 had to respond at the relatively low level at which they were flying.
Boeing said its bulletin underscored ""existing flight crew procedures"" designed to address circumstances where the information coming into the cockpit from the sensors was wrong. 
The Boeing 737 MAX has three such sensors but erroneous readings could in some circumstances cause the Boeing 737 MAX to point the nose down sharply in order to keep air under the wings and avoid a stall, according to a person briefed on the matter.
A source said on condition of anonymity that the Boeing bulletin related only to the 737 MAX, of which there are just over 200 in service.
Service bulletins can be followed by airworthiness directives to airlines by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, giving the recommendations extra weight.
Boeing has delivered 219 737 MAX jets to customers globally, with 4,564 orders for jets yet to be delivered.
The Boeing 737 MAX is a more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's best-selling single-aisle 737 series.
The Lion Air crash was the first involving the new version, which airlines introduced into service last year.
Indonesian authorities have downloaded information from the flight data recorder that showed a cockpit indicator on the Lion Air jet was damaged for its last four flights.

A search for the cockpit voice recorder, the second so-called ""black box"", remains underway.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>","Dollar, U.S. bond yields fall, stocks inch higher on Democrat election gains","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open on Wednesday and global stocks rose after significant U.S. election gains for the opposition Democrats, but the outcome may rule out further tax cuts, sending the dollar and Treasury yields sharply lower. 
The Democrats look headed to gain more than 30 seats, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in the House in eight years. With President Donald Trump's Republican party holding onto its Senate majority, the results from Tuesday's elections were in line with expectations.
Moreover, while gridlock in Washington could hamper Trump's political and economic agenda, few expect a reversal of tax cutting and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted.
That view helped all three New York equity indexes to rise around 0.7 percent on Tuesday and they looked set to build on those gains, with S&P500 and Nasdaq futures up 0.7 percent and 1.25 percent respectively (ESc1) (NQc1).
Market sentiment had been volatile in Asian trade with stocks and the dollar swinging on the Republicans' fluctuating prospects of retaining the House. But by 0900 GMT, MSCI's world equity index was up 0.3 percent (MIWD00000PUS), while a pan-European stocks benchmark jumped around one percent (STOXX).
""The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that's now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years and investors will focus back on the fundamentals which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.
On the other hand, most agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump's tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign's links to Russia.
Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump's push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation - measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar, keeping the Federal Reserve on a policy-tightening path.
The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December.
""Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that's a profound change but there will be no repeal of what's already in place,"" Miller said.
That view pushed the dollar 0.4 percent lower against a basket of currencies (DXY). Against the yen, it was 0.4 percent lower at 113.06 , reversing earlier gains to a one-month high of 113.82 yen.
The euro rose almost half a percent to $1.148 (EUR=) a two-week high, while the British pound  gained 0.4 percent to $1.315, clinging to three-week highs hit after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab indicated on Tuesday that a deal on exiting the European Union was likely.
On bond markets, ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields fell below 3.18 percent, down four basis points on the day  as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely.
An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in.
The bond market may remain under pressure from this week's record volumes of longer-dated government debt supply and the yawning Federal deficit. Many also reckon more spending increases are still possible. 
""There are still areas with compromise for spending, so even with a split government I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,"" Steve Friedman, a senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, said.
Attention will also focus on Trump's hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States.
Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat (HSI)
""We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,"" said Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Oil prices were soft after a 2 percent fall the previous day, with Brent crude (LCOc1) futures down 0.25 percent to just below $72 a barrel .

320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 04:38AM ET</span>",BMW third-quarter hit by upfront expenditure for electric car development,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) on Wednesday reported a 27 percent drop in third-quarter operating profit to 1.75 billion euros ($2 billion), missing analyst expectations amid currency headwinds and higher research and development expenses.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had on average expected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to come to 1.795 billion euros.
BMW shares (F:BMWG) fell 2.6 percent in early Frankfurt trade. 
BMW said that despite a slight rise in deliveries of luxury cars, its operating return on sales for the automotive division narrowed to 4.4 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier, well below its targeted range of 8 to 10 percent.
Earnings were hit by higher raw material prices, currency effects, higher provisions for goodwill and warranty measures, tariffs between China and the United States and a price war in Europe, the carmaker said.
BMW made provisions of 679 million euros for vehicle recalls in the third quarter. 
In order to secure enough raw materials for batteries, BMW said it will purchase specific raw materials such as cobalt, and then make them available to battery cell suppliers. 
BMW is establishing a technology consortium with Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt and Belgium's  Umicore  (BR:UMI) to develop a value chain for battery cells in Europe, including development, production and ultimately recycling.
Last month BMW warned its pretax profit would fall this year, against earlier expectations for a flat outcome, and cut its profit margin guidance for cars, blaming intense price competition.
""Compared with 2017, additional upfront expenditure of around 1 billion euros for the mobility of the future and a high three-digit million euro negative impact from exchange-rate and raw materials price developments had been factored into expected earnings for the year,"" BMW said.

BMW had fewer problems than rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler  in terms of selling cars that conform to the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test standard (WLTP), but the onset of the rules has led to supply distortions and heavy discounting in some markets.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 03:38AM ET</span>",Firepower for U.S. stocks may lose spark as Democrats gain clout,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market may be facing the remainder of Donald Trump's presidential term with the prospect of less juice to supercharge it.
Stock returns have been fueled the past year by Trump's corporate tax cuts, which have pumped up profits. Yet, any hope of further fiscal stimulus in the form of more tax cuts faded with the results of Tuesday's congressional elections, with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives from Trump's Republican party.
""The return to political gridlock in Washington will likely serve to temper growth expectations, or at least moderate the prospect of additional stimulative fiscal policy,"" said Jon Hill, US Rates Strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
The election comes as the market is also losing the low-rate monetary policy that has supported equities during its near decade-long bull run, as the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to stave off inflation.
Without both fiscal and monetary stimulus, Wall Street performance will depend even more on fundamental factors at a time investors are looking for signs pointing to when the long economic expansion will finally end.
“This is really not a stock market that needs more fiscal stimulus and I think in order for the bull market to continue what it really needs is strong earnings in the face of what is likely to be increasing interest rates,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Indeed, some investors may see a silver lining in the diminished prospects for more tax cuts, given concerns about the ballooning deficit and even higher interest rates.
“If the Republicans swept today, you would get more fiscal stimulus but that also would likely result in higher interest rates and the Fed moving potentially faster,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""So beyond the initial positive reaction, my sense is that there would be some offsets from higher interest rates.”
At the same time, the potential for some fiscal stimulus is still alive through an infrastructure spending package, an area where analysts say Trump and Democrats could find common ground and where an agreement could boost stocks, particularly shares in construction and materials companies.
HEADWINDS AHEAD 
Tuesday's result of a split Congress, with Republicans keeping control of the Senate, was the most likely scenario projected by polling data and prediction markets ahead of the elections, and had been anticipated by investors. 
Immediate market moves to the news may be misleading. Two years ago, stocks futures plunged when it became clear that Trump would win the presidency, only for them to reverse course within hours.
Stock market gains this year may indeed continue - stocks historically have climbed following midterm elections. For the two calendar years following each national U.S. election, the S&P 500 had a mean annual increase of 12 percent under Republican-controlled governments, compared to an increase of 9 percent for Democratic-controlled governments and a 7 percent rise for gridlocked governments.
Yet replicating the lofty returns of Trump's first half of his term - the stock market is up 29 percent since his election - may prove elusive. 
Democratic control of the House makes the prospect of a new tax-cut package, following the recent steep cut in the U.S. corporate tax rate, appear less likely. Trump has been seeking a 10 percent middle-class tax cut while making permanent individual tax cuts from his 2017 tax overhaul.
The change in House control could bring other challenges for the market. 
Trump's favoring of light regulations for banks and other industries has created a climate that investors say has helped stocks. A Democratic-led House could bring greater oversight on industries such as pharmaceuticals and banks.
With fresh oversight power, Democrats could inspect nearly every aspect of Trump's presidency from his long-elusive tax returns to possible business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest. In the event the House attempts to impeach Trump, history suggests market volatility could spike, at least in the short term, according to OppenheimerFunds. 
But, on the positive side for stocks, analysts doubt Democrats would be able to roll back the heart of the market-friendly changes, including the corporate tax cuts.
The Democrats' victory in the House could also benefit the market, some investors have said, by tempering Trump's aims such as on international trade.
Any pressure on stocks could be less severe because the stock market already endured a steep pullback in October from record highs, which some investors in part attribute to jitters over uncertainty about the election.
And some investors will be happy just to move on from the elections.
""It’s one less thing that’s in front of you that you have to worry about,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.

323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Markets Got the Midterms Right. Now What Happens?,"(Bloomberg) -- For once, the consensus came true. Markets got it right and no violent repricing in equities was needed. A divisive episode of U.S. politics came and went, and investors are exactly where they were before. The question for bulls: can it actually last?
“This was our base case,” said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer of EventShares, which oversees the U.S. Policy Alpha ETF. “As far as markets are concerned, it is actually a decent outcome.”
Perhaps. Bulls can celebrate gridlock, at least, a moderate positive in cycles past. They can be encouraged that something other than a Republican sweep is being taken in stride by futures. The economy is intact. And nothing that happened Tuesday will alter President Donald Trump’s big gift to bulls, a tax cut that made 2018 one of the best years for profit growth ever recorded.
“I know it may be a bit of a letdown from a news perspective, but most of us on the investment side are happy to see a bit of boring and predictable politics this year,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors.
Still, questions remain. How long can any peace persist in a market that before this week spent a month going up and down 2 percent a day? The election is over, one type of uncertainty is subdued. But for equity bulls who watched as their favorite stocks got pummeled by forces that went beyond politics in October, it’s an uneasy truce.
“This issue, thank god, is behind us,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities, said in an interview. “But the other issues are out there.""
Futures on the S&P 500 were up about 5 points as of 11:02 p.m. in New York, shortly after Bloomberg News said Democrats would win the House but not the Senate. It was a stark contrast to last week, when equities finished their worst monthly plunge since 2011.
That’s the issue for investors, though -- that an end to electoral strife doesn’t ensure an end to everything else that tore at investor nerves last month, when $3 trillion was erased from shares. The Federal Reserve is still raising rates, Trump’s trade war shows no sign of easing, and little will arrest the gnawing sense the economy’s best days are behind it.
Add to that a more abstract threat -- “tweet risk,” it’s been called -- the possibility that a recharged opposition will turn the screw on Trump’s vulnerabilities, provoking the president into an even more warlike public posture than he already presents. It’s an unsavory thought for anyone who traded through the president’s pre- and post-market pronouncements as his tariff threats ramped up.
On election night, most investors were happy to put those concerns aside. The economy may be peaking, but for now it’s humming along at a 3 percent clip. Earnings growth will slow, but earnings aren’t: the estimate is for 10 percent gains in each of the next two years. How bad could things be, when after falling 9 percent in October, the Nasdaq 100 is still up 9 percent on the year?
Even more: in the past 18 midterm elections, stocks have gained from the October lows through the end of the year every single time, according to LPL Research.
One optimistic spin holds that October wasn’t an isolated event that was separate from politics. It was politics, the theory goes -- tonight’s election outcome pricing itself in a month in advance. Under that interpretation, bulls can take solace: the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 2000-point correction was the price stocks had to pay for a Republican setback.
At Apriem Advisors in Irvine, California, chief investment officer Benjamin Lau lowered cash to 15 percent from 20 percent just before this election, buying financial and industrial shares to take advantage of cheaper valuations.
“Generally I don’t know if the outcome is going to affect the long term view of the economy,” Lau said Tuesday night. “We’re more concerned just about uncertainty and once it’s passed, the market is going to do better.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2018 01:26AM ET</span>",How Apple is losing its grip on India,"By Arnab Paul and Vibhuti Sharma
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Software engineer Samee Alam was ready to take the big leap and buy an iPhone in this week's Diwali festival sales, but at the last minute he opted for cheaper Chinese competitor OnePlus instead. 
Alam, 27, spends hours on his phone watching shows, surfing and shopping, making him the perfect target for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it strives to raise sales among India's 1.3 billion consumers.
But in a country where the average per capita income is around $2,000 a year, even the cheapest of this year's new iPhones, the XR at 76,900 rupees ($1,058), costs twice as much as many of the alternatives.
Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research says that iPhone sales are falling as a result. From three million phones in 2017, sales may sink to two million this year, according to their estimate, the first decline in four years. 
More than half of those sales will come from cheaper older models, and the lack of progress in India was among problems cited by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook when he gave a disappointing holiday outlook last week. 
Even in the premium segment, smartphones that cost more than $400, Apple lagged Samsung and China's OnePlus in the third quarter.
""I have never used an iPhone and I was keen on getting my hands on one but it didn't make sense,"" says Alam, who works for one of the raft of firms to have invested in the southern city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley.
""I look for storage, camera and processor in phones and cheaper alternatives like OnePlus are more value for the money. The new iPhones cost almost 100,000 rupees - I can get three good phones for that price or even a decent gaming laptop.""
Solid Mac sales and the high unit price of iPhones meant Apple's total revenue of $2 billion in India last year was still double that of OnePlus, which only sells mobile phones. But Counterpoint's data says that gap will also shrink. 
OnePlus' India head Vikas Agarwal told Reuters this week that 10-15 percent of new customers in recent months have been defectors from Apple, suggesting even some loyalists are opting out of upgrading their handsets.
HIGH IMPORT DUTIES
Apple's problems go beyond price.
The company, facing down a handful of regulatory headaches, lost some of its top executives in India at the start of this year.
An Apple spokesman said the departures had nothing to do with the company's performance, but people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the departures were likely linked to the company changing its distribution system. Apple has cut the number of distributors in the country to two from five. 
The sources, who declined to be identified because they have business relationships with Apple, also said company veteran Michel Columb is still working on solidifying business relations since taking control of the Indian operation in December.
Apple declined to comment further. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has sought to drive electronics producers into manufacturing locally by steadily moving tariffs up the supply chain from simple phone cases to sophisticated chipsets and boards.
Along with local firms like Lava, global smartphone giants including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, Oppo and Xiaomi Corp have responded aggressively, investing millions of dollars in plants around Bengaluru and Delhi tech hub Noida. 
Apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in the country and it only assembles two low-cost older models through Wistron Corp in Bengaluru.
Industry experts say as a result the company still imports about 70-80 percent of its phones. That results in high import duties, which in turn make the phones expensive.
In the United States, the basic iPhone XR model costs $749 or roughly 54,400 rupees, only two thirds of its retail price in India. Beyond that, while U.S. phones are subsidized under deals with wireless carriers, Apple's phones in India are not. 
""Apple doesn't have enough confidence ... in the Indian manufacturing system right now, to set up plants and move some of the manufacturing out of China,"" said analyst Navkendar Singh of tech consulting firm IDC. 
""In the process they are losing around 15-20 percent of their tax incentive ... which they could have passed on to the consumer.""
EMPTY STORES
Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is peak selling time for electronics in India, but the Apple-licensed store in one of Bengaluru's big shopping malls was deserted this past Saturday.
""Features of the emerging phones are very similar to an iPhone,"" says salesman Aejaz Ahmed, adding volumes have fallen in the past few months. ""It is very difficult to make out the difference from a distance because they even look so alike.""
Sales staff at several stores in Bengaluru and nearby Chennai pointed to the launch this year of the latest OnePlus phone as a major problem for the U.S. phonemaker. At 37,999 rupees, the Chinese company's 6T is half the price of the XR.
The result, says Neil Shah, from Counterpoint, is that Apple's user base in India is set to decline about 10 percent to nine million users this year. That compares to an estimated 436 million Android users. 

""If your user base is declining, you are losing grip on the market,"" he says. ""The new customer base is not coming.""

331,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 11:16PM ET</span>",China's ties with Taiwan chip firms under scrutiny as U.S. trade war heats up,"By Jess Macy Yu and Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Washington's decision to cut off U.S. supplies to a Chinese chip-maker spotlights mounting tensions over China's drive to be a global player in computer chips and the ways in which Taiwan companies are helping it get there.
Shut out of major global semiconductor deals in recent years, China has been quietly strengthening cooperation with Taiwan chip firms by encouraging the transfer of chip-making expertise into the mainland. 
Taiwan chip giant United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) (TW:2303) last week halted research and development activities with its Chinese state-backed partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd, following the U.S. move. 
Taiwan firms such as UMC have helped supply China with a steady pipeline of chip expertise in exchange for access to the fast-growing chip market there.    
China has faced a shortage of integrated circuit (IC) chips for years. In 2017, it imported $270 billion worth of semiconductors, more than its imports of crude oil. 　
At least 10 joint ventures or technology partnerships have been set up in the last few years between Chinese and Taiwanese firms, according to industry experts, luring Taiwanese talent with hefty salaries and generous perks.
""Such companies will need to also take care to ensure no patent or IP infringement is involved as the U.S. has export control means to restrict support of critical technology,"" said Randy Abrams, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Taipei. 
Among the most valuable cross-strait partnerships for China would be ones that strengthen its foundry services and memory chip production. Those two sectors require much-needed help from overseas firms due to the complexity of the manufacturing technologies and intense capital requirements, analysts have said. 
TRADE TENSIONS 
But the technology transfer between China and self-ruled Taiwan has raised concerns amid the Sino-U.S. trade war and escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 
China has aggressively used ""market-distorting subsidies"" and ""forced technology transfers"" to capture traditional and emerging technology industries, Brent Christensen, the director of America's de facto embassy in Taipei, told a business gathering in late September.
""These actions are harming the United States' economy, Taiwan's economy, and other economies.""
Taiwan is one of the largest exporters of IC globally and many worry the island could lose a key economic engine to its political foe.
Taiwan's government views the island's chipmakers' cooperation with China cautiously and has implemented policies to ensure Taiwan's most advanced technology is not transferred.
""When businesses go to the mainland to invest in wafer production, they must accept controls including one that requires the manufacturing technology to be a generation behind,"" the economics ministry's industrial development bureau said in a statement to Reuters. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONCERNS
Cooperation between UMC and Fujian Jinhua came under scrutiny last month, when the U.S. government put the Chinese company on a list of entities that cannot buy components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms amid allegations it stole intellectual property from U.S.-based Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Fujian Jinhua denied the allegations. 
Fujian Jinhua now faces big challenges to reach commercial high volume production as expected in 2020, industry observers say. 
Last week, both UMC and Fujian Jinhua, which was only founded in 2016, were charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron in a U.S. Justice Department indictment.
""Taiwanese tech companies need to carefully re-evaluate their positions and supply chain arrangements as the tension between the two super powers escalates,"" Bernstein analyst Mark Li said.
While China will need at least six years before it can catch up in chip manufacturing, according to some estimates, the scale of its chip-making abilities is already seen as a threat in other parts of the chip supply chain.
Barely 2-1/2 years after breaking ground on a 12-inch wafer plant in China, Nexchip, a joint venture between the Chinese city of Hefei and Taiwan DRAM maker Powerchip, started producing 8,000 wafers a month. Wafers are thin pieces of material, usually consisting of silicon, used to make semiconductor chips. 
Nexchip's main goal is to produce liquid crystal display driver ICs for flat-panel makers. 
Using Powerchip's resources and Taiwanese talent, which make up a quarter of its 1,200 employees, Nexchip is helping reduce China's reliance on foreign chip suppliers. 
With an aim to become ""the world's No.1 chipmaker for display drivers,"" Nexchip plans to build three more 12-inch wafer plants and ramp up its monthly production to 20,000 wafers by 2019, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
After visiting Nexchip late last year, researchers from Taiwan's chip hub, Hsinchu Science Park, said progress at the Hefei plant was a ""breakthrough"".

""This will likely increase Taiwan firms' needs to invest in the China market, and it will be a test for the (Taiwan) government's industrial policy.""

333,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 06:54PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo executives knew auto insurance program was flawed: lawsuit,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co executives were warned that an auto insurance plan could be overcharging customers four years before the bank scrapped the program, according to a complaint released by a judge this week.
Several executives, including then-General Counsel James Strother and chief auditor David Julian, were among the bank officials briefed in 2012 about possible flaws in the auto insurance program that was ended in 2016, according to parts of a class-action lawsuit that were unsealed on Monday.
A Wells Fargo official declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit but said the bank intended to repay all customers who were hurt.
""We have been reviewing customer accounts and developing a remediation plan – which we hope to finalize very soon,"" said spokeswoman Natalie Brown.
Strother, Julian and other executives named in the lawsuit could not immediately be reached for comment. Last month, regulators warned Julian and another bank official that they could face sanctions for their past work with Wells Fargo.
Wells Fargo ended its auto insurance program in September 2016 after an internal review found many customers were being wrongfully placed in a costly product they did not need.
The bank had a right to force auto borrowers into the product called 'collateral protection insurance' (CPI) if they let their own policies lapse. But ultimately, the bank said some 600,000 customers were forced into CPI unnecessarily when it reached a $1 billion regulatory settlement in April. 
Wells Fargo initially estimated remediation efforts would cost $64 million, but that figure has since swelled as it determined more borrowers were owed greater amounts. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo set aside $241 million for those affected customers.
Its auto insurance abuses are part of a broader scandal over Wells Fargo's treatment of customers. The bank revealed over two years ago that it opened millions of phony accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets.
The San Francisco-based lender has since found sales abuses in businesses ranging from mortgage loans to wealth management.
The lawsuit was originally filed in U.S. District Court, Central District of California, in August. Wells Fargo has fought to keep some details of the case under seal.
The plaintiffs say they are customers seeking reimbursement for wrongful charges, and allege Wells Fargo pushed drivers with poor credit into policies more often than well-off customers.
Wells Fargo was 10 times more likely to force borrowers with damaged credit into CPI insurance than those with high credit scores, according to the lawsuit, which cites an internal bank presentation.

Drivers of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles and others who carried high loan balances were exempted from CPI, according to the lawsuit.

The Louisville, Kentucky-based company said it now expects full-year North America comparable sales to decline in the range of 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent, compared to a prior outlook for a 7 percent to 10 percent decline.
The news sent the company's shares up about 4 percent. 
Papa John's has been trying to rebound after battling with its founder John Schnatter over control of the company. Schnatter was booted as chairman following his usage of a racial slur during a conference call in July.
To counter the bad publicity, the company revamped its advertising, removed Schnatter as the brand's spokesperson, as well as his images from promotional materials, and launched a third-party audit into the brand's culture.
Papa John's said its newly-launched campaign ""Voices of Papa John's"" featuring employees and the chain's franchisees owners helped improve traffic in September.
""We are seeing improved consumer sentiment. Our attention now is on activating that sentiment to drive increased sales,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
The company reported a 9.8 percent sales decline in North America in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had expected a 10.9 percent drop, according to IBES data by Refinitiv.
Papa John's is also focusing on providing assistance to franchises in North America, its biggest market, tackling food-servicing pricing and online fees through 2018.
But the company's plans are coming at a cost. Papa John's said it now expects special charges including rebranding and franchise support to be about $50 million to $60 million this year - higher than the earlier anticipated cost of about $30 million to $50 million.
Papa John's reported a net loss attributable to the company of $13 million or 41 cents per share, compared to a profit of $22 million or 60 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Papa John's earned 20 cents per share missing analysts' estimates of 22 cents. 
Revenue fell 15.7 percent to $364.01 million, missing Wall Street estimates of $393.7 million.

Reuters had reported last week that private equity firms including Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners were interested in buying the pizza chain.

Wendy's, much like its peers, has had to offer cheaper items with added promotions to get people to buy more products.
But its efforts are not bearing fruit, as the company reduced its same-store sales growth forecast for 2018 to about 1 percent from a previous range of 2-2.5 percent.
The company's shares fell 5.8 percent to $16.05 in after-market trading. They have gained 4 percent this year.
Wendy's has launched a slew of promotions including ""4 for $4"", discounted Baconator Fries and a 50-cent Frosty dessert that compete with bundled meals offered by McDonald's $1, $2, $3 menu and Taco Bell's dollar menu.
Customers have a large range of cheap fast-food options from many chains and keeping sales robust is becoming challenging for many big outlets. 
Wendy's same-restaurant sales in North America fell 0.2 percent in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected same-store sales to rise 1.84 percent, according to IBES data by Refinitiv.
Net income rose to $391.2 million, or $1.60 per share, in the third quarter, from $13.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, the company earned 17 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 15 cents per share.
Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $400.6 million, missing expectations of $405.36 million.

Franchisee royalty and franchisee rental revenue, which contribute to about 38 percent of the company's net sales, rose 3 percent to $153.7 million in the third quarter.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",UK PM May sets up business councils to advise on post-Brexit policy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May has created five new business councils to advise on issues facing core sectors of the economy as Britain leaves the European Union, her office said on Tuesday.
With less than five months before Britain is due to quit the bloc and no exit deal yet agreed, business leaders have been demanding greater certainty over the kind of trade terms the divorce will deliver. 
The government said each of the councils would be chaired by two business leaders and would be made up of around 10 members. They will meet three times a year; twice with the prime minister and once with a senior minister, and provide policy recommendations.
""I've asked these new councils to advise us on the opportunities and challenges facing business as we shape the UK for the future,"" May said in a statement.
The government has been stepping up its engagement with business. Last week, May and finance minister Philip Hammond met around 150 executives to discuss their concerns about Britain's imminent departure from the EU.
May will host the co-chairs of the new business councils at her Downing Street office on Wednesday to set out their objectives and discuss cross-sector issues such as productivity and international investment, her office said. 
The ""Financial, Professional and Education Services"" council will be chaired by  Prudential  (L:PRU) Chairman Paul Manduca and Santander (MC:SAN) UK Chairman Shriti Vadera, while BAE Systems (L:BAES) Chairman Roger Carr and Rolls-Royce (L:RR) Chairman Ian Davis will head the ""Industrial, Infrastructure and Manufacturing"" council.
There will also be a ""Telecoms, Creative Industries, Technology and Media"" council headed by BT Group (L:BT) Chairman Jan du Plessis and  ITV  (L:ITV) Chief Executive Carolyn McCall.
The final two councils will cover ""Consumer, Retail and Life Sciences"", chaired by  Tesco  (L:TSCO) Chief Executive Dave Lewis and GSK (L:GSK) Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, and ""Small Business, Scale ups and Entrepreneurs.""

Each council will also have a representative of a relevant business lobby group, the government said.

339,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Here’s What’s Coming Up at Day Two of the New Economy Forum,"(Bloomberg) -- Day Two of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore kicks off on Wednesday.
Hank Paulson, chairman of the Paulson Institute and former U.S. Treasury Secretary, is scheduled to start events with opening remarks at 8 a.m.
Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be on a panel soon after, with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). CEO Larry Fink, KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also set to speak. David Rubenstein, the co-founder of The  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), will discuss the results of the U.S. midterm elections.
Michael Bloomberg, Lagarde and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam are due to wrap up the event at 2:50 p.m. The forum is organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
For a full run down of Wednesday’s schedule, click here.
Here are the takeaways from Day One:
Singapore is No Brexit Model
Singapore is not a model for post-Brexit Britain, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.
“Maybe, maybe if you look at Singapore, you might think you have some ideas that you can use, we hope so,” Lee said in an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “But I don’t think you can take one society’s solution and just plonk it on a different society.”
While some lawmakers hope Britain can become an export-rich, low-bureaucracy economy like Singapore, Lee said one key difference is that his state spends just 16 percent of gross domestic product compared to around 40 percent spent by the British government.
Stark Warning
Henry Kissinger, the 95-year-old foreign policy guru, had a blunt message for the packed audience of business leaders, diplomats and academics: If the U.S. and China don’t sort out their growing rivalry, things could get messy.
“If the world order becomes defined by continuous conflict between the U.S. and China, sooner or later it risks getting out of control,” Kissinger said on Tuesday.
The former secretary of state to President Richard Nixon was hopeful that a worst-case scenario could be avoided.
“The objective needs to be that both countries recognize that a fundamental conflict between them will destroy hope for the world order,” he said. “That objective can be achieved and I am, in fact, fairly optimistic that it will be achieved.”
Trade Optimism
A top deputy to Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing remained ready to discuss a trade solution with the U.S., but cautioned the country wouldn’t again be “bullied and oppressed” by foreign powers.
Vice President Wang Qishan, one of China’s best-known economic reformers, said trade was still the “anchor and propeller of China-U.S. relations.” He prefaced his support for talks -- a refrain Chinese leaders have repeated for months -- with a warning about the dangers of “right-leaning populism” and “unilateralism.”
Trade Pessimism
Not everyone is convinced that a trade deal is doable.
“We’re going to see these two sides continue to dig in their heels,” Scott Kennedy, deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Bloomberg Television. “For President Trump, even though he’s signaling that it’s possible they want a deal, there’s actually no monster benefit to him economically or politically. So I think they’ll continue to do this dance and all of us will continue to watch.”
Trump Effect
As delegates await the outcome of the U.S. midterm elections, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had this to say about America’s withdrawal from international structures: “The world including China looks at that and says, ‘Hmm, this is different, this is new.’ We do not now know, including China, what America believes is its future global role.”
Rudd also sounded downbeat on the U.S.-China relationship.
“There is a deep realization in Beijing that there is a fundamental shift in the American take on China,” he said. “They see China no longer as a status quo power but as changing the international realities.”
Too Big To Fail
The World Trade Organization must be reformed in order to shore up the global trading system, and China has a major role to play in that process, former EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said. China’s juggernaut economy poses a huge challenge to the international trading system and the nation needs to do much more to help reform the WTO in order to avoid a “Trumpian disaster,” he said.
“The WTO has almost become too big to avoid failing,” he said.
Fellow panelist Frederick Smith, the chairman and chief executive of FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)., channeled economist Joseph Schumpeter and his theory of creative destruction, and said the “proven formula for success” for world trade is zero tariffs and barriers. He said the solution to the growing global unease about economic inequality may not lie with governments, pointing to the millions of dollars his companies are investing in staff to create the workers of the future.
Yellen Speaks
Yellen warned that “regulations are in many ways burdensome and probably need to be revisited, but now is not the time to loosen the safeguards” that were put in place after the last financial crisis. She gave a nod to the benefits the U.S. labor market was enjoying at full employment, especially for more vulnerable workers, and noted that the unemployment rate for black Americans was hovering close to an historic low.
Supply Chains
While more companies are reconsidering their supply chains because of the trade war, moving plants out of China will be costly and time-consuming -- and it’s not always simple to find suppliers in other countries. That was one of the lines of discussion on a panel featuring company executives including John Flint, chief executive officer of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
Supply chains are very complex systems and the U.S.-China trade conflict is just one variable among many, he said. Still, rising tariffs will bring pain, with Flint saying: “A 10 percent shot is digestible. A 25 percent shot is of a different magnitude.”
Marjorie Yang, who heads Esquel Group, had a different take. Her company is one of the world’s leading producers of premium cotton shirts, with production facilities in China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.
“With this trade war, everyone is scared. That’s good,” she said. “I’m using this trade war as a shock effect. We’ve been trying to get people to change the way we manage.”
FedEx’s Smith said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the company is in talks with some of its customers looking to move part of their supply chain out of China to other parts of Asia, such as Vietnam and Thailand.
Kerry Logistics Network Ltd. Chairman George Yeo said the U.S.-China trade dispute has accelerated the outflow of investments from lower-level manufacturing in China, a process that had already begun because of rising costs in the country.
Governance
Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s leader-in-waiting, spoke of the need for authentic democracy and governance -- topical issues for a country dealing with the fallout of a major corruption scandal. The current president of the People’s Justice Party, Anwar said it would be “inexcusable” if  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). were complicit in the scandal surrounding state investment company 1Malaysia Development Bhd., calling it a failure of governance by financial institutions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68%. The S&P 500 rose 0.59%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.64%.
As the U.S. midterm elections got underway Tuesday, investors appeared to keep their powder dry until there was clearer picture of how they would shake out, with consensus indicating a split Congress the likely outcome.
While many fear a split Congress could lead to political gridlock in Washington, stifling President Donald Trump's ability to further implement expansive fiscal policy measures, some on Wall Street reminded investors that markets generally do well under in those times.
""Markets generally do well under gridlock,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""A modest infrastructure bill might see bipartisan support, which could lift industrials and materials.""
Upbeat earnings from companies in the materials sector, meanwhile, teased some investors into the market, underpinning the broader averages.
Fertilizer company Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) rose 10.6% as earnings missed by penny, but revenue topped expectations. Building materials producer Martin Marietta (N:NYSE:MLM) gained 8.4% following its above-forecast earnings report.
Health care stocks were also in focus following strong results from Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).
Both Mylan and CVS Health posted earnings that beat estimates, sending their shares higher. But Eli Lilly stumbled after its above-forecast earnings and revenue were overshadowed by mixed results from key products.
Goldman Sachs has tipped the health care sector to rally should the midterm elections lead to a divided Congress, as the chances of major regulatory changes proposed by Trump would likely be mitigated.
Energy names struggled to participate in the broader market rally as U.S. oil prices slumped after the United States granted waivers to some of Iran's biggest customers, allowing them to continue buying oil from the Islamic Republic.
On the economic front, job openings eased in September, but remained near record highs.
The U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in September fell to about 7.009 million from the prior month, missing expectations for 7.100 million.
On the corporate news front, Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) surged 12.6% after private equity firm Thomas Bravo reportedly approached the company with a possible buyout offer, according to Reuters.
But confidential sources had indicated to Reuters that there was no certainty that discussions between company and the private equity firm will lead to a deal.

344,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 03:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Midterms, Midterms, Midterms
That could easily be the three things that move the markets tomorrow. Stocks will be all about reacting to the election results.
Shares finished up today, but investors will be watching results from across the U.S. closely. Exit polls will start to come in at 5 PM ET (22:00 GMT).
Wall Street tends to prefer a GOP victory under the theory that Republican governments are friendlier toward business and prefer fewer regulations. But the market has been jolted amid the more populist moves by President Donald Trump and those could be tempered by a Democratic win in the House.
What probably doesn’t hold water is the idea that government gridlock is an impediment to stock gains, given the tremendous current bull run, which continued through times of intense partisan battling.
If the Democrats do take control of the House, stocks could still benefit from a likely bipartisan agreement to boost infrastructure spending, according to Briefing.com, which outlined the impact on different sectors based on three election scenarios.
GOP control of Congress would likely benefit the defense sector and raise the possibility of a capital gains tax cut. A surprise Democratic victory to take both houses of Congress would spell trouble for fossil fuel companies, Briefing.com said.
2. Humana, Retail Results Come Ahead of Trading
While politics will dominate the headlines and airwaves, there are plenty of earnings reports before and after the bell that will move individual stocks.
Insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) weighs in ahead of trading.
On average, analysts expect Humana to post a profit of $4.27 per share on revenue of a little less than $14 billion.
The stock is little changed in the last month but shows solid gains year to date.
Humana could also react to the midterm results, as a continued Republican majority in both houses could lead to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, limiting visibility for health insurers.
In retail ahead of trading,  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP) reports numbers and Michael Kors (NYSE:KORS) issues results.
Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) will also report as it moves to completes the sale of its film business and some TV assets to  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).
After the bell investors will get a glimpse of how the beverage business is performing, with numbers from Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) out and the latest numbers from  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST).
3. Oil Inventories on Tap
Oil prices could continue their downward trajectory tomorrow, depending on how the latest inventory data turn out.
Crude oil futures fell today, with sellers convinced that the Trump administration’s sanction waivers given to buyers of Iranian crude should leave enough supply.
Eight importers of Iranian crude -- China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey -- will be allowed to continue buying from the Islamic Republic ""temporarily,"" the Trump administration announced on Monday.
The market learned on Tuesday that the waivers will be for 180 days.
The latest U.S. stockpiles numbers come at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
Analysts predict week oil inventories rose by 2.433 million barrels, compared with a build of 3.217 million."

346,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Trump Tariffs Spur Demand for Brazilian Tractors,"(Bloomberg) -- News that one of the top U.S. tractor companies is dropping made-in-China products should be music to the Trump administration’s ears -- except for the fact that it’s replacing them with machines made in Brazil.
AGCO Corp. is turning to Brazilian factories for a new line of low-horsepower tractors to avoid the 25 percent tariff put in place by the U.S on Chinese products, Chief Executive Officer Martin Richenhagen told reporters in Sao Paulo Tuesday. He projects tractor exports from Brazil to the U.S. to reach 4,000 to 5,000 units next year.
It’s the latest unintended consequence of a trade war between the two largest economies that’s roiling markets and tempering growth expectations.
Both Duluth, Georgia-based AGCO and its larger rival Deere & Co. have warned about negative impacts from a trade war. AGCO has said that tariffs are putting additional pressure on farmers, while Deere has stressed its support for open markets and free trade.
Still, AGCO’s tractor sales in Brazil may also get a boost as China replaces American soybeans with those grown in the South American farming powerhouse.

347,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: Mylan Surges to Keep Health Care Stocks Well Above Flatline,"Investing.com - A pulsating rally in shares of Mylan and CVS Health Tuesday offset weakness in Eli Lilly, keeping the broader health care sector well above the flatline.
Mylan's third-quarter revenue fell short of estimates, but profit more than doubled, resurrecting bullish calls from Wall Street analysts, many of whom had previously claimed the drug company was on the brink of disaster following poor second-quarter results. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) shares surged more than 17%.
J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said that recent weakness in Mylan shares was ""overdone,” asserting that the drug company was ""one of the better-positioned players in the space with a number of longer-term growth drivers in place (biosimilars, the pending genetic Advair approval, a significant ex-US business).”
Mylan's stock, however, remains down roughly 10% so far this year.
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) posted earnings and revenue that beat on both the top and bottom lines Tuesday and said the acquisition of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) would be completed before Thanksgiving, sending its shares more than 5% higher.
An improving pharmacy retail business bolstered the company's performance in the third quarter as earnings of $1.73 a share on revenue of $47.3 billion beat Wall Street estimates.
Diabetes specialist Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), meanwhile, fell 4% shrugging off a third-quarter earnings and revenue beat as mixed results from key products weighed on performance.
Lilly's diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis medicine Taltz topped Wall Street forecasts, but newer treatments fell short.
""Performance of key products that are part of the new product story were mixed,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said.
The S&P 500 Health Care index rose 0.60%."
348,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Diesel decline to fuel auto demand for aluminum: Constellium,"PARIS (Reuters) - The decline of diesel engines will support the growing use of aluminum in vehicles as the auto industry pursues lighter models to meet emissions targets, the head of aluminum parts maker Constellium (N:CSTM) said on Tuesday.
As a lighter but costlier alternative to steel, aluminum has become a significant part of premium car models and efforts to bring electric-powered vehicles to the mass market has also raised the prospect of wider aluminum use.
""If diesel is struggling then in a way it's good for aluminum,"" Constellium Chief Executive Jean-Marc Germain told Reuters. ""Aluminum is very well placed to help reduce emissions.""
Diesel's reputation was tarnished by an emissions test-cheating scandal at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) while distrust of their greater release of nitrogen oxides and particulates has overshadowed their lower CO2 emissions compared with gasoline.
Politicians are calling for bans on diesel vehicles while the European Union is discussing new rules to cut car emissions limits by around a third by 2030.
Despite recent successes for steel in models such as the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 3 and the Audi 8, Constellium has kept a medium-term projection of 10-20 percent annual growth in automobile demand for aluminum, seeing further uptake as car makers shift toward lighter, multi-material solutions.
""Most of the time, aluminum replaces steel while steel replaces steel,"" Germain said.
Aluminum's challenger role in the car industry is the opposite of its position in planemaking, in which its historical dominance has been eroded by plastic composite materials.
German reiterated a previous outlook for 2 percent annual growth in aeronautic demand for aluminum, about half the level seen in the past.
Constellium is among the world's largest suppliers of aluminum products alongside peers including Arconic (N:ARNC) and Novelis.
In response to the threat of U.S. sanctions against major aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486), Constellium has re-allocated to other suppliers for next year the primary metal it had sourced from the Russian firm, Germain said, reiterating this represented just 2-3 percent of its metal intake.
Constellium was not having problems securing aluminum supply from its pool of suppliers and these firms were not showing concern about a supply squeeze in either aluminum or input alumina due to the Rusal issue, he said.
Constellium, which reported third-quarter core earnings of 114 million euros, up 2 percent year-on-year, is not looking for acquisitions as it focuses on a plan to reduce debt, Germain said.
The company, whose roots lie in the French aluminum industry, plans to move its headquarters back to France next year and scrap its current head office in the Netherlands, Germain said, adding its shares would remain listed in New York.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 01:27PM ET</span>",German prosecutors search BlackRock in dividend-stripping inquiry: source,"By John O'Donnell and Matthias Inverardi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Prosecutors searched the Munich offices of BlackRock (N:BLK) on Tuesday, a person with knowledge of the matter said, as part of the country's largest post-war fraud investigation.
The practice being investigated, known as cum-ex, typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each of whom was entitled to a tax rebate. 
A BlackRock spokesman said the world's biggest fund manager was ""fully cooperating with an ongoing investigation relating to cum ex transactions in the period 2007-2011"". 
BlackRock's inclusion is significant because it oversees more than $6.4 trillion in assets, including company shares which it lends to banks as part of its business. 
State prosecutors in Cologne declined to comment on the search of BlackRock, which came as Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, urged Europe to tighten cooperation against abusive tax schemes, after Reuters and other media revealed sham trading deals that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
Numerous banks and investors are already being investigated over the sham trading. 
BlackRock's chairman in Germany, Friedrich Merz, who has helped secure its influence in Europe's industrial powerhouse, took his current role in 2016 -- after the period being investigated -- and has condemned illicit dividend stripping.
Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor as soon as next year.
""SCANDAL"" 
Cologne prosecutors also searched offices of Unicredit's (MI:CRDI) HypoVereinsbank to gather evidence in proceeding against other suspects, a source close to the matter said. 
Unicredit declined to comment on the search of its German unit, which was reported earlier by Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 
Earlier this week, Scholz described the stock-trading scheme as a ""scandal"" that underscored the need for better European cooperation in his strongest yet condemnation of the practice, which has hit Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium.
Tax authorities in Denmark say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros ($5.71 billion) by a similar method.
Danish politicians called for action after Reuters and other media, coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv, revealed the large-scale use of such schemes. 
German prosecutors think the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.

Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012, but the scam then hit Denmark, where authorities have subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe.

The EU competition regulator said in a statement that Disney had committed to divest its interests in channels including History and Lifetime in the European Economic Area (EEA) to avoid harming competition following its purchase from Fox.
""The decision is conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by Disney,"" the Commission said.
The channels it must end its interest in are History, H2, Crime & Investigation, Blaze and Lifetime channels -- currently controlled by A+E Television Networks, a joint venture between Disney and Hearst. 
Disney secured approval from the U.S. Justice Department for the deal in June on condition after agreeing to sell Fox's 22 regional sports networks.
The deal would expand Disney's unrivalled portfolio of some of the world's most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox's X-Men, ""Avatar"" and ""The Simpsons"" franchises.
Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox's stake in Hulu.

(In this story the Commission corrects statement to say that channels are controlled, not owned, by A+E and that A+E is not a channel)

365,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>","KKR, Allianz among four contenders for Altice Europe fiber sale: sources","By Pamela Barbaglia and Gwénaëlle Barzic
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Rival consortia led by U.S. buyout fund KKR (N:KKR) and Germany's insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) are among the four main contenders for a stake in the fiber network business of Dutch-based telecom company Altice (AS:ATCA), sources said.
The two other bidding groups are led by Australian investment firm Macquarie (AX:MQG) and U.S. infrastructure fund I Squared Capital respectively, four sources close to the deal told Reuters.
Altice's majority owner Patrick Drahi is trying to pay down Altice Europe's 32 billion-euro debt pile and share the burden of ploughing cash into the costly roll-out of its fiber optic network in France.
Altice, which runs France's second biggest telecom operator SFR, is selling a stake of between 40 and 60 percent in its fiber network business, a deal that could be worth up to 3.6 billion euros ($4.11 billion), the sources said.
The sale has also drawn interest from a number of long-term investors.
Canadian pension fund manager OMERS has teamed up with Allianz while Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC has joined forces with I Squared Capital, one of the sources said.
Altice and Allianz declined to comment. KKR, Macquarie, I Squared Capital, GIC and OMERS were not immediately available for comment.
Altice has asked bidders to submit their final proposals in late November but the deadline could be further extended, the sources said. The sources said the winner will not be selected until mid or late December.
The business may raise anything between 1.8 and 3.6 billion euros but the price will largely depend on the final terms of the agreement between Altice Europe's infrastructure business and its telecom carrier, the sources said.
Altice wants to share the same degree of governance control with the investors and have a say on key decisions, they said.
In June, the Dutch-based group raised 2.5 billion euros in by selling stakes in its telecoms towers businesses in France and Portugal.
KKR won the auction for the French towers and formed a new company called SFR TowerCo, comprising 10,198 sites operated by Altice's French subsidiary SFR. 
In Portugal,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Infrastructure Partners and Horizon Equity Partners bought 75 percent of a newly-formed domestic towers business.
Altice remains in restructuring mode with Drahi fighting to revive its fortunes after growing rapidly in recent years through a series of acquisitions.
A sudden loss of investors' confidence in Drahi's commercial results in France caused a steep fall in the stock about 10 months ago, triggering the departure of the chief executive, a strategic turnaround plan and the separation of Altice's European and U.S. divisions.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 11:43AM ET</span>",Maersk family ousts Danske Bank chairman after scandal,"By Teis Jensen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) largest shareholder, the Maersk family, has ousted the lender's chairman after a money laundering scandal that has also forced out its chief executive.
A.P. Moller Holding, which controls about 21 percent of the share capital in the bank, has nominated Karsten Dybvad, who currently heads the Confederation of Danish Industry, to replace Ole Andersen as chairman of Denmark's largest bank.
The move is a rare example of Denmark's Maersk family, which controls shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) through A.P. Moller Holding, openly flexing its muscles to seek change at one of its investments.
""We make this move because we think that Danske's board has not reacted swiftly enough to find a replacement for the current chairman,"" said Robert Uggla, CEO of A.P. Moller Holding.
Andersen, who was appointed chairman seven years ago, has agreed to step down from the board at an extraordinary general meeting to be held within two weeks.
""I share the perception of the need for a new board, and as I have previously announced I also believe it is right for me to leave the chairmanship to new forces,"" Andersen said in a statement.
The change follows a scandal that involved 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank has said it thinks are suspicious.
Danske is the subject of criminal investigations in Denmark, Estonia and the United States and could face sizeable fines. 
""Denmark needs a big bank with activities across the Nordic region,"" Uggla said on a conference call. ""The bank is essential for Denmark's financial system and infrastructure and offers important services for many Danish businesses, investors and start-ups.""
TURMOIL
A new chairman is needed ""to strengthen the bank's ability to address its culture, compliance program and engagement with regulators"", he added. 
The Maersk-family - a major shareholder in  Danske Bank  since 1928 - has about $20 billion under management through its holding company. 
Danske Bank Chief Executive Thomas Borgen quit in September when the group published its report into the transactions.
Turmoil at the bank deepened the following month when Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the board's choice to take over as chief executive, was rejected by the country's financial regulator because of a lack of experience.
Uggla said the nomination of Dybvad is backed by the board and major shareholders, such as Danish pension funds PFA and ATP, and will enable the board to finalize its search for a new CEO. He declined to give specifics on timing or potential candidates.
Dybvad, meanwhile, told Reuters: ""Danske bank is the central and most fundamental financial institution in Denmark. It's essential that it continues to develop and that it holds public trust.""
Apart from his role as head of an industry lobby group, Dybvad is chairman of Copenhagen Business School and has previously worked in government positions and at pension funds. 
""Dybvad is known for his integrity, and many of those I have been in contact with speak about his moral compass. He is also known for his strong social commitment,"" Uggla said. 
A.P. Moller Holding also nominated Jan Nielsen, who is chief investment officer in the holding company and a member of the board at toymaker LEGO, as vice-chairman of Danske Bank.
Danske Bank shares, which have shed nearly half their value since March, were 0.2 percent down at Tuesday's close.

Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock rose about 4% at 11:30 AM ET (16:30 GMT).
The company changed its name from Priceline.com -- one of the stalwarts of the early dot-com companies known for its name-your-price tool and commercials by William Shatner -- to reflect its broader portfolio.
Along with Priceline.com, the company also operates Booking.com, airline flight site KAYAK and restaurant reservation site OpenTable.
At first blush, earnings after the bell Monday looked like a big disappointment. Booking reported a profit $37.78 a share, which was far from the consensus estimate of $38.18.
But earnings were above the company’s own guidance and revenue of $4.85 billion topped the Street forecast. The company also guided quarterly profit above current expectations.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>",Motel 6 to pay $7.6 million for giving guest lists to U.S. immigration,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Motel 6 will pay up to $7.6 million to Hispanic guests to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit claiming that it violated their privacy by regularly providing guest lists to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents.
Terms of the preliminary settlement with eight Hispanic plaintiffs - seven from Arizona and one from Washington state - were disclosed in a Nov. 2 filing with the federal court in Phoenix.
Motel 6 also agreed to a two-year consent decree barring it from sharing guest data with immigration authorities absent warrants, subpoenas, or threats of serious crime or harm.
Court approval is required. Motel 6 did not admit liability, and denied engaging in unlawful conduct. 
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed the lawsuit after the Phoenix New Times said ICE agents had arrested 20 people over six months at Motel 6s in Arizona, using guest lists to target people by national origin.
""Motel 6 fully recognizes the seriousness of the situation and accepts full responsibility for both compensating those who were harmed and taking the necessary steps to ensure that we protect the privacy of our guests,"" Motel 6 and MALDEF said in a joint statement.
A settlement had been reached in July, but no terms were disclosed at the time.
The terms were announced shortly before the U.S. midterm elections, in which President Donald Trump has made immigration a central issue.
Up to $5.6 million will go to Motel 6 guests who faced immigration removal proceedings after their personal information was shared. They are eligible to receive at least $7,500 each.
Another $1 million was set aside for guests who were questioned or interrogated by immigration authorities, with each guest receiving $1,000.
The remaining $1 million will go to guests whose information was turned over to immigration authorities from Feb. 1, 2017 to Nov. 2, 2018. They will receive $50 each.
Motel 6 will also pay up to $1.3 million for the plaintiffs' legal fees and administrative costs.
The chain is controlled by the private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, which bought the brand in 2012.
Motel 6's management company, G6 Hospitality, has said it ordered its more than 1,400 U.S. and Canadian locations in September to stop voluntarily giving guest lists to ICE agents.

The case is Jane V. et al v Motel 6 Operating LP et al, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona, No. 18-00242.

The bank said in a filing with regulators that an expanded review found that 870 customers were incorrectly denied mortgage changes, leading to 545 of them losing their homes.
This comes after the bank in August had for the first time disclosed a calculation error in an internal underwriting software had caused 625 borrowers to be incorrectly denied mortgage loan modifications under a federal assistance program, 400 of whom had their homes foreclosed upon.
""We're very sorry that the errors occurred and have assigned a single, dedicated point of contact to ensure that each customer is engaged with and assisted individually,"" Tom Goyda, a spokesman for the company, said in an email. 
The company said the expanded review is still under way and took into account customers who were in the foreclosure process between March 15, 2010, and April 30, 2018.
Goyda said the bank had contacted a substantial majority of the affected customers to provide remediation as well as the option to pursue no-cost mediation with an independent mediator.
The revelations are an additional headache for the San Francisco-based bank which is facing numerous regulatory penalties and private lawsuits, most of which stem from a sales practices scandal that touched on all of the bank's major business units. 
The bank said the issue stems from a calculation error that overstated attorneys' fees that were needed in determining whether a customer qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. 
In August, the bank said it rectified the calculation errors and had set aside $8 million to compensate borrowers. On Tuesday, the bank, however, did not update that figure. 
The bank updated disclosures on issues it discovered in auto lending, saying it had increased a compensation figure to $241 million from $212 million earlier, related to a practice where it forced customers auto insurance that in some cases resulted in vehicle repossessions.
The bank has since discontinued that practice.

(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS), which expects to close its $69 billion purchase of  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) this month, reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates on higher sales of prescription drugs. 
Shares of the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) were up 2.7 percent at $75.70 in morning trading. 
The company said it believes the Aetna deal will help it save more than $750 million in costs in the second year after it closes, as the combination reduces corporate expenses as well as produces ""some"" cuts in medical costs from decreased emergency room visits. 
""The longer term medical cost savings will come from new programs that are only made possible through the combination and close integration of our two companies,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Menlo said on call with analysts. 
CVS, which last month won U.S. Department of Justice approval to buy Aetna, said it reached agreement with the state of California on the acquisition and expects to finalize terms over the coming days. The deal is expected to close before the Thanksgiving holiday, which falls on Nov. 22, CVS said. 
The combination is expected to reshape the healthcare sector as it brings together one of the largest PBMs and one of the nation's oldest health insurers.
CVS could offer more preventive care services and screenings to Aetna customers in its clinics, such as enabling diabetes patients to monitor blood sugar levels, avoiding higher cost visits to doctors or emergency rooms. 
Pharmacy same-store sales rose 8.7 percent in the quarter, while analysts were expecting a 7.7 percent rise. 
Front end of the store same-store sales rose 0.8 percent versus analysts' expectations of an 0.8 percent drop, despite brick-and-mortar drugstore chains like CVS coming under increasing pressure from consumer shifts to online options.
Sales of beauty products at CVS stores have benefited from promotions and newer offerings. Last year, the company announced a initiative to offer over a hundred new South Korean beauty brands at its stores.
Excluding items, CVS Health said it earned $1.73 per share, topping analysts' average estimates by 2 cents. 
Net revenue rose 2.4 percent to $47.27 billion, beating expectation of $47.18 billion.
Net income rose to $1.39 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter. Its income tax provision declined by $268 million. (https://

377,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Big funds haven't been this heavily invested in stocks since the tech bubble — here's why that puts the market in a very dangerous position heading into 2019,"If you thought the stock market's horrid October would be enough to convince traders to dump stocks, think again.
In fact, recent data from Goldman Sachs actually finds the opposite.
Rather than shedding equity exposure, investors including households, mutual funds, pension funds, and foreign investors are holding more stocks than at any point since 2000.
As if that lofty level of risk isn't enough, Goldman finds that this investor base is also holding a record-low portion in cash — 12% of their portfolios, to be exact. Further, the group has allocated just 25% to bonds. That's below average, and surprisingly low considering interest rates are climbing from historically low levels.
In other words, the madness that engulfed stocks in October wasn't enough to derail risk appetite for a large contingency of investors. And it's created a potentially dangerous situation for stocks heading into 2019.
That's because a lot of faith is being placed in a handful of stock-supportive forecasts. And not a lot of mind is being paid to the rapidly deteriorating conditions that led to the rocky October in the first place.
The aforementioned group's continued enthusiasm for holding stocks is likely explained by a bullish outlook for 2019. Note that Goldman is forecasting a 5% return for the equity market.
However, a lot has to transpire on an equity-demand basis for stocks to continue on an upward trend next year. Goldman estimates that corporations will be ""by far"" the biggest driver, accounting for $700 billion in equity demand in 2019.
That's all well and good, but it gets decidedly more dicy when you consider that the outflows Goldman expects from pension funds (-$100 billion), mutual funds (-$125 billion), and households (-$175 billion) will offset a significant portion of that corporate share demand.
When you factor in that Goldman's bullish forecast also hinges on rosy demand forecasts for foreign investors (+$100 billion) and exchange-traded funds (+$300 billion), there's a lot that could go wrong — and a great deal of potential downside should anything surprise the market.
In the end, there's nothing in this equation that suggests an imminent reckoning in stocks. What it does show, however, is how precarious stock-market stability has gotten. Both profit growth and the tax cuts that have driven the most recent leg up have peaked. That's going to leave stocks without a valuable pair of allies as they navigate the rocky waters ahead. 
If investors were more defensively positioned, they might be better equipped to withstand more bouts of instability. But as Goldman's data suggests, any cautious shift from this point forward might come too late."

The wide-body, 257-seat model features new engines from Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and is designed as a lower-cost alternative to all-new long-haul jets like the A350 and Boeing 787.
A larger and more successful model called the A330-900 is due to be delivered to first customer TAP Portugal later this month, but ownership is concentrated among relatively few airlines and Airbus hopes for more sales to ensure a return.
The two aircraft are collectively known as the A330neo family.
Development of both jets has been delayed by late engine deliveries from Rolls-Royce.
The A330-800 had until recently been left with no customers after Hawaiian Airlines canceled an order, but Airbus announced last month it had won an order for eight from Kuwait Airways.
Industry sources said that order had, however, been achieved at the expense of at least some of Kuwait's orders for 10 costlier A350s, which Airbus had agreed to forgo in order to help kickstart the A330-800.
Airbus has declined to comment on the transaction.
Airbus says the A330neo is more efficient than the Boeing 787 because it costs less to buy and maintain. Boeing (N:BA) argues its lightweight 787 offers savings that outweigh the higher purchase cost and that higher oil prices will only reinforce this.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 09:28AM ET</span>",EU digital tax plan flounders as states ready national moves,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European Union plan to tax big internet firms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on their turnover was on the verge of collapsing on Tuesday after several EU governments rejected it and announced national initiatives instead.
Under a proposal from the EU's executive Commission in March, EU states would charge a 3 percent levy on the digital revenues of large firms that are accused of averting tax by routing their profits to the bloc's low-tax states. 
The plan is aimed at changing tax rules that have let some of the world's biggest companies pay unusually low rates of corporate tax on their earnings.
But it requires the support of all 28 EU states and is opposed by a number of them, including small, low-tax countries like Ireland that have benefited by allowing multinationals to book profits there on digital sales to customers elsewhere.
While the harshest criticism had previously taken place behind closed doors, on Tuesday many EU finance ministers voiced their concerns at a meeting in Brussels that was streamed over the internet, allowing their disputes to be aired publicly. 
Germany, which initially had backed the plan, urged for the first time a revision that would exclude from the scope of the new tax activities that could be linked to carmakers. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz also said the tax should not be applied until the summer of 2020, and only if no global deal was reached on the same issue.
France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has long been the main supporter of the tax, accepted delaying its implementation to the end of 2020, a major concession. But he said the EU should still reach agreement on the issue by the end of this year, to avoid states applying their own national taxes, in moves he said would harm the EU single market.
Spain and Britain have announced their own national plans to tax digital companies, and reiterated their intention to move ahead without waiting for an EU deal. The Italian finance minister Giovanni Tria said Italy would also proceed alone if no EU agreement was reached by the end of the year.
Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said it will make its last attempt for an agreement at a meeting of finance ministers in December, but that divisions now appeared to be so deep that chances for a deal had narrowed considerably.
""It is very difficult to see an agreement on the digital tax because so many technical issues are not solved yet,"" Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen said.
He added that the proposed EU tax was devised in a way that would hit mostly U.S. companies and therefore it would attract U.S. retaliation. 
The Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, who has for long opposed the tax fearing it could reduce revenues in Ireland, said the new levy would set a negative precedent for Europe, as it would be imposed in states where consumers are located rather than where services are produced. 

""We are net exporters. What kind of reaction would we have if this model was imposed on us?"" he told ministers.

The remarks come as Lilly gains access to fresh capital after it took its Elanco animal health unit public in September.
""We got a little bit less than $4 billion in the third quarter as a function of the first step of our Elanco divestiture and we'll put that money (to use) against our capital priorities,"" Lilly's Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley said in an interview.
""The Armo deal that we did earlier this year, we'll look to do more of those,"" Smiley said, but added that mergers with big drug companies were unlikely to be an important tool to grow in the future.
In May Lilly said it would buy Armo Biosciences Inc to expand its portfolio of drugs that helps the body's immune system fight cancer, a move that could pit the company against several rivals in a lucrative market.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft wants its Western oil buyers to accept new terms and pay penalties from 2019 if they fail to pay for supplies in the event that new U.S. sanctions on the Russian energy major disrupt its oil sales, according to trading sources and Rosneft's draft contracts.
The buyers - including some of the world's biggest oil companies and traders such as  BP  (L:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Total  (PA:TOTF), Vitol and Gunvor - are fiercely opposing the move, according to trading sources.
The stand-off is likely to force Rosneft to soften its demands, the sources said, adding that the development shows the extent to which the state-owned oil giant is concerned about widening U.S. sanctions on Russia.
""It is all very uncertain with the sanctions and Rosneft is clearly worried and is trying to minimize possible risks,"" said a trading source with a European major. ""We said no, we couldn't accept this,"" he added.
Rosneft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request comment. BP and Gunvor declined Reuters requests for comment. Shell, Total, Vitol did not respond to Reuters inquiries.
Russia has been under U.S. and EU sanctions since 2014 when it invaded Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. The sanctions have been repeatedly widened to include new companies and sectors, making it tough for Russian oil firms to borrow money abroad, raise new capital or develop Arctic and unconventional deposits.
President Vladimir Putin's administration has been hoping for a thaw in relations with the United States since President Donald Trump came to power but Washington has imposed new sanctions instead, including on some of Russia's richest people.
Russian businesses are preparing for a new wave of sanctions expected in the coming days and months. The firms are trying to diversify away from dollar payments and tapping Asia for more of their financing and technology needs.
Rosneft is run by a close ally of Putin, Igor Sechin. 
He and his company have been under sectoral sanctions since 2014. Rosneft has so far avoided being put on the Special Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which would make it impossible for major Western companies to have dealings with it.
When Washington put Russia's aluminum giant Rusal on the SDN list earlier this year, the move brought its metals exports to a near standstill and disrupted its access to raw materials from suppliers around the world.
STAND OFF
A Rosneft tender document seen by Reuters showed the company had asked its oil buyers to accept a new clause in its 2019 annual tender to sell oil products.
""No sanctions ... shall terminate or amend any obligations of the parties stated by the contract,"" the document said.
It also said that if a buyer walks away from the contract because of sanctions, it must compensate Rosneft with a payment that could either be a fixed amount or a sum calculated on the basis of the contract terms.
Currently Rosneft has relatively mild sanction clauses, which say that none of the parties has an obligation to abide by the contract if sanctions are imposed and no penalty is levied.
Rosneft is the world's largest listed oil firm with oil and gas output at around 5 million barrels per day. It produces over 4 percent of global oil - on par with Iran - and counts all the global oil majors among its buyers.
The buyers have insisted on sticking with the old clauses, according to five trading sources.
Rosneft has so far said that it could not guarantee to consider buyers' bids at tenders as valid unless they accept the new terms.

Rosneft will award its annual oil products supply tenders on Dec. 5, according to the tender documents, giving the companies more time to negotiate.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - The world's two largest planemakers signaled on Tuesday that they were keen to see an end to a bruising trade war between Washington and Beijing, as China opened its largest airshow with a display that showcased its aviation ambitions.
Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) made their comments on the opening day of the biennial Airshow China, being held in the coastal city of Zhuhai from Nov. 6-11, that is traditionally an event for Beijing to parade its growing aviation prowess.
China has become a key hunting ground for deals for foreign aviation firms thanks to surging travel demand, but the outlook has been complicated by Beijing's desire to grow its own champions in industries ranging from aviation to semiconductors to robots.
Its ties with the United States have in particular been strained. President Donald Trump criticizes China for what he sees as intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. business and a gaping trade deficit, while Beijing calls the complaints unreasonable. The two sides have resorted to tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars.
While U.S.-made aircraft, among America's biggest exports to China, have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs, analysts said they were still waiting to see what the trade war would spell for U.S. companies such as Boeing.
George Xu, the top China executive at Boeing's biggest rival Airbus (PA:AIR), said at a news conference that the European planemaker did not expect a sales windfall from the tensions.
""I am Chinese and we don't like this kind of trade war,"" he said. ""Nobody will be the winner in this kind of trade war.""
Airbus had hoped to close a deal for 184 aircraft during a trip to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January, but negotiations appear to have stalled, industry sources say.
In carefully worded comments, Boeing's senior vice-president of Northeast Asia sales, Rick Anderson, said China was a rapidly growing aviation market and that he believed Washington and Beijing understood that.
""We continue to engage with leaders of United States and China, and continue to urge productive conversation to resolve the trade discrepancies,"" he said.
""We are optimistic for a quick solution.""
AMBITIONS ON DISPLAY
China and United States have in recent days stoked optimism that a breakthrough might be made, after Trump spoke by phone with President Xi Jinping last week.
The two countries have also announced that they will hold a delayed top-level security dialogue on Friday.
Still, Beijing has shown little sign of taming its ambitions to catch up with rivals like the United States, France and Germany in high-end technology.
Projects being showcased in Zhuhai included a full-scale mock-up of a widebody CR929 jet being jointly developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) in hopes of eventually competing with Boeing's 787 and Airbus' A350 jets.
The global market for widebody jets is estimated to be worth $2.5 trillion over the next two decades, according to Boeing, with the fleet size more than doubling to 9,180 jets.
Widebodies account for around 20 percent of projected global jet deliveries over that period but almost 40 percent by value.
Hundreds of spectators and industry executives at the airshow were also treated to a roaring flight demonstration that involved three of China's Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters, which debuted at the show two years ago with a 60-second flypast.
China put the J-20 into service last year that experts say is a part of Beijing's plan to narrow a military technology gap with the United States and its F-35 stealth fighter.
Sophisticated anti-aircraft batteries were also on display.

""If you tie those together with the J-20, the message is about Anti-Area Access Denial. It is not just about protecting the motherland but pushing the Americans away,"" said aerospace analyst Sash Tusa of UK-based Agency Partners.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","European automakers BMW, Volvo to trial new LME steel contracts","By Maytaal Angel and Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - European automakers BMW and Volvo plan to experiment with steel contracts to be launched by the London Metal Exchange early next year, a move which could eventually change the way the industry hedges and prices contracts, industry sources said.
The LME is launching three hot rolled coil (HRC) steel futures covering Europe, North America and China early next year, and industry sources told Reuters automakers such as Volvo and BMW (DE:BMWG) were interested in using them.
Hot rolled coil (HRC) is a flat steel used to make cars and white goods and typically bought by consumers on annual fixed price contracts. The LME's cash-settled contract will be settled against an industry benchmark.
""During the first six months, merchants and traders will put volumes in to get liquidity going,"" a broking source said. ""If that works, manufacturing companies including BMW and Volvo will ask suppliers to make offers on the basis of LME prices for new, small contracts, see how it works.""
One source said BMW already uses iron ore derivatives as a proxy for hedging some of its steel costs, so could move with relative ease to trading the new LME contracts.
BMW said it is currently pursuing a ""hedging strategy"" and aims to ""increase planning reliability for the company"".
Volvo said: ""We continuously review our raw material strategies however no decisions have been taken on hedging.""
Automakers, alongside construction firms, banks, brokers, merchants and steel service centers, have traditionally been open to steel futures, while steelmakers have mostly been opposed, concerned about potential loss of pricing power.
Industry sources say automaker interest bodes well for the contracts, but they also stressed that new contracts usually take years to gain traction, adding that a lack of interest from steelmakers could slow the process.
""From what I've seen, first merchants get involved, then prop traders, then service centers or stockists. Eventually mills start offering steel on an index (linked price),"" said a source at an LME brokerage.
Sources involved in broking and looking at providing liquidity for the new contracts say they are talking to leading steelmakers about using the new contracts.
The LME already has contracts for steel scrap and for steel rebar , a type of construction steel. Volumes have been growing modestly since the contracts' 2015 launch.
Some 4.2 million tonnes of scrap and 500,000 tonnes of rebar have been traded on the LME in the year to date, versus 3 million tonnes of scrap and 644,000 tonnes of rebar traded last year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The LME, the world's oldest and largest metals marketplace, is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388).
Having lost some market share in recent years to the CME Group (O:CME) and Chinese Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), it is aiming to make inroads into steel, a global industry worth an annual $900 billion.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) recorded higher sales of its newer drugs Trulicity and Taltz in the third quarter, helping the diabetes specialist top Wall Street profit estimates and raise its yearly earnings target on Tuesday.
Shares of Lilly jumped 4 percent in premarket trading following the news.
Lilly is relying on new drugs to drive growth after it took its animal health unit public in September and as its older treatments face rising competition from generic as well as branded medicines.
Third-quarter sales from both diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis medicine Taltz exceeded Wall Street forecasts but revenue from Lilly's other newer treatments — Basaglar, Jardiance and Cyramza — each fell short of expectations.
""Performance of key products that are part of the new product story were mixed,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said.
Trulicity, which recently overtook Humalog as Lilly's top selling drug, had revenue of $816.2 million, above analysts' consensus estimate of $801 million, according to brokerage SunTrust.
On Monday Lilly announced that Trulicity significantly reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart-related death in a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes.
Results from that trial should strengthen, if not cement, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker's position as a leader in diabetes treatments, analysts said.
""Trulicity has become our largest medicine in terms of sales and certainly we were pleased with data released yesterday,"" Lilly's Chief Financial Officer Josh Smiley said in an interview.
""It reinforces how important the class is to the treatment of diabetes,"" he added.
Lilly raised its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.55 and $5.60 per share, from $5.40 to $5.50 per share.
Net income in the quarter ended September more than doubled to $1.15 billion. Results a year earlier included a write-down of more than $400 million.
Excluding one-time items, Lilly earned $1.39 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose about 7 percent to $6.06 billion, edging past analysts' expectations of $6.05 billion.

Lilly's shares were up 4.2 percent at $114.78 in premarket trading.

Net foreign outflows from Saudi Arabia were $1.7 billion, while most other markets had inflows, according to a report by Mohamad Al Hajj, a strategist at the research arm of EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. Total outflows from the region were $1.4 billion.
Volatility in the main Saudi stock gauge surged last month after Khashoggi’s murder at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul, and net sales by foreign investors were the highest since the local exchange started providing the data in 2015. Foreigners also exited Kuwait’s market, but at a much slower rate. By contrast, they were were net buyers in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, Al Hajj wrote.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Two years in, Trump holds stock market bragging rights","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has taken credit for the stock market's gains during his nearly two years in the White House, and those claims are reasonable given the impact of tax cuts and pro-business policies on investor sentiment. 
(GRAPHIC-The presidential touch: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jtEpzi))
The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent since Trump's election in November 2016 to the eve of congressional midterm elections on Tuesday. This surpasses the market's performance over the same time frame under any other president in the past 64 years. Under President Dwight Eisenhower, the S&P 500 rose 29 percent from his election in November 1952 through November 1954. 
Sweeping corporate tax cuts, an initiative driven by Trump, supercharged U.S. companies' earnings and helped lift the cash-rich technology sector. The Republican party last year passed the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, boosting U.S. corporate earnings. 
Still, other sectors that could have been expected to benefit strongly from a Trump presidency have lagged. Indeed, the individual stocks that have gained and lost the most during his reign have little discernable link to Trump's presidency. 
How the market shakes out in the final two years of Trump's presidency will probably be influenced by Tuesday's elections. Analysts expect pressure on stocks if Democrats gain control of the House of Representatives and a sharper downward reaction if they sweep the House and Senate. 
On the contrary, if Republicans hold their ground, stocks could gain further, with hopes of more tax reform ahead.
The following graphics show how the Trump presidency has played out on a macro and micro level: 
(GRAPHIC-Stock market performance in presidents' early years: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PeSaoM)
Trump's strong stock market record has been maintained even after a recent pullback on Wall Street as worries about trade battles, inflation and rising interest rates have increased caution among investors. Starting in 2010 under President Barack Obama as the world recovered from the financial crisis, the S&P 500 has enjoyed its longest bull market in history.
With more than half of Trump's presidency still to come, how the market will perform over his whole term is unknown. Democratic President Bill Clinton saw the S&P 500 triple during his two terms in the White House. (See graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2jtEpzi)
Average S&P 500 company earnings per share are on track to rise 24 percent this year, the strongest annual gain in eight years, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Investor confidence stemming from the tax cuts and Trump's other business-friendly policies so far have more than made up for ongoing worries on Wall Street that his trade conflict with China is hurting the U.S. economy, and that it could become worse.
The tax cuts also led Apple (O:AAPL) and other multinationals in the technology sector to repatriate billions of dollars in profits held overseas, some of which went toward buying back stock and sending Wall Street higher. 
The S&P 500 information technology index (SPLRCT) has gained 51 percent since Trump's election. Financials (SPSY), which benefited from Trump's deregulation of the banking industry, have climbed 34 percent since Nov 8, 2016.
(GRAPHIC-Sectors under Trump: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Peaf68)
Still, some companies that had been expected to boom under Trump have fared poorly. The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) is flat since Trump's election, even though crude prices (LCOc1) rose over 50 percent during that time and despite Trump putting the brakes on Obama-era policies aimed at reducing the country's reliance on oil. 
(GRAPHIC-Industry groups under Trump:https://tmsnrt.rs/2PewkS6 )
Semiconductors have fared better than any other industry group, even though they are highly exposed to China and could become casualties in Trump's trade war with Beijing. 
Along with telecommunications, food and tobacco companies, automakers on average have fared worst among 27 industry group's since Trump's election. General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have been wrestling for years with tepid global demand, with recent signs of a deep slowdown in China.
Industry groups are more detailed categories than the 11 sectors widely tracked on the stock market. 
(GRAPHIC-Top and bottom stocks under Trump: https://tmsnrt.rs/2P9MrR7)
Interest rates, economic growth, company earnings and inflation are widely viewed as strong influences on stock prices, making who holds power in Washington just one of many factors affecting investor sentiment.
Abiomed Inc (O:ABMD), the S&P 500's top performer since Trump's election, has jumped over 260 percent, helped in part by the success of its Impella heart pumps. 

General Electric's (N:GE) 68 percent loss makes it the S&P 500's worst performer since Trump was elected. The former industrial powerhouse has foundered in several key markets in recent years and is aggressively cutting costs and selling businesses.

Adjusted for one-time items, it reported earnings per share of 11 cents, down from 27 cents a year ago, but above Wall Street's average estimate of 3 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The news and information provider reported a 3 percent rise in quarterly revenue, excluding the effects of exchange rates, to $1.29 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.32 billion, on average.
""Our year-to-date performance strengthens our confidence that we are on track to deliver a solid year and an even better 2019,"" Chief Executive Jim Smith said in a statement.
The earnings decline reflected lower operating profit and higher income tax expense from the company's continuing operations, offsetting higher earnings from its discontinued operations.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 06:16AM ET</span>","Ford goes local in India, aims for bigger slice of competitive market","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co made a profit in India for the first time in a decade in the last fiscal year, signaling that a strategy conceived two years ago by the U.S. car manufacturer for one of the world's most competitive car markets is starting to show some success.
Under an initiative called the Emerging Market Operating Model (EMOM), Ford cut manufacturing costs by 40 percent and is developing more vehicles locally as it moves away from its ""One Ford"" plan, which restricted its ability to be cost-competitive and agile in a fast-growing market, Ford executives and industry sources told Reuters. 
""EMOM is the North Star for the turnaround at Ford in India,"" Anurag Mehrotra, managing director of Ford's India unit, said in an interview.
It's early days yet, and Ford still accounts for less than 3 percent of total passenger vehicle sales in India, where analysts say it's tough for auto manufacturers to make money.
""They are still a long way away till they can call India a successful market,"" said Kaushik Madhavan, vice president, mobility at consultant Frost & Sullivan.
A key factor for Ford India will be how it leverages its partnership with local automaker Mahindra & Mahindra, he said.
As part of EMOM, Ford is deepening ties with Mahindra to build passenger vehicles in India, which could also involve sales in other emerging markets. 
Over the past two decades, Ford has invested $2 billion in India, which has become a major growth area for car manufacturers. Car sales rose 8 percent to 3.3 million last year and India is set to become the world's third-largest market by 2020 with sales of over 5 million cars, according to consultant IHS Markit. 
But global car companies have mostly struggled to woo India's cost-conscious buyers and are now under pressure from investors to focus on profitable markets and technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles.
The success of India's top carmaker Maruti Suzuki, a unit of Suzuki Motor Corp which sells one in every two cars in the country, has been built on having a wide range of products, low prices, a vast dealership network and an autonomous local team that can quickly react to market changes.
Its nearest competitor is Hyundai Motor Co with a 17 percent market share, which has had better success than some of its American and European rivals like General Motors (NYSE:GM), Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG.
Ford is at a considerable distance from the leaders in the market, but sold more than 90,000 vehicles in the last fiscal year and exported twice the number. Two years ago, Ford's annual sales in India were less than 80,000 and it exported about 110,000 vehicles, industry data showed.
MORE AUTONOMY
Western carmakers have not come close to Japan's Suzuki and South Korea's Hyundai because they have failed to tweak their global products and strategy to suit a frugal market like India, and their local teams often lack autonomy, industry sources say.
Ford's new strategy gives greater autonomy to the local management team, and will contribute to a global restructuring plan to save $11 billion over the next few years by cutting costs, forming partnerships and investing in new technologies. 
The strategy already seems to be giving Ford a cautious beginning to better sales in India. 
Ford India made a profit of 5.26 billion rupees ($72 million) in the fiscal year that ended on March 31 compared with a loss of 5.21 billion rupees a year ago, according to a regulatory filing.
In contrast, General Motors decided to cut its losses and stopped selling cars in India last year while Volkswagen took a backseat, handing over strategy for the country to its sister-company Skoda. 
Ford's top Asia and India executives came up with EMOM during a week-long strategy meeting in Shanghai in late 2016 and picked India as a testbed. The strategy has not formally been taken to other markets yet. 
""We realized we need to have a sustainable and profitable business in India,"" said Mehrotra, adding that Ford looked at its brand, products, cost and scale to improve efficiency.
For instance, in its Figo hatchback that sells for as little as 600,000 rupees ($8,200), Ford used imported floormats that cost more than locally sourced ones. During a review under EMOM it learned that buyers don't really want imported mats, he said.
It reduced logistics costs by 20 percent by switching to rail freight instead of roads, and increased the use of locally sourced components in its cars to more than 85 percent from about 60-70 percent.
CUTTING COSTS
Ford officials also said the company has developed a low-cost dealership format which is smaller in size and has fewer cars on display. It costs half of the 50-60 million rupees Ford usually spends on things like showroom inventory, spare parts and the sales force when setting up a dealership.
In the last 18 months it has opened more than 100 such dealerships, especially in smaller towns and cities to further its reach, Mehrotra said.
It would earlier cost Ford about three times the amount a domestic carmaker would spend on a product upgrade because Ford India needs to pay a fee, or royalty, to the parent, said a source aware of the changes.
Under EMOM, Ford India will develop more products in-house, making it more responsive to market changes and reducing the royalty fee, which will boost profits, the source said.
""One Ford doesn't work anymore,"" said the source, alluding to a global product strategy devised by former CEO Alan Mulally. ""It will be there in spirit, but it will not be implemented the same way as it was two years ago.""
Ford last year formed an alliance with SUV and truck-maker Mahindra to co-develop vehicles, including electric cars, share powertrains and work on new technologies.
The carmaker made a similar strategy shift in China, giving up on its ""One Ford"" model and working with local, low-cost carmakers to come up with more competitive mainstream cars and boost sales.
Ford and Mahindra are co-developing two platforms and the first car on it is likely be launched in 2020, two sources said, adding that Ford is using Mahindra as a benchmark to bring down supplier costs in the region.
Mahindra is also the only commercial electric vehicle manufacturer in India, and Ford would benefit from getting access to its low-cost technology to build electric cars. Mahindra is already working on an electric prototype of Ford's compact sedan Aspire, the sources said. 
""We're certainly concentrating on India right now, but there's all kinds of opportunity beyond India together should we both want to explore that,"" Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of global operations, told Reuters in an interview in September.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",'Ballers' star Rob Corddry had no Plan B if show business failed,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If sarcasm were a drug, Rob Corddry would be one of the entertainment world's biggest dealers.
TV viewers first encountered Corddry’s biting wit when he signed on as a correspondent on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” riffing with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. He has since gone on to big-screen hits like “Hot Tub Time Machine,” and currently stars on HBO’s “Ballers” with Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock).
When the cameras are off, Corddry’s high-grade cynicism turns into something more earnest. For the latest in Reuters’ Life Lessons series, he talked about the fearlessness and focus that helped him achieve success in Hollywood.
Q: Since you and your brother Nate are both in the comedy business, did you get that sense of humor from your parents?
A: Mainly it came from growing up in Boston. When you spend eight months of the year in freezing cold weather, it tends to make you pretty sarcastic and cynical. But I remember our family meals together, the late afternoon Sunday suppers, were always very funny – usually at someone else’s expense.
Q: I understand you were a Scout growing up, something most people might not have predicted.
A: More than anything that taught me self-reliance. I don’t get lost in the woods. Plus it gave me a great appreciation for the outdoors: Walking in the woods has a way of quieting all distractions and clearing your mind. The more remote the location, the faster the track to wisdom.
Q: Starting out in show business, did you have some lean times?
A: Very much so. I had a lot of weird jobs in New York, but with my last one before acting I was making a pretty good living: I was assistant to the assistant of the general counsel for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
My trick was that I would only work exactly a year at each of these jobs, and then I would get myself fired, so I could collect unemployment and look for acting gigs. At Goldman Sachs, my boss was very proper, and one day when I knew he was looking at me, I put my feet up on the desk. That day I got home, and they called and said I was fired. 
Q: Did you have a financial plan if show business didn’t work out?
A: I always believed that if I did what I loved, the money would come, and luckily it turned out to be true. I had no Plan B. I was only going to be an actor or a writer – that was it for me. You kind of have to put blinders on, in terms of achieving success.
Q: Do you and your wife Sandra make a good money team?
A: We are very different people. I’m an artist type with my head in the clouds. I can barely remember what happened to me this morning. But she is a very practical person with common sense to burn. So we balance each other out nicely, in terms of thinking about what to spend money on.
Q: Your current co-star on HBO’s “Ballers” is The Rock, so do you guys swap success tips?
A: We usually talk about parenting. He has a couple of kids, and I have two kids age 12 and 9, so basically it’s just two dudes talking shop about how to be a good dad. 
Q: How do you and your wife allocate your charitable time and money?
A: We don’t attach ourselves to just one thing, because we don’t want our giving to feel like it’s just about us. But generally our focus is on women’s causes, human trafficking and literacy. Thanks to Stephen Colbert I have become a big fan of Donors Choose, where if a school somewhere needs books, you can just go online and chip in. I have become really enamored with that idea.
Q: What lessons do you try to pass along to your kids?
A: One good tidbit was from my late Aunt Doris, who was married to my Uncle Bill for a million years. We asked her the secret to a long, happy marriage, and she shrugged and said, ‘Just be kind to each other.’ It’s that easy – not just marriage, but everything in life. Just be kind.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares dipped on Tuesday as investors punished companies like Zalando and  Pandora  that missed expectations, while caution prevailed ahead of U.S. mid-term elections.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) dipped 0.1 percent while the euro zone's leading index (STOXX50E) fell 0.3 percent.
While politics dented Italian stocks, company results dominated the wider market, with some poor showings hitting shares.
Zalando (DE:ZALG) shares tumbled 7.4 percent after Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer reported its slowest rate of sales growth since it was launched a decade ago, and recorded a loss due in part to unseasonably warm weather.
""The shift to mobile, fast fashion and beauty is driving down basket size, competition is putting pressure on gross margin, and Zalando's build out of distribution centers across Europe whilst transport costs are increasing has put upward pressure on the fulfilment cost ratio,"" wrote Berenberg analysts.
Pandora (CO:PNDORA) fell 4.2 percent after the Danish jewelry maker slashed its 2018 sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter, saying it would review its strategy and launch a new cost-cutting program.
Shares in Austrian engineering group Andritz (VI:ANDR) fell 5.2 percent after it missed third-quarter operating profit forecasts due to higher costs at its metals unit and lower earnings at its hydro operations.
Many companies this earnings season have flagged a squeeze on margins from rising commodity and wage costs.
Worries over Italy's budget also weighed, and Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) lagged, down 0.8 percent.
Bank stocks (FTIT8300) fell 1.4 percent as government bond yields rose after euro zone finance ministers called on Italy to change its budget at a Eurogroup meeting on Monday.
Euro zone business growth slumped to a two-year low in October as growing trade tensions and tariffs, alongside rising political uncertainty, put a dent in exports and optimism, the euro zone PMI services survey for October showed.
Overall earnings expectations are holding firm despite weaker economic data.
""We think there's a lot of potential that might be unlocked on the European side but unfortunately there are some idiosyncratic stories that have slowed down the potential for European equities,"" said Monica Defend, chief strategist and deputy head of group research at Amundi.
More encouraging results gave a boost to some.
Staffing firm  Adecco  (S:ADEN) rose 4.4 percent after its results met expectations and margins were stronger, with analysts saying the shares had been pricing in much of the euro area's slowing economy.
Spanish wind turbine maker Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) surged 10.2 percent after reporting strong order intake. 
Danish peer  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) also climbed 3.1 percent.
 Morphosys  (DE:MORG) shares jumped 7.2 percent after it forecast revenues at the upper end of its guided range.

Postal and logistics firm  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) gained 1.9 percent after its profit decline was less steep than analysts had expected.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 04:59AM ET</span>","Stocks, dollar hunker down for U.S. midterm elections","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares ticked lower and the dollar and bond markets barely budged on Tuesday, as traders braced for midterm elections in the United States and some potentially lively sessions ahead.
Japan (T) and Hong Kong had helped Asia overcome another Chinese wobble (SS), but Europe (EU) slipped into the red early on as investors pounced on some corporate earnings misses and pre-U.S. midterms caution took hold.
The elections mark the first major test of President Donald Trump's sweeping tax cuts and hostile trade policies. Polls point to his Republican party losing control of the House of Representatives which could curb some of his policymaking power.
The dollar dipped against the euro (EUR=) and sterling , but made up ground on the Japanese yen  as dealers kept their options open after the U.S. currency's bumper year so far.
""It is definitely not the time to buy the dip,"" said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner, referring to U.S. and globally-focused stock markets and risk assets.
""Everything that could go well for U.S. consumers in the last couple of years has gone well, but now the tide is turning... At the moment you are running out of drivers of growth in the U.S.""
Italian (FTMIB) and Spanish (IBEX) stocks weakened as updated PMI figures confirmed euro zone business growth had fallen to a two-year low last month against the backdrop of trade tensions.
The future output index caused even more concern as it fell to a near four-year low of 60.5 from 62.1.
""Euro zone companies reported a disappointing start to the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiles the data.
Italian government bond yields were also pushing up after euro zone finance ministers called on Rome to change its budget at a meeting on Monday.
That had done little to ease the standoff between Italy and the European Union over the spending plan. With Rome not likely to bow to the demands any time soon it reignited concerns about a further escalation in the feud. 
OIL SPILL
In Asian trading, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) edged up 0.4 percent following a positive finish for Wall Street on Monday.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) also climbed 1.1 percent though weaker Chinese markets and regional technology shares capped the region. 
Apple (O:AAPL) suppliers such as Taiwan's  Hon Hai  Precision Industry (TW:2317) were hit by a report that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report had also driven Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade.
While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump's pro-business agenda and raise concerns about U.S. political instability, some analysts say this may have already been priced in by investors.
The Cboe Skew index (SKEWX), also known as the ""black swan"" index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid. 
A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety. 
""Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. ""So it's unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions."" 
Gold was little changed but in oil markets crude prices were near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to continue buying oil from Iran temporarily, easing the likelihood of a sharp supply drop. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) slipped 0.3 percent to $62.89 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday's 2-1/2-month low of $72.16. 

Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) blocked about 115 user accounts after U.S. authorities tipped it off to suspicious behavior that may be linked to a foreign entity, the company said in a blog post on Monday, hours before U.S. voters head to the polls.
The social network said it needed to do further analysis to decide if the accounts are linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency or another group. The United States has accused the Russian government body of meddling in U.S. politics with social media posts meant to spread misinformation and sow discord.
Eighty-five of the removed accounts were posting in English on Facebook's Instagram service, and 30 more were on Facebook and associated with pages in French and Russian, the post said.
Some accounts ""were focused on celebrities"" and others on ""political debate,"" it added.
The tip came from U.S. law enforcement on Sunday night, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in the post.
The company announced its actions earlier in its investigation than typical ""given that we are only one day away from important elections in the U.S.,"" he added.
This year's contest has been portrayed as crucial by both Republicans and Democrats because both chambers of Congress, and the accompanying ability to pass or reject President Donald Trump's agenda, are up for grabs. 
""Americans should be aware that foreign actors, and Russia in particular, continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord,"" including through social media, federal authorities said in a statement on Monday.
Social media companies say they are now more vigilant against foreign and other potential election interference after finding themselves unprepared to tackle such activity in the U.S. presidential election two years ago.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2018 01:55AM ET</span>",Apple's Asia suppliers fall on report iPhone XR production boost canceled,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Asian supplier and assembler stocks fell on Tuesday on a media report that the iPhone maker had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new iPhone XR.
Taiwan-based assembler  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938) fell 5 percent and rival  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) dropped 3.6 percent. Apple is widely considered the biggest customer for Foxconn.
Apple shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday after the report by the Nikkei financial daily, which fueled concerns that the iPhone XR - the cheapest of three iPhones unveiled in September - was facing weak demand just days after it went on sale.
The Nikkei, citing supply chain sources, said Apple had also asked smaller iPhone assembler  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231) to stand by for rush orders, but the firm would receive no planned orders for the iPhone XR this season.
Wistron shares were down 0.8 percent on Tuesday.
""Foxconn's proportion of orders is bigger than Pegatron's with a ratio of about 6 to 4. Wistron doesn't have as many orders as the two, so the impact won't be so big there,"" said Nicole Tu, analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting in Taipei.
Apple began shipping the iPhone XR on Oct 26 after two weeks of pre orders. The company had released the higher priced iPhone XS and XS Max more than a month earlier.
On Apple's post-earnings call last week, Chief Executive Tim Cook said he had very little sales data for the iPhone XR, but the other two models had got off to a ""really great start.""
Apple said sales for the usually busy holiday period would likely miss analyst expectations as sales in emerging markets including India were weak.
Demand concerns have weighed on Apple's stock in the past few sessions, pushing its market value below $1 trillion.
On Tuesday, shares in other Taiwan-based Apple suppliers fell sharply as well. 
 Flexium  Interconnect Inc (TW:6269) and camera lens-maker Largan Precision Co Ltd (TW:3008) were both down more than 6 percent. The Taiwan Weighted Index (TWII) was down around 0.7 percent.
Among other Apple suppliers in the region, Hong Kong-based acoustic components maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018) fell over 6 percent.
South Korean electronic parts suppliers Samsung (KS:005930) Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd (KS:009150) and  LG Innotek Co Ltd  (KS:011070) were down more than 7 percent.

Apple on Monday did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron declined to comment.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Luckin Coffee, an up-and-coming coffee chain with ambitions to challenge  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) in China, is targeting a valuation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion as it launches a new round of funding, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The fundraising comes as Luckin expands at breakneck speed across China. The firm only officially launched in January and yet has already opened over 1,400 cafes in 21 cities under a supercharged growth plan based on cheap delivery and online ordering.
It has financed its expansion with funding from investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL]. In July, Luckin said it closed a $200 million investment round bringing its valuation to $1 billion. That made it one of the fastest companies in China to reach unicorn status.
In the new round of talks with prospective investors, Luckin plans to raise $200 million to $300 million in fresh equity, said one of the people familiar with the matter, who all declined to be identified as the information was not public.
As the deal terms are still subject to change, the amount could fall within the $100 million to $200 million range, said a second person.
Luckin has also begun early-stage discussion with investment banks regarding an overseas initial public offering (IPO), most likely in Hong Kong or New York, two of the people said. 
Luckin declined to comment on financing or IPO plans.
The coffee chain and its investors aim to challenge the dominance of Starbucks, which has over 3,400 stores in China - its second-biggest market after the United States. In some media, Luckin has touted itself as China's home-grown answer to its world-famous rival.
The firm has distinguished itself with aggressive marketing, an emphasis on delivery and a tech-centric purchasing experience. For instance, customers must place orders using Luckin's app, through which they can then view a livestream of their coffee being made.
In May, Starbucks said it aimed to roughly double its China store count to 6,000 by 2022. In August, it announced a coffee delivery partnership with e-commerce firm  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd (N:BABA).

The following month, Luckin revealed it had formed its own partnership with Alibaba's tech rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700).

420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>","China, Russia unveil life-size model of planned widebody jet at Zhuhai airshow","ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China and Russia on Tuesday unveiled a life-size model of a proposed wide-body long-haul jet at the opening of China's largest airshow, giving public shape to their joint efforts to break into a market dominated by Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR).
The biennial Airshow China, being held in the coastal city of Zhuhai from Nov. 6-11, is traditionally an event for Beijing to parade its growing aviation prowess but comes as the country is dealing with a bruising trade war with the United States.
The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) showed off the model of the CR929's cockpit and passenger cabin in a ceremony that was attended by senior executives from both state-owned planemakers. 
""Our program is making progress and is on schedule,"" said UAC President Yury Slyusar. ""It is currently in the preliminary design phase and we are also in the supplier and equipment selection phase, which will finish by the end of 2019.""
The mockup, which was 22 meters long, 6.5 meters tall and 5.9 meters wide, showed a roomy interior with 9-abreast basic seating in economy class. 
The cockpit contained dummy instruments, with actual systems yet to be chosen, including a sidestick similar to the flying control favored by Airbus over the traditional control column. 
""It is more Airbus than Boeing,"" a senior Western aerospace executive said.
UAC and COMAC announced they would cooperate on a widebody jet program in 2014 and they kick-started full-scale development of the program three years later by forming joint venture China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation (CRAIC).
To date, they have already sought proposals for the plane's engine and landing gear. 
Chen Yingchun, COMAC's chief designer for the CR929 program, told reporters that CRAIC would seek supplier proposals from all over the world but declined to comment on whether current trade frictions with the United States would influence their choice.
The jet's designers have previously said its fuselage would be designed and made by China while the wings would be designed by Russia. Beijing wants the single-aisle aircraft to eventually compete with the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787.

A senior COMAC executive said in June that the CR929 aims to make its maiden flight from 2023.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",EU business lobby says Xi's reform pledges fall short,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Reform commitments made by Chinese President Xi Jinping in a key speech this week failed to go far enough, a top European business lobby said, calling for concrete action and timetables for opening up the world's second largest economy. 
Xi promised on Monday to lower tariffs, broaden market access and import more from overseas at the start of a trade expo in Shanghai designed to demonstrate goodwill amid mounting frictions with the United States and others.
While Xi said China would accelerate opening of the education, telecommunications and cultural sectors, among others, and step up enforcement of intellectual property rights, his remarks largely echoed previous pledges. 
Xi's speech did ""not go as far as is necessary"", the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement late on Monday.
The chamber applauded Xi's promise to remove caps on foreign investment in education and medical services sectors, and his aim to speed up talks on a China-EU investment treaty.
""That said, European business had higher hopes for what had been marketed by the Chinese government as a milestone event,"" the chamber said.
""This constant repetition, without sufficient concrete measures or timelines being introduced, has left the European business community increasingly desensitised to these kinds of promises,"" it said.
The chamber also said that businesses were ""disenchanted"" with Chinese free trade zones, which Xi committed to expand, calling them a ""timid approach to reform that is unaligned with China's economic weight and maturity"".
""China should focus on opening up new sectors of its economy to foreign investment, not 'piloting' reforms in areas that are ringfenced from the rest of the country,"" it said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has railed against China for what he sees as intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. business and a gaping trade deficit.
The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods so far, and China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. Trump has said that if a deal is not made, he could impose tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese imports into the United States.

The European Union, which shares U.S. concerns over China's trade practices if not Trump's tariff strategy, has called on China to take concrete steps to further open its market to foreign firms and provide a level playing field.

The company was forced Monday to derail the train that traveled about 90 kilometers without a driver across the Pilbara, a major iron ore producing area in Western Australia. All train operations remain suspended while investigations continue into the cause of the incident, according to the company.
BHP’s iron ore mine operations are unaffected by the incident, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday. “The only thing that’s been suspended is our trains.”
Stockpiles at Port Hedland will be used over the coming days to maintain port operations, BHP said in a statement. The company, which runs trains that are almost 3 kilometers long from its giant iron ore mines, said it’s working with local authorities to investigate the incident. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.
“At this stage we anticipate the recovery process to take about one week,” the company said.
Iron ore producers in Western Australia run some of the world’s longest trains. BHP transports material from its large mines -- which make up almost 40 percent of its profits -- to Port Hedland, where it ships to customers in China and Japan. The company has more than 1,000 kilometers of rail infrastructure in the ore-rich Pilbara region.
BHP shares rose as much as 1.9 percent in Sydney trading."

428,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Evergrande Naysayers Should Tread Carefully,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Real estate price growth is slowing and bond defaults are rising, but this isn’t the time to short China’s big property companies.
China Evergrande Group, the short sellers’ favorite punt until they were burned by a rebound, is now back in their sights. The developer’s shares are down 37 percent from an October 2017 peak, and its dollar bonds are just coming off record lows. But a groaning debt load doesn’t tell the whole story.
Chinese residential sales grew 11 percent in September year-on-year, a marked slowdown from 17.8 percent in August and July’s 24.8 percent. Add a tougher funding climate and a slowing economy, and you’ve got plenty of real estate companies, the heart of the nation’s private sector, strapped for cash.
Wagers against Evergrande are down from a peak of 27 percent of the float, but they remain high at 18.8 percent. A “rescued” bond sale, with Chairman Hui Ka Yan putting $1 billion of his own money into a $1.8 billion issue (despite very high interest rates), did nothing to allay concern that the firm will struggle to pay debt, almost half of which is coming due in the next 12 to 18 months.
Evergrande’s two-year wait for Chinese regulatory approval for a backdoor listing, and reports that it’s offering a Hong Kong office tower as collateral to raise $1.5 billion, have convinced investors the company is in dire funding straits. Evergrande was singled out by the People’s Bank of China, alongside HNA Group Co., Fosun International Ltd. and Tomorrow Holding Co., as a private entity that represents a potential systemic risk.
Don’t forget, though, that the investor graveyard is littered with punters against Evergrande.
The firm has managed to reduce debt levels, and that $1.8 billion bond sale was aimed at repaying old obligations, not creating new ones. Following record earnings, Evergrande’s net leverage fell to 127 percent at the end of June, from 184 percent at the end of 2017. Hui stuck to a pledge to bring the ratio down to 70 percent by the end of 2020.
Besides, Hui is sitting pretty with a 78 percent holding in the company. Evergrande’s record first-half dividend swelled his cash pile. 
Last week’s bond sale — in which all three tranches offered much higher rates than the average 8.1 percent Evergrande had to pay late last year — looks like a smart investment. Repeating the 2017 strategy of stock buybacks to burn shorts would have offered a dividend yield of just 6.6 percent. (Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. Chairman Joseph Lau, an ally in the buybacks, purchased another 9.6 million shares at HK$28.81 each on Aug. 23, raising his holding to 9 percent of Evergrande.)
Perhaps the best news for Evergrande is that President Xi Jinping has indicated an end to painful price curbs. While nobody expected the government to allow such an important sector to collapse, last week’s meeting of the Politburo showed a toned-down stance on real estate tightening, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts. By comparison, a July session of the top decision-making body agreed on “resolutely preventing home prices from rising.” Analysts at OCBC Investment Research say “conspicuously absent” references to lower prices suggest the government could reduce mortgage rates or relax price caps in some cities. 
That’s not to say China’s property bubble won’t lose some air, with price growth continuing to slow. But demand remains solid, and it may be buttressed by easier credit after Beijing’s less aggressive position. Even the PBOC view that Evergrande is too big to fail can be taken as a positive. Evergrande doomsayers need to wake up.

Recurring net income, which excludes one-time items, came in at 685 million reais ($184 million) in the third quarter versus 759 million reais ($204 million) a year earlier.
In a securities filing, BTG said trading gains decreased 77 percent from a year earlier due to ""challenging market conditions marked by risk aversion and low volumes.""
Lower trading gains offset higher revenues in BTG's other businesses, such as asset management, corporate lending and proprietary investments.
The bank said its investment in Petrobras Africa reported an equity pick-up. Last week, Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA, BTG's partner in Petrobras Africa, said it will sell its 50 percent stake in the company to a consortium led by top oil trader Vitol for $1.53 billion.
BTG's expanded loan book remained almost flat in the quarter, at 32.9 billion reais, although management told analysts in August that leverage should slowly go up.
The Sao Paulo-based bank reported an annualized return on equity, a measure of profitability, of 14.3 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from the previous quarter.
Management will discuss results in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) wants to hire thousands of seasonal delivery drivers to supplement services provided by the U.S. Post Office,  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and its own delivery partners, the company said on Monday.
The move comes as the online retailer is also recruiting new delivery service partners, or DSPs, to help reduce delivery costs that more than tripled to $21.7 billion between 2013 and 2017.
Amazon and its DSP owners are competing for workers in the tightest U.S. labor market in decades. UPS and FedEx combined plan to hire more than 150,000 temporary holiday workers. Along with some Amazon DSPs, they are offering bonuses for attendance, safety and customer service. 
Amazon is hiring across the United States and will provide vans for the seasonal workers, a company spokeswoman said. 
Advertisements on the job listing site Indeed.com offered pay roughly in line with market rates of $16.25 per hour in El Monte, California, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles; $15.50 per hour in Gary, Indiana; and $18.25 in the Long Island hamlet of Bethpage, New York. 
Drivers will work four, 10-hour shifts per week, according to the job listings.
Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix, which sells technology that tracks and manages deliveries, expects Amazon to send 8.5 million to 9 million packages per day during the peak season that runs from the end of November through Christmas.
He said the final result could be on the high end of that forecast because Amazon also said on Monday it would temporarily waive a $25 minimum purchase requirement to qualify for free holiday shipping.

That promotion, which promises to intensify competition with rivals such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT), could help Amazon reduce shipping costs since it does not come with a guarantee for pricey one- or two-day delivery, Jindel said.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",Toxin in U.S. corn harvest poses latest headache for farmers,"By Tom Polansek and Michael Hirtzer
CHICAGO (Reuters) - North American farmers are finding increased levels of a plant toxin known as vomitoxin in this year's corn harvest, adding insult to injury for growers already suffering as the U.S.-China trade war hurts soybean exports and crop prices.
Vomitoxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill, and grain buyers can reject cargoes or fine farmers for shipments that contain it. 
More cases than normal are likely in the corn crop because wet weather this autumn caused the fungus to develop while delaying harvests, Iowa State University grain quality expert Charles Hurburgh said on Monday. 
About three-fourths of U.S. corn is used domestically to feed livestock and make ethanol and a byproduct called distillers' dried grains that is fed to animals. However, livestock and ethanol producers need to blend corn that contains vomitoxin with corn that does not to make it suitable for feed when toxin levels are high.
""Hogs don't like the taste and don't like the smell. They will literally starve to death before eating it,"" said Indiana grain inspector Doug Titus of Titus Grain Inspection, whose company has labs at Andersons Inc, a crop handler, and energy company  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) sites.
The quality worries come as U.S. farm income has plunged by half over the past five years and as the deepening trade war harms demand for soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export product to China, and one frequently rotated with corn.
WH Group Ltd's Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL], the world's biggest pork producer, has detected vomitoxin in corn in Iowa and Nebraska, where it is not normally a problem, a source with knowledge of the situation said.
The company, which feeds corn to hogs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to one part per million (ppm) in human and pet foods and recommends levels under five ppm in grain for hogs, 10 ppm for chickens and dairy cattle. Beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to 30 ppm.
Ohio-based Andersons is warning farmers delivering corn to an ethanol plant in Albion, Michigan, that corn with vomitoxin levels above five ppm is subject to rejection.
Ethanol plants in Michigan and Ohio are also testing corn deliveries for the toxin and charging farmers financial penalties if their loads contain too much, a grain dealer in Michigan said.
In upstate New York, farmers are feeding dairy cattle with millfeeds, a byproduct of wheat flour milling, instead of contaminated corn, according to a feed broker in upstate New York. Prices for millfeeds rose about $5 per ton to $100 per ton for trucks in Buffalo, New York, on Monday.
Problems stretched over the border into Canada, too. 
""I'm already getting the panic button pushed in Canada in Ontario,"" said Max Hawkins, a nutritionist with Alltech Inc, a Kentucky-based feed supplement company.
Alltech had tested 45 samples of this year's U.S. corn harvest as of Friday and found 80 percent contained vomitoxin, Hawkins said. That is about average, Hawkins said, but he expected further testing to reveal bigger problems.
    More samples have not been examined yet because of the rains that delayed harvesting, which was 76 percent complete as of Sunday.

""It’s going to get worse,"" Hawkins said.

Marriott's shares fell 4.4 percent, overshadowing a higher-than-expected third quarter profit.
Marriott, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, forecast revenue per available room (revPAR) to rise 2 percent across the world in the fourth quarter. It had earlier forecast growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent.
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company also said it now expects 3 percent growth in full-year revPAR worldwide, at the low end of its earlier forecast of a rise of 3 percent to 4 percent.
Smaller rival  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) last month indicated a slowdown in its business by cutting the top end of its full-year revPAR growth target against the backdrop of growing international trade worries.
Additionally, there are concerns that the hotel industry, which has gained from a strong economy and robust travel demand, may be set to decelerate.
Marriott's net income dropped to $483 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $485 million.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.70 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.31, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's revenue fell about 1 percent to $5.05 billion, missing estimates of $5.37 billion.

While fewer people booked Marriott rooms across the world in the quarter, the average room rate rose 2.2 percent.

Stronger-than-expected earnings have pushed the estimate for third-quarter growth to 27.4 percent, based on results from 381 of the S&P 500 companies and estimates for the rest.
The growth estimate is well above the 21.6 percent growth for the quarter forecast by analysts on Oct. 1, and it would surpass the first quarter's 26.6 percent growth and the second quarter's 24.9 percent growth, based on Refinitiv data.
The last time quarterly profit growth was higher was in the fourth quarter of 2010, when it was 37.2 percent.
Strong profit growth this year has been fueled in part by the sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress late last year. But investors have been concerned about rising tariff and other costs for companies that could result in a bigger step down in profit growth next year than analysts are expecting.
Profit growth is expected to slow to 9 percent next year from an estimated 23.9 percent this year, according to Refinitiv data.

1. Midterms in Focus: Democrats to Regain Control of the House?
US voters take to the polls Tuesday, with pollsters indicating Democrats will likely regain control of the House, while Republicans will likely keep their slender advantage in the Senate.
While a divided Congress could prove somewhat of a hinderance to Trump's pro-business agenda, widely viewed as a boon for markets, analysts stressed that U.S. economic growth will likely continue.
A Democratic sweep could bring meaningful healthcare legislation, while a Republican sweep could extend last year's fiscal stimulus, Goldman Sachs said.
""(Both) these scenarios won't materially alter the trajectory of US growth. That said, however, they could trigger large responses from policy-sensitive stocks including high-tax firms and Pharma companies, the bank added.
Election exit polls are expected to be released at 17:00 ET; with final results expected late in the night, according to Briefing.com.
2. API Crude Stockpiles Data Eyed
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday after data last week showed a build in crude inventories for the second-straight week.
The American Petroleum Institute report comes a day of the Energy Information Administration petroleum report due Wednesday, which analysts have said, together with the loss of Iranian crude supplies, could determine the extend of any possible rally in oil prices.
The sustainability of any rally will depend on hard facts showing how the sanctions were affecting global oil supplies, along with other key data like weekly U.S. crude stockpiles, said Adam Sarhan, CEO and founder of New York-based global capital markets fund 50 Park Investments.
Crude oil futures fell 4 cents to settle at $63.10 on Monday.
3. Job Openings Expected to Decline
With limited top-tier economic data on tap for Tuesday, U.S. job openings data will likely garner the bulk of investor attention.
The JOLTs job openings data are scheduled for 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that job vacancies dropped to 7.100 million in September from 7.136 million in August.
The report arrives just days after the Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose more than expected, while wage growth was in line forecast last month, strengthening the Fed's case to continue with gradual rate hikes."
438,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 04:53PM ET</span>",GE dismisses talk that it may owe billions of dollars in taxes,"(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Monday downplayed concerns that its U.S. tax liabilities could increase by billions of dollars and that a decision by British tax authorities could saddle the company with an additional $1 billion tax bill.
""Based on current law and guidance, we believe our current accrual is a reasonable estimate for the enactment of tax reform,"" Todd Ernst, GE's vice president of investor communications, said in an unusually detailed email to investors on Monday, referring to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the bill passed by Congress that significantly reduced corporate tax rates.
Ernst said GE had disclosed the risk of $1 billion in additional British tax with third-quarter earnings, but considers it unlikely. ""We expect to successfully contest the assessment, if made, and not owe any additional taxes to the U.K.,"" Ernst said.
The payments would come after GE reported a $22.8 billion quarterly loss last week, and has seen its cash income plummet as it has taken more than $40 billion in writedowns and charges in less than a year from its power division, long-term care insurance portfolio, the tax law and other issues. 
Ernst's comments came after analyst John Inch at research firm Gordon Haskett, said years of booking ""inexplicably low tax rates"" could land GE with billions of dollars of additional cash tax payments in the United States. 
GE likely owed up to $9 billion in taxes under the 2017 corporate tax cuts, but took only a $3.3 billion charge while saying ""offsets"" would reduce cash tax costs in the future. 
""The taxman knocks,"" said Inch in the note, published on Friday. ""If even some of these 'offsets' are disallowed the company could wind up owing a large tax bill near term.""
Inch also said GE's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities could exceed $100 billion. Paying would be difficult as GE is trying to turn around troubled businesses.

Ernst said GE expects U.S. tax authorities to provide more clarity, possibly in the fourth quarter, and GE would then disclose an ""increase or decrease in liability.""

445,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 04:07PM ET</span>",Supreme Court mulls Virginia ban on mining biggest U.S. uranium deposit,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices, hearing a challenge to Virginia's moratorium on uranium mining, struggled on Monday over how far states can go to ban mining of the radioactive metal for public health reasons before overstepping federal law. 
The justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by a company called Virginia Uranium, Inc seeking to revive a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court that aimed to invalidate Virginia's ban, enacted in 1982. The company has said that ban conflicts with a federal law regulating nuclear power generation.
At the center of the dispute is the largest-known U.S. uranium deposit, located beneath a privately owned estate in Pittsylvania County in southern Virginia, near the North Carolina border. The company, a subsidiary of Vancouver, British Columbia-based  Virginia Energy Resources  (V:VUI), is seeking to exploit the deposit, valued at about $6 billion. 
Uranium, a main source of fuel for nuclear power plants and material in nuclear warheads, represents a vital resource for electricity and national defense. Virginia enacted its ban on uranium mining amid concerns about environmental and public safety hazards.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer and conservative Justice Samuel Alito signaled that courts should look to the Virginia legislators' motives in passing the law to determine whether it regulates only mining, as Virginia argues, or tries to curb radiological hazards, a matter that must be left to the federal government. 
""I think that's our job as a court in a relevant case to determine what the purpose is,"" Breyer said. 
'END OF THE CASE'
Some liberal justices, as well as conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, appeared to side with the state. Gorsuch told U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of President Donald Trump's administration in support of the company's position, that the U.S. Congress could have prevented states from regulating uranium mining, but did not. 
""So why isn't that the end of the case?"" Gorsuch asked.
Francisco responded that if the justices uphold the lower court's decision, ""it really is a roadmap for completely undermining a multibillion-dollar industry.""
The company has extolled the economic benefits for Virginia, saying uranium mining could mean more than a thousand jobs annually and billions of dollars for the local economy. 
It has also emphasized uranium's critical importance in nuclear weapons and powering U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, noting that most uranium used in the United States is imported, including from ""geopolitical rivals"" such as Russia. 
The dispute concerns whether the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 preempts Virginia's mining ban under the U.S. Constitution's so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law.
The Atomic Energy Act gives the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission the sole power to regulate radiation safety standards for milling uranium ore and disposing of waste byproducts known as tailings, key steps in the production of nuclear fuel. But it does not cover conventional uranium mining on non-federal land. 
Virginia has said federal law specifically allows it to ban uranium mining. It has the support of several other states concerned about protecting states' rights, including Indiana, Texas, Massachusetts and Oregon.

The plaintiffs, also including Cole Hill LLC and Bowen Minerals LLC, sued Virginia in 2015. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a trial judge's ruling to toss out the lawsuit.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.76%, the S&P 500 rose 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38%.
Energy stocks powered the broader market higher, led by a rally in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) as analysts said the company was on track to deliver strong growth.
""Chevron, which saw its output in the Permian basin grow by about 80% to more than 330,000 barrels of oil and gas a day, appears likely to raise its production guidance for growth early next year,"" said Piper Jaffray's Simmons & Co. The company's output, excluding asset sales, is on track to be at the upper end of its 4% to 7% growth expectations, Simmons added.
The rally in energy arrived even as U.S. oil prices gave up their intraday gains to settle lower after the US granted waivers to several Iranian crude customers as sanctions on Iran kicked in on Monday.
Financials also extended the rally on the back of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (NYSE:BRKa) strong 5% rally in the wake of the conglomerate's blowout quarterly results released over the weekend.
Tech, however, threatened to spoil the upbeat day on Wall Street, led by a slump in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) after Rosenblatt Securities downgraded Apple to neutral from a buy, owing to expectations of lower iPhone sales.
""Calendar fourth-quarter guidance reflects our cautious view on weaker than expected sell-through and production reductions for iPhone XS/XR,"" Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang said in a note.
The S&P 500 tech sector closed 0.18% lower, while the communication services sector, which includes Netflix, Facebook, Alphabet and telecom companies fell 0.32%.
Investor sentiment on stocks was also challenged by expectations that the U.S. mid-term elections on Tuesday, will result in divided Congress, with Democrats tipped to take control of the House.
""Markets remain in nervous form ahead of the US mid-term elections, with tech stocks in particular seeing heavy selling,"" said IG's Chris Beauchamp.
On the economic front, U.S. services activity in October eased from a 21-month highs seen last month, but topped economists' expectations, pointing to underlying strength in the economy.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC criticized  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) board on Monday for allowing the grandchildren of the company's former chairman to quietly build voting power through the soup maker's share buybacks in recent decades.
Third Point, which owns 7 percent of Campbell's stock, has been campaigning to oust its entire board at a shareholder's meeting on Nov. 29, alleging that the company has been mismanaged for years.
Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance, two Campbell heirs who sit on the company's board and own about a third of its stock, have pledged to vote against Third Point along with several other Dorrance family shareholders.
Share buybacks have given Malone and Dorrance ""almost total control"" of the company, Third Point said in a letter to shareholders. Other investors could effectively have no say in the company's most important transactions because Campbell's charter requires two-thirds of shareholder votes to approve major deals, the hedge fund said.
""The collective Dorrance family ownership — including a variety of family members not mentioned by Third Point — has continuously been above the 33 percent threshold and has been publicly disclosed for years,"" Campbell said in a statement. 
The company, which has repurchased about $11.2 billion of shares in the past 28 fiscal years, said the buybacks reflect a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and maximizing their long-term value.
Third Point said Campbell's buybacks since 1988 have shrunk its outstanding stock, helping Dorrance and Malone grow their percentage ownership of Campbell from about a fifth of shares in 1996. Filings show that the siblings have sold some Campbell stock since then.
Campbell and Third Point have been embroiled in a contentious proxy fight since early September. The soup and snack maker has said Third Point's proposed board is not qualified to oversee Campbell and that the hedge fund has failed to present new ideas to improve the company.
Third Point sued Campbell late last month, alleging its board misled investors about the competence of its directors and the way it carried out a recently completed strategic review. On Friday, Third Point's motion for expedited discovery was denied.

The maker of Prego pasta sauces and Goldfish crackers has been hurt by tumbling sales and a higher debt burden from the Snyder's-Lance deal. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 03:23PM ET</span>","Citigroup names new chairman, keeps post separate from CEO","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The board of  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) on Monday named one its independent members to be its new chairman, keeping the post separate from Chief Executive Mike Corbat.
John C. Dugan, 63, a former bank regulator and former lawyer to the board who became a Citigroup director last year, will succeed Mike O'Neill on Jan. 1, the company said. O'Neill recently reached the board's retirement age of 72 and was due to leave in April.
Corbat, 58, had not asked to be considered for the job of chairman after concluding that it would be best to separate it from his management job, a person familiar with his view said. Corbat and O'Neill had discussed the question over the past year, said the person, who declined to be quoted discussing the private conversations.
As chairman, O'Neill led directors to name Corbat as CEO in October 2012 when the board dismissed Vikram Pandit from the job.
The CEOs of Citigroup big bank rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) also serve as chairmen of their boards. But the dual assignments have been challenged by shareholders who believe board chairmen should be independent of the company executives they are assigned to oversee. 
The change in the leadership of the Citigroup board comes as the bank, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, struggles to catch up with the financial performance of its peers after it suffered massive losses in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, took government bailouts and had to sell assets.
Corbat is pushing the bank to reach 2020 financial targets he laid out last year after missing targets he set in 2013.
In the statement from Citigroup, Dugan said, ""I am confident in Mike Corbat and his team’s ability to continue to improve returns for its shareholders.""
Corbat said, ""Citi and our shareholders have been well served by having an independent chairman.""
Dugan began advising the Citigroup board in 2015 while he was a Washington lawyer at Covington & Burling, where he headed the law firm's financial institutions group.
Dugan was Comptroller of the Currency from 2005 to 2010. The U.S. government agency supervises national banks and federal branches of foreign banks. After graduating in 1981 from Harvard Law School, Dugan had worked in a variety of government posts in Washington and at Covington & Burling from 1993 to 2005.

O'Neill's decision to leave a few months early will allow Dugan to lead the board as it makes decisions on executive pay for 2018 and sets views on shareholder issues ahead of the Citigroup annual meeting in April.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 3.10% after announcing Monday that it would expand free shipping to all shoppers in the U.S. this holiday season, without any minimum threshold, as it looks to beat its rivals to consumer's wallets during the crucial holiday season.
The announcement was not well received, with some on Wall Street warning that the move would trigger short-term pain for the e-commerce behemoth, though over the longer-term it would likely lead to revenue growth.
""We believe Amazon’s expansion of free shipping ahead of Christmas in the US will be positive for unit growth and retail revenue, both increasing concerns coming out of third-quarter earnings, but will likely weigh on near-term profitability,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.
Auto parts company Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) fell 4.00%, giving up some of its gains, following its third-quarter results last week. Aptiv provided light fourth-quarter guidance and cautious 2019 commentary, which RBC said was ""conservative"" as the bank maintained its outperform rating on the company's stock.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday, as oil prices lifted energy stocks and defensive sectors such as real estate and utilities gained, but a drop in Apple's shares dragged down the Nasdaq.
The iPhone maker's shares (O:AAPL) fell 3.7 percent to a 3-month low after a Nikkei report that the company had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.
The stock is on track to post its worst two-day loss since January 2013, after the company's disappointing holiday-quarter forecast sent its shares down about 7 percent on Friday.
The energy sector (SPNY), which has lagged the broader S&P 500 (SPX) this year, was up 1.35 percent as the United States imposed a range of punitive sanctions on Iran, lifting oil prices by about 1 percent. [O/R]
 Chevron  (N:CVX) rose 3.9 percent, while EQT Corp (N:EQT) and Cabot Oil (N:COG) were the top gainers on the S&P 500, rising 7.2 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.

Opinion polls show a strong chance for President Donald Trump's Republican Party holding the Senate but losing control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats - a potential hurdle to Trump's pro-business agenda, which has been a major driver of the stock market's rally since the 2016 election.
""The market would've been up a lot more if it wasn't for technology. It seems like people are trying to hedge in case there is a relief rally after the election,"" said Aaron Jett, vice president for global equity research at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles.
""If the Democrats win, Trump could be more likely to want to get some kind of win, so he might be willing to do more deal with China.""

451,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Medtech group Medacta readies Swiss IPO next year: sources,"ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Swiss medical technology company Medacta is preparing to float on the SIX Swiss Exchange in spring next year, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are leading the deal with the help of JP Morgan and UBS, the sources said.
The company was not immediately available for comment and the banks all declined comment.
Family-owned Medacta generates annual sales of around 300 million Swiss francs, one of the people said. The company based in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino will likely float just a minority stake at first.
Medacta, which employs 930 people, develops and manufactures orthopedic implants for knees and spines. Another Swiss implant group, Basel-based Medartis, was valued at 563 million Swiss francs when it went public in March.
Medacta's higher profitability should give it a significantly higher market capitalization, the sources said.
Swiss trainmaker Stadler is also in the starting blocks for a Swiss listing next year. 
The Swiss market for flotations is likely to slow next year after 10 new listings so far in 2018, of which six were initial public offerings (IPOs).
""IPOs only work now for companies with crisis-proof business models,"" one source said, noting investors had become much more selective given market fluctuations.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:04PM ET</span>",Goldman tracking ahead of $5 billion revenue goal by 2020,"By Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is tracking ahead of its goal to generate $5 billion in additional annual revenue by 2020 as growth initiatives bear fruit, its new finance chief said on Monday.
The revenue-boosting plan that management laid out last year has produced $2.5 billion so far in 2018, according to a presentation by Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr at an industry event. He stopped short of increasing the target, but suggested Goldman could still do better.
""While we are meeting our objectives, these initiatives are not the limit of our ambition. Numerous business opportunities exist beyond the $5 billion (target),"" said Scherr, who plans to provide a strategic update in the spring. 
The presentation marks the first under a new management team at Goldman Sachs. The bank is now led by a group of longtime dealmakers, including Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, who started on Oct. 1, Chief Operating Officer John Waldron and Scherr, who gave the presentation on his first day as CFO.
Goldman, once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading houses, has suffered as tougher regulations make it harder to maintain profits at its trading businesses and as customer trends change since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
Its new management wants to reshape the business. It is conducting a ""front-to-back"" review and will make a ""clinical assessment"" of whether each business is meeting its cost of capital, Scherr said, adding that the bank is not looking to shrink or exit businesses, but instead determine where to deploy capital for the best returns.
Scherr's presentation showed Goldman making headway on plans to lend more to consumers and big businesses. Its fledgling digital bank, Marcus, now has 2 million customers and it wants to grow that business's market share to eventually become a ""one-stop shop for financial well-being,"" Scherr said.
The bank is also working to improve areas such as trading, and to squeeze more revenue from the investment bank where Solomon and his deputies built their careers. That business has generated $40 billion in deal volume from new customers since Goldman launched its strategy in 2016.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a report last week that it could take a significant amount of time for Goldman to truly change its earnings mix by growing organically rather than pursuing a substantial acquisition. Whichever path it pursues, he said, the bank is headed in the right direction.
""Goldman Sachs really wants to get bigger in growth businesses that investors and clients value most,"" Schorr said.

Goldman shares were down 0.9 percent at $227.71 in mid-morning trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Takeover Panel is proposing changes to the way it regulates merger and acquisition activity in the light of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, it said on Monday.
The panel plans to scrap the rules governing companies that currently have a shared jurisdiction following Brexit in a move that means takeover offers for some firms would fall outside the UK's tightly-regulated M&A regime. 
Under the plan, bids for companies that have their registered office in a country that is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) but whose securities trade in the UK and not in that state will no longer be subject to Britain's Takeover Code.
Takeover offers for businesses that have their registered office in the UK but whose securities trade outside the country in an EEA state will also no longer fall under the panel's rules if that company does not satisfy a residency test. 
A consultation on the proposals will run until Dec. 17, the regulator said.
It said while its Code Committee recognized that some businesses in question and their investors might prefer the code to continue to apply to them following Brexit, removing the shared jurisdiction rules was ""a natural consequence"" of the UK's departure from the EU. 
""The Code Committee... does not believe there is a compelling argument for the code to be amended to ensure an offer for such a company should continue to be regulated by the panel post-exit,"" it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top banks may have survived a milestone test of their resilience but strengthened balance sheets count for little when they generate such meager returns compared with U.S. rivals, investors say.
The European Banking Authority stress test results on Friday showed the sector in reasonable financial health, with a clean sweep of 48 lenders judged capable of withstanding economic shocks like a crash in real estate or bond prices.
For the first time since 2009, the EU health check of the sector showed all top banks passed a key capital threshold under the most adverse economic scenario.
However European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos on Monday said a dozen banks that came below the 9 percent threshold in the adverse scenario should strengthen their capital positions.
Those banks include  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).

Fears of fresh cash calls partly explain why investors are still running shy of the sector. The STOXX European banks index (SX7P), which has tumbled 20 percent so far this year, held flat on Monday following the results. This rejection looks set to continue as Europe's economic prospects darken, according to some fund managers and analysts. 
A decade on from the financial crisis and despite years of central bank stimulus, Europe's growth is slowing, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting full-year GDP growth in the euro zone of 2.1 percent this year and 1.8 percent next.
That reflects an outlook depressed in part by Italy's political crisis, the slowdown in Turkey and the likely fallout from Britain's divorce from the European Union, which were all factored into the stress test scenarios.
On the surface, European bank stocks look like bargains. The sector's valuation via the STOXX bank index (SX7P) is hovering just above all-time lows, long after lenders shed the toxic assets that destroyed faith in the financial system in 2007.
But the fact that bank capital levels are now roughly three times higher than pre-crisis levels has failed to offset worries about where bank revenue growth is going to come from.
""Profitability remains quite a problem for many banks in Europe,"" Mario Quagliariello, director of economic analysis at the EBA, told Reuters.
ROUGH YEAR
Low base rates - 0.75 percent in Britain and negative 0.4 percent in the euro zone - are forcing lenders to cut margins and take greater risks as demand for loans slows amid stagnant growth, resulting in paltry returns for investors.
""European bank stocks have had a rough year thus far - and until there is economic data that suggests robust economic growth in the eurozone, bank stocks seem unlikely to recover,"" said Mike Olivia, an advisor at WestPac Wealth Partners, which holds bank stocks.
Bank bosses also have fewer freedoms to make money in investment banking post-financial crisis, investors say. This is compounded by an equally striking incapacity to curb costs. 
And tighter regulation has made the sector safer but less lucrative, fund managers say, making it a tougher sell to their insurance and pension fund clients, who demand bigger rewards for what they perceive to be riskier investments.
EU banks' average return on equity in 2017 stood at 5.6 percent, just over half the 2007 level of 10.6 percent, according to data from the European Banking Federation and below the 9 percent recorded by U.S. peers.
U.S. lenders' investment banking businesses have increased their market share at the expense of their European rivals, thanks to weaker markets and tougher regulations in Europe, and laid bare in much more impressive operating margins - a key measure of profitability - for the U.S. banks.
The top U.S. banks' equities and fixed income businesses ran at margins of 31 and 42 percent in the first half of this year, according to data from Coalition, compared with 14 and 27 percent for the same businesses in Europe's biggest investment banks.

POWERLESS
The biggest two buying signals for investors in banks are an uptick in interest rates, followed by growth in demand for debt. But both of these factors are in the hands of policymakers, not bank CEOs, noted Vincent Vinatier, portfolio manager at AXA IM (PA:AXAF), which holds bank shares.
""Most people doubt we will ever again see the kinds of profits we saw before the crisis ... ROE (return on equity) will be just a fraction of what it was,"" Vinatier told Reuters.
Long-awaited rate rises will come, but those who jumped back into European bank shares in February, when hopes of a shift in monetary policy last peaked, have been punished with a 20 percent fall in prices.
When rates do move upwards, this will likely happen in small increments after extensive sign-posting by EU policymakers. 
And the benefit on margins for banks will likely be largely offset by the need to repay ultra-cheap loans offered by the European Central Bank in recent years, and replace them with costlier funding, analysts at Berenberg said.
Higher debt costs could also prove fatal to a glut of so-called 'zombie firms' - companies struggling to cover borrowing costs on current profit levels. Forbearance - the act of turning a blind eye to a faltering loan - and 'zombie companies' are most apparent on Italian and Spanish bank balance sheets.
COSTS
With revenue growth so hard to capture, a tighter rein on costs is seen critical in the battle to win back investors.
""There is still much more cost cutting to be done i.e. further branch closures and retrenchment of people,"" said Marc Halperin, manager of the Federated International Leaders Fund, which counts ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), AIB Group (I:AIBG),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), BNP Paribas,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit among its holdings.
Expenses at Barclays' investment bank, for example, continue to spiral, leaving the bank short of its target to cut group cost to income to under 60 percent.
 Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Finance Director Andy Halford said his bank had made ""virtually no progress"" on reducing costs this year in a leaked staff email last month.
And the benefits achieved by cutting jobs and branches have been eclipsed by fresh spending in technology and cyber defense.
Banks have largely put massive penalties for past misconduct behind them but regulatory compliance is an unavoidable overhead set to rise as activities expand.
And promises of 4, 5 and even 6 percent annual dividend payouts are not luring investors either, because European utilities, telecoms and insurers can offer the same dividends at reduced risk, fund managers said.
Banks are the second cheapest sector on a price to earnings basis, trading at 9.1 times consensus estimates on 2019 earnings, a 30 percent discount to the market while offering a estimated 2019 yield of 5.7 percent, Berenberg data shows. 
Only the autos sector is cheaper.
Although neutral to the sector, analysts at Bernstein said investors had rarely had a better opportunity to buy the ROE currently offered by the sector at such cheap prices.
""If one did want to make a positive case for it, the European banks are somewhat cheaply valued against their level of ROE compared to what history would suggest.""
The most bearish of investors say the lack of love for European banks reflects growing fears the European project is ultimately doomed, or another global financial crisis triggered by trade wars or sovereign insolvency is just around the corner. 
""The next financial crisis will be triggered by sovereign debt, rather than the banks themselves. However the banks own a lot of the sovereign debt so there is contagion risk,"" said Matthew Gallagher, managing member at Odinic Advisors. 

""Greece and Italy are starting to show cracks and won't be helped as interest rates rise in the US.""

466,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 12:06PM ET</span>",Ex-Wall Street banker's insider trading conviction overturned,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Monday overturned the insider trading conviction of a former Wall Street investment banker accused of passing tips about five mergers in the healthcare industry to his father, and ordered a new trial.
In a 2-1 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Sean Stewart, who worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Perella Weinberg Partners, should have been allowed to challenge a crucial piece of evidence, a recorded conversation between his father and a friend who was cooperating with prosecutors.
The Manhattan-based appeals court had in June released Stewart, 37, from prison after just one year of his three-year sentence, signaling he would likely to win a reversal, new trial or lesser sentence. It had heard his appeal in February.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.
Alexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Stewart, was pleased the conviction was overturned, calling the excluded evidence ""critical to Mr. Stewart's defense.""
Stewart was convicted in August 2016 on nine fraud and conspiracy counts for passing tips to his father Robert from 2011 to 2015.
Prosecutors said this led to $1.16 million of profit for Robert Stewart and his friend Richard Cunniffe, to whom he had forwarded some tips.
In the recorded conversation, Robert Stewart recounted to Cunniffe how his son had complained about his failure to take advantage of some inside information by saying: ""I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest in this.""
Sean Stewart sought to introduce statements his father later made to the FBI suggesting he did not intend to commit insider trading, or had been drinking when he made the ""silver platter"" comment.
The trial judge, Laura Taylor Swain, rejected this request, because Robert Stewart never specifically said his son had not made the ""silver platter"" statement.
But in an unsigned decision, the appeals court said this was an error that was not harmless.
It cited the importance to the government's case of the statement, which prosecutors repeatedly called ""devastating,"" and the jury's five-day struggle to reach a verdict.
""Robert's FBI interview offered fundamentally distinct recollections of the silver platter exchange that cast a different light on Sean's intentions"" and could have ""tempered the statement's 'devastating' effect,"" the majority said.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, sitting by designation, dissented. He called evidence of Sean Stewart's guilt ""overwhelming"" even without the silver platter statement.
Robert Stewart pleaded guilty to a related conspiracy charge, and Cunniffe to fraud and conspiracy charges. Both were sentenced to probation.

The case is U.S. v. Stewart, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-593.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears nears bankruptcy financing deal without Lampert's hedge fund - sources,"By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) is nearing a deal with new lenders to increase a bankruptcy financing package to as much as $600 million, from $300 million, without Chairman Eddie Lampert's hedge fund contributing, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The deal, which may come as soon as this week, could provide enough money for the beleaguered U.S. retailer to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday shopping season and retain sufficient support from creditors and vendors to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.
The stakes are high, given that Sears faces a Dec. 15 deadline to name a so-called stalking-horse bidder that would make an initial offer, which others could later top, for hundreds of stores that would survive under a new owner. 
Sears is in the final stages of negotiations with multiple investment firms to receive up to $450 million in bankruptcy financing in exchange for key collateral currently held by banks lending to the retailer, the sources said. Cyrus Capital Partners LP is one of the investment firms in discussion with Sears, one of the sources said.
That collateral includes some store leases, the sources said. In return, the banks are expected to reduce their exposure to Sears by lending $150 million, instead of the $300 million originally promised, to the department store operator, according to the sources. 
Lampert is not expected to contribute to the financing after the retailer garnered adequate interest from other lenders, the sources said. Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, had been in discussions in recent days about participating in the financing, the sources added. 
However, ESL still remains open to lending additional money to Sears should the company fall short of the funds it needs in its final negotiations with other potential lenders, one of the sources said.
A financing deal is expected to be announced as soon as this week, though the negotiations remain fluid and an agreement is not guaranteed, the sources said. 
A Sears spokesman and a Cyrus spokeswoman declined to comment.
Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15 with a plan to close about 142 of its 700 stores by the end of the year, throwing into doubt the future of the 125-year-old retailer that once dominated U.S. malls but has withered in the age of internet shopping. 
Sears, which employs roughly 68,000 people, is negotiating with ESL on a potential initial bid on financially healthier stores that executives believe could keep the retailer alive, according to the sources and court filings. 
ESL could end up bidding on up to 500 Sears stores, or about 100 more than the 400 healthier stores Sears initially identified when filing for bankruptcy, one of the sources said. 
Sears has had trouble raising additional financing beyond what banks originally promised. That is because ESL and other possible new lenders balked at providing as much as $300 million that would be second in line for repayment and lacked the desired collateral to back the loan, the sources said. 

A hearing to finalize Sears' bankruptcy financing is scheduled for Nov. 15, according to a court filing.

By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Friday it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over forecasts it made about Model 3 production in 2017, a set of targets the electric vehicle company failed to hit on time.
The SEC issued subpoenas over ""certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production,"" Tesla said in a quarterly filing on Friday. A subpoena can compel a company to turn over materials that the requesting agency wants to review.
The SEC had also issued subpoenas in connection with Chief Executive Elon Musk's previous statements that he was considering taking the company private, it said.
Both the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice are looking at whether Tesla misled investors about its business. 
""To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,"" Tesla wrote in its filing.
The SEC declined to comment. 
The company also said on Friday that 44 percent of its third-quarter net profit was from previously undisclosed regulatory credits.
Investors have been trying to ascertain if the worst is over for the Silicon Valley company amid the fallout from Musk's short-lived plan in August to take the company private, and determine if Tesla has finally stabilized its rocky Model 3 production and can build the car at a profit.
Following the launch of the Model 3 last year, Tesla repeatedly missed aggressive production targets for the new vehicle, blaming ""manufacturing bottlenecks.""
Jay Dubow, a partner with Pepper Hamilton LLP and former branch chief in the SEC's enforcement division, said the agency was likely looking at whether Tesla's projections had been ""based on fact or not.""
""It is possible for another SEC enforcement action down the road if it turns out that the projections were purposefully or recklessly made without a basis,"" Dubow said.
Tesla is already facing a proposed class action shareholder lawsuit claiming that the company and top executives made false statements about the readiness of the Model 3 for volume production. The lawsuit cites repeated promises in 2017 that Tesla was ""on track"" to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of that year at its factory in Fremont, California.
Tesla finally met that target in June of this year.
Tesla has denied the claims, saying it disclosed production bottlenecks once identified, and pointing to Musk's public statements that the company was undergoing a period of ""production hell"" in 2017.
A Tesla spokesperson told Reuters last week that the company had received a voluntary request from the Department of Justice for documents related to Model 3 production forecasts, but had not received a subpoena.
ZERO EMISSION CREDITS
Tesla has weathered a rocky few months in the wake of Musk's tweets that he had ""funding secured"" for a deal, later scuttled, to take Tesla private. Musk and Tesla settled with the SEC in September after the agency sued for fraud.
The settlement required Tesla and Musk to pay a fine of $20 million each and for Musk to give up his chairman role for three years.
Last week, investors were cheered by the company's third-quarter net profit, wider margins and positive cash flow, which sent shares climbing. 
The company said then it had booked $52 million in ""zero emission vehicle"" credit sales. It did not say at the time that it had gained another $137 million in regulatory credits, which contributed to nearly half of the profit.
Tesla also said in its quarterly filing that it planned to start building about 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in Shanghai in the initial phase of its Gigafactory 3, to reduce the impact of tariffs.
Model S and Model X sales in China will likely continue to be hurt by recently increased tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S.-manufactured vehicles, it said.

Tesla shares closed up less than half a percent to $346.41 on Friday.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Takeda CEO confident of investor backing for $62 billion Shire deal,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - The boss of Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) said on Monday he was confident of securing investor backing for its $62 billion acquisition of London-listed  Shire  (L:SHP), despite some shareholders' fears about the resulting debt burden.
Buoyed by a strong set of quarterly results last week - helped by strong demand for its existing drugs - Chief Executive Christophe Weber insisted that buying rare diseases specialist Shire was not a defensive move.
""We are quite satisfied with our current progress at Takeda. Our business is doing well,"" he told the FT Global Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology conference in London. 
""We don't have to do this Shire acquisition. We just feel it is a way to accelerate our progress and our evolution.""
Takeda has already gained approval for what would be the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company from U.S., Japanese and Chinese regulators - but it is still waiting for the nod from European authorities.
Crucially, Takeda also needs two-thirds support from shareholders. It has set Oct. 19 as the record date entitling investors to vote in an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on the deal, allowing it to hold the meeting within a three-month period ending Jan. 18. Alternatively, it could set a new record date.
Takeda, which has a market value of around $32 billion, has secured a $30.9 billion bridge loan to help finance the Shire acquisition and some investors are concerned as to how well it will cope with debt repayments.
Weber, however, said he was confident he had persuaded Takeda shareholders sufficiently for the company to name an EGM date, without specifying exactly when it would be held.
The Japanese company struck its agreement to take over Shire in May, a deal that will propel it into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers by sales, alongside the likes of  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and  Pfizer  (N:PFE).
It will also increase Takeda's exposure to the U.S. drugs market - the world's biggest - which will account for around half of the enlarged group's business, just as President Donald Trump puts a squeeze on drugmakers to cut their prices.
Weber said Trump's plans to base the price the government's Medicare program pays for some medications on the lower prices paid in other countries would add to pressure but would not undermine the fundamental attractions of the U.S. marketplace.
""This is still the country where new innovative medicine has the fastest access - there is this willingness to treat patients with the latest medicine,"" he said.

""My assumption always has been there would be more price pressure in the U.S. and we have to deal with it.""

In an interview with Axios' Jonathan Swan and Jim VandeHei on the news site's premiere HBO show Sunday night, Trump said the European Union's $5 billion fine against Google made him consider pursuing regulation.
""You look at the European Union, they fined I guess it was Google, billions of dollars, and frankly I don't like that they're doing that because that's an American company,"" Trump said. ""I don't think it's good that they're doing that. But if anybody does that, it should be us doing it.""
Swan asked if Trump would direct the Justice Department to look into the company as a monopoly, and Trump responded it was ""certainly something we're looking at.""
When asked if he would ever break the companies up, Trump said previous administrations had discussed it but the action never materialized.
""But you're in charge now,"" Swan interjected.
""I am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it,"" Trump said, before clarifying he was talking about antitrust proceedings for all three companies.
Responsibility for such proceedings would fall to the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division.

While U.S. stocks could be in for a choppy ride during the rest of 2018 as liquidity is unlikely to improve, most of the price damage is done for now, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Michael Wilson.
“We see the need for some healing and the Rolling Bear turning into a Chopping Bear as investors try to figure out what will lead during a time of year when short-term performance pressure may exert more influence than normal,” Wilson wrote in a note Monday.
Wilson has deployed “rolling bear” for months to capture the idea that markets would be hit by a series of blows affecting different sectors at different times, as the Federal Reserve’s tightening and a less-synchronized global economic expansion weighed on equities.
Read More: Morgan Stanley Says Sell Rallies as Goldman Sees Chance to Buy
Shrinking liquidity from the Fed’s quantitative tightening, and now the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan tapering quantitative-easing purchases, has been a focus all year, Wilson wrote. It reached a “tipping point” early last month and was likely the primary catalyst for stocks’ worst month since the 2011-12 equity bear market, he added.
“The good news is that global asset prices now reflect this risk,” Wilson wrote. “The bad news is that the growth in global central bank balance sheets is set to decelerate and go negative by January. We think this will accentuate the choppiness and make it difficult to trade.”
Wilson also highlighted the changing fortunes of value and growth stocks.
Morgan Stanley’s “shopping list” screen leans toward value cyclicals, according to the report, naming Baker Hughes, Continental Resources Inc., SVB Financial Group,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). as among the value stocks on the list. World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. also made the roster; it’s a bit more expensive “‘but still looks compelling to us given the magnitude of its recent sell-off,” according to the report.
“We have had a preference for value over growth since late July. October’s relative outperformance in a down market is encouraging and we think signals a more important, longer lasting leadership change,” Wilson wrote. “Whether we are right or wrong, we think getting this right will be more important than calling the index level for the rest of the year.”

488,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Germany pushes for European front against tax trade tricks,"By Peter Maushagen and John O'Donnell
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's finance minister will urge European ministers this week to tighten cooperation against abusive tax schemes, after Reuters and other media revealed sham trading deals that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
In comments sent to Reuters, Germany's Olaf Scholz described a stock-trading scheme to generate illicit double tax rebates as a ""scandal"" that underscored the need for better European cooperation. 
Scholz's comments, which are his strongest condemnation of the practice yet, will fuel debate about preventing a repeat of schemes, known as cum-ex, which hit Germany, Denmark and other countries.
The practice typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners - each entitled to a tax rebate.
""The cum-ex business was a real scandal that cost the state and honest citizens billions,"" said Scholz, adding that he had told his officials to investigate any possible new variations.
""Such tricks cause anger,"" he said. ""It's good if we speak in the EU about the exchange of information and whether we should improve it.""
Scholz will deliver this message to EU finance ministers in Brussels on Nov 6.
Danish politicians have already called for action to tackle dividend-stripping after Reuters and other media, coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv, revealed the large-scale use of such trading schemes. 
TRICKED
Danish tax authorities say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros by a similar ""cum-ex"" method. Other countries, including Austria and Belgium, were also hit.
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to stamp out the practice. But the scam hit Denmark in the years that followed, prompting criticism of Berlin for failing to properly warn Copenhagen.
Denmark's minister of taxation Karsten Lauritzen recently said that ""the Danish public needs ... to know if we would have been able to stop the fraud had we received the information from Germany"".
Lauritzen has described international cooperation as ""not ... good enough"". The German finance ministry said it had informed other countries, when asked, about how the stock trading scheme worked.
Although most European countries belong to the EU and obey numerous common rules, they have widely different tax regimes. Sharing information around Europe is often piecemeal and fragmented.
National tax authorities are also subject to strict confidentiality rules, making it hard to informally share information. 
Germany is now investigating a number of banks for involvement in cum-ex, in what is the country's biggest post-war fraud probe. 
The prosecutors say the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a dividend tax credit.

Scholz said he wanted to prevent a repeat. ""What counts now is to prevent any new attempts at aggressive, cross-border tax fraud,"" he said.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 08:51AM ET</span>","Buy, sell or hold: Ten ways to trade the U.S. election","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buy the dollar but sell FAANGs, buy real estate and machinery, but sell the overall market. Or, do nothing at all. 
Investors heading into Tuesday's U.S. congressional elections are trying to fathom how best to predict the outcome and profit from it. 
After two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, the Democratic Party faces a strong chance of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next week's election, with Republicans likely to keep the Senate.
These are some of the ideas that analysts, strategists and traders have: 
* BUY ANY DOLLAR DIP 
If the greenback drops against other currencies on the election result,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) says it should be bought. “Midterms are less likely to mark a major turning point for USD than some investors fear,” Citi analyst Todd Elmer said in a report. 
There is no strong historical relationship between midterms and the path of the U.S. currency, making a Democratic House victory unlikely to thwart the dollar's rally, Citi said. 
* FAANGs COULD FALL ON DIVIDED CONGRESS 
One policy initiative that looks viable under a divided Congress is increased regulation of social media companies, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “That is an area where both the Trump administration and Democrats agree,” he said. “We expect that to occur in 2019.” If that happens, shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have come under increased pressure this year, could have more downside.
* BUY CONSTRUCTION STOCKS 
Dryden Pence, chief investment officer of Pence Wealth Management in Newport Beach, California, is looking to buy construction-related stocks, as he anticipates that an infrastructure bill, one of Trump’s agenda items, will come to pass regardless of which party controls Congress. “For infrastructure, the most important thing about the election is that it will be over,” he said. Among the stocks Pence likes are  United Rentals  Inc (N:URI), AECOM (N:ACM), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (N:JEC) and Vulcan Materials Co (N:VMC).
* BUY REITS ON DEMOCRATIC WIN 
Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management, a manager of real assets, said if the Democrats win the House, it likely signals the end of tax cuts or an infrastructure bill for Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election. If this happens, it would be good news for the 10-year bond yield, and ""a lower 10-year bond yield is good news for REITs.""
* BUY MACHINERY STOCKS 
Analysts at Stifel see Trump quickly proposing a “Highway Bill” when the House takes office if Democrats win control of the lower chamber That may lead to increased political rancor and Trump may take the high road of “the people’s business” by proposing a transportation bill, benefiting  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and Deere & Co (N:DE).
* CUT EM FOR RED REPEAT 
Those positioning for a further poll shift toward Republicans should be prepared for emerging market weakness, wrote Michael Zezas at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a research note. 
""The potential for a stronger USD and increased leeway for further trade escalation would likely weigh on emerging markets risk appetite. Already cheap valuations would likely protect parts of EM, yet we think Asia would still be at risk due to trade linkages and previous strong equity inflows. Our global EM strategy team suggests short KRW, SGD, TWD with PHP, IDR and INR also vulnerable."" 
* EXPECT VOLATILITY TO FALL 
Some investment strategists are expecting volatility to ease after the U.S. midterm elections as the elimination of at least one uncertainty the market is facing right now will give traders less reason to worry regardless of what the outcome is. 
Parag Thatte, equities strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York says: ""Our trading desk thinks betting on volatility reducing after the election would be a good trade right now.”
* EXPECT BIOTECH TO FALL 
    If Democrats take control of the House and Republicans continue to have an edge in the Senate, UBS Wealth Management analysts say that among the areas where the president and Congress could find common ground are drug price controls and infrastructure spending; the former could pressure large pharma and even biotech stocks lower, or limit their gains, while the latter could boost those in engineering, construction and building materials.
* DON'T BELIEVE THE POLLS 
BMO Capital Markets analysts Jon Hill, Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery wrote in a recent note that many of their clients are skeptical of political polls on the congressional elections. That skepticism suggests that current valuations do not fully reflect the polls' expectations and Treasury yields may still move down if Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. The analysts also wrote that a potential error in the polls might not necessarily skew toward Republicans, allowing for the possibility of a bigger Democratic win than is currently projected.
* DO NOTHING
""In our view, investors should avoid making investment changes based purely on fears or speculation of election outcomes,"" said analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.

It is more important for investors to maintain and follow their longer-term investment plan, and await signs of action in Congress, they said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top echelons of  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) Inc's investment bank hosted a dinner over the summer with the representatives of almost 20 private equity firms at Manhattan's Legacy Records restaurant.
The executives invited, however, were not among the buyout industry's power players Goldman is known for banking, such as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman or KKR & Co Inc co-CEOs Henry Kravis and George Roberts.
Instead, the guests included the bosses of private equity firms such as H.I.G. Capital, Olympus Partners and Charlesbank Capital Partners. These firms focus on ""middle-market"" transactions, which Goldman classifies as acquisitions between $500 million and $3 billion in size, a far cry from the mega-deals it has built its investment banking brand on. 
Over a meal of Atlantic halibut and dry-aged ribeye steaks, Gregg Lemkau, co-head of Goldman's investment bank, and Alison Mass, in charge of the financial sponsors coverage group, pressed one message: Goldman is serious about advising on relatively small leveraged buyouts.
The bank has sought to back up this claim with a major hiring spree. It created a dedicated team for M&A execution within its ""financial sponsors"" group covering private equity clients, and has grown this group from zero to 27 bankers in the last three years. Previously, M&A execution was handled by the bank's sector teams. 
The initiative illustrates how Goldman, already the No. 1 bank for private equity firms by fees earned, is looking between the sofa cushions for any new source of income to hit its goal, unveiled last year, of growing revenues by $5 billion by 2020.
Goldman's new chief executive, David Solomon, is seeking to remove the bank's reliance on volatile trading revenue, making expanding the already dominant investment bank a key part of this strategy.
Goldman has already been scoring its fair share of smaller deals. League table data from industry tracker Dealogic show Goldman has held a top three position in fees earned from U.S. private equity-related deals between $500 million and $3 billion since at least 2013. However, in 2018, the bank is on track to have its highest fee share in that segment since 2014, Dealogic data showed.
""We had a look within the investment bank where we could grow our share of the pie and they saw an opportunity in the middle market,"" Goldman's Mass said in an interview. 
ATTRACTING SENIOR BANKERS
One hurdle Goldman faces in implementing this strategy is attracting enough senior talent. Traditionally, the financial sponsors team was seen internally as training ground for many investment bankers, who learned to work on deals before they cultivated relationships with the corporate world's movers and shakers, bank insiders said.
Many investment banks that are focused on the middle market, on the other hand, often boast careerists who have spent decades cultivating relationships with private equity firms that do smaller deals.
To counter this, Goldman Sachs has poached senior bankers covering private equity firms from the likes of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
There are plans to grow the M&A team further, especially in Europe, Mass and David Friedland, global head of the sponsor M&A team, said, without elaborating on the potential new hires.
""One thing we've tried to address is the misperception, often put forth by our competitors, that our most experienced M&A people were not also working on these (middle-market) deals,"" said Friedland.
T. J. Maloney, chairman and CEO of Lincolnshire Management, a private equity firm specializing in the middle market, said he had seen more deal flow from Goldman in the last couple of years.
""They made a push by hiring some pretty good people in the middle market, people who are really focused on covering sponsors like us,"" said Rich Lawson, co-founder and CEO of HGGC, another private equity firm which invests in middle-market businesses.
The new M&A group for private equity firms at Goldman was the brainchild of Stephanie Cohen, who last year was tapped by the bank to be its head of strategy. The group has helped diversify the bank's fee revenue from private equity firms beyond the sector's biggest players, such as Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR.

""Over the course of the last two or three years, they've done a very good job reestablishing the connection with folks like us,"" said Scott Sperling, co-president at Thomas H. Lee Partners, another U.S. private equity firm.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Investors in one of Abraaj's Middle East and North Africa funds have hired New York-based Duff & Phelps in an effort to recover money owed by the stricken private equity company, say sources familiar with the matter.
The advisory firm will seek to trace an estimated $33 million owed by Abraaj relating to the Infrastructure and Growth Capital Fund and to ensure a suitable manager is brought in to oversee it, the sources said. The fund's net asset value was estimated at around $700 million, one of the sources added.
The fund is one of several where court-appointed liquidators Deloitte and PwC have yet to pick preferred bidders for management rights.
Duff & Phelps did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Deloitte and PwC declined to comment.
Abraaj was a $13.6 billion emerging market specialist with more than 200 investments, but late last year four investors questioned its use of their money in a healthcare fund triggering a crisis at Abraaj and its provisional liquidation.
A report from the liquidators in July acknowledged there were potential claims arising from the alleged ""co-mingling"" of funds and withdrawal of cash from the Infrastructure and Growth Capital Fund and another fund, Private Equity Fund IV.
Another advisory firm, Alvarez & Marsal has already been hired by investors in Abraaj Private Equity Fund IV to help recover an estimated $130 million owed by Abraaj relating to that fund, the sources said, adding that the amount might change. The fund's net asset value was estimated at around $700 to $800 million, one of the sources said.
Actis was last month given a 30 day exclusivity period to reach the required threshold of 75 percent of investor support for its bid to take over the management of that fund. Kuwait's Agility, in partnership with asset management firm Capital Dynamics, and Abu Dhabi Financial Group are separately seeking to get the 36 percent level of investor support in order to block Actis's bid, the sources said.
Actis declined to comment.
Agility and Abu Dhabi Financial Group are competing for most of the other Middle East and North Africa funds, the sources said.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) said on Monday it will reorganize its business segments into Consumer, Business and Verizon Media Group/Oath to focus on the types of customers it serves. 
The reorganization under Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg, who was named to the top job on Aug. 1, is a shift from the previous operating structure split between wireless and wireline and included the largest U.S. wireless carrier's Fios internet and video products.
The company said the new Verizon Media Group/Oath segment will include media, advertising and technology, and be led by Guru Gowrappan, who had been appointed CEO of Oath, the digital media umbrella that includes Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and AOL. 
""Content is going to be important for 5G, and we're doing that within Oath,"" Vestberg said in an interview, adding there are no changes in the company's previous statements that it is focused on its wireless network rather than acquiring media content.
The Verizon Consumer Group will include the consumer segment of the company's wireless and wireline businesses, and will be led by Ronan Dunne, currently president of Verizon Wireless.
Verizon Business Group will include products and services sold to businesses and government, led by Tami Erwin, who is currently executive vice president of wireless operations.

The changes are effective on Jan. 1, 2019, and Verizon said it expects to begin reporting its financials under the new structure in the second quarter of 2019.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>",Cracks emerge in global aviation finance boom,"By Anshuman Daga and Tim Hepher
HONG KONG (Reuters) - An unprecedented boom in the $280 billion aircraft finance industry is showing signs of faltering as rising interest rates, cut-rate competition and higher oil prices trigger a shakeout in a sector that has attracted a flood of Chinese funding.
Conferences in Hong Kong last week saw more than 1,000 financiers, lawyers and airline bosses talk up the fundamentals of an industry that has emerged as a flourishing asset class globally, but in contrast to previous years the mood was one of subdued optimism even as corks popped on new deals.
Concerns about central bank tightening, trade rows and currency swings could blow some froth, they cautioned. 
""I think the party is over in terms of lower interest rates,"" said Robert Martin, CEO of Asia's largest-listed aircraft lessor BOC Aviation (HK:2588).
The sector veteran of three decades noted that smaller players who had not matched their funding needs to liabilities, unlike larger ones like his company, would find it difficult to ride out any volatility. 
The failure to do so has caused some high-profile collapses, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) in the 1990s.
The former GPA executives who now dominate the industry say the sector has matured and is backed by diversified sources of funding as aviation finance sits proudly alongside property and infrastructure as alternatives to traditional market bets.
Yet danger signals have emerged, such as stronger dollar hitting the coffers of many airlines just as they must adjust to a spike in oil prices. 
That could land unwanted aircraft back into the laps of lessors needing to find new takers.
In a sign of turbulence ahead, global airlines have already slashed profit forecasts due to high oil prices. 
A few leasing companies are also quietly giving airlines rental 'holidays' to help their cash flows, sources said.
And some airlines are increasing traffic only by cutting prices, which will hurt all but those with the lowest costs, said Rob Morris, chief consultant at Flight Ascend.
According to Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of asset managers IBA: ""The market is poised for the start of a correction. There are too many signals."" 
""When airlines feel pain, lessors feel pain.""
DEALS DRIVE DOWN YIELDS
The industry, however, remains in better shape than in previous cycles, driven by consolidation in the United States.
Airlines have begun to recoup their costs of capital in the past four years after decades of value destruction, according to the International Air Transport Association. 
Demand for financing for new commercial aircraft deliveries is expected to rise almost 7 percent this year to $139 billion, Boeing (N:BA) has said. 
Last week, financiers were busy doing deals overlooking Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour at conferences hosted by Airline Economics and Euromoney's Airfinance Journal. 
Lessors say liquidity is abundant and that financial strains in one part of the globe can be offset by demand elsewhere. 
Currently, Chinese capital accounts for about 30 percent of the funding deployed by leasing firms worldwide, up from 5 percent about nine years ago.
But while the carousel continues, the flood of new money chasing deals has lowered returns for most in the industry.
Goshawk Aviation, a venture of Hong Kong conglomerate NWS Holdings (HK:0659) and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, says the sector's low yields are not feasible for long.
Brian Cheng, executive director at NWS that bought Dublin-based Sky Aviation Leasing this year, said he had seen funding bids from companies that are prepared to accept returns of 3-5 percent on their aircraft investments. 
""Insurance companies or banks can achieve (these rates) because their borrowing costs are so low ... but for us there's no way to compete with that."" 
""SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE""
Against that backdrop, opportunistic M&A is also picking up.
Japan's Orix Corp (T:8591) struck a $2.2 billion deal this year for a 30 percent stake in leasing firm Avolon Holdings. 
SMBC Aviation Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking's leasing arm, expects to receive an extra $1 billion from shareholders in a couple of months, Peter Barrett, CEO of the world's No. 5 lessor said.
But with air pockets in sight, industry executives increasingly point to an expected shakeout among smaller lessors. Some smaller Chinese players are already pulling back.

""It's like driving a car on the expressway. Everybody is on the gas pedal right now. No one is going to the gas station or taking a break. Everybody is full throttle but something has got to give. Some cars will just head off to the exit,"" Cheng said.

499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","EU's Divisive Plan to Tax Facebook, Amazon Returns to Spotlight","(Bloomberg) -- A scrap among European Union countries over a proposed tax on tech giants is set to resume on Tuesday, when finance ministers try to strike a balance between luring business and addressing popular discontent about companies not paying their fair share.
Finance ministers meeting in Brussels will try to push forward a legislative proposal for a 3 percent levy on the European sales of companies with a global annual revenue of 750 million euros ($853 million) or more, such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The tech industry has pushed back against the tax, saying it would chill investment.
Spearheaded by France, the plan has met resistance from countries such as Ireland and Sweden, which question the wisdom of the EU going it alone given the global nature of digital services. Complicating things further, the tax risks triggering the ire of President Donald Trump in the midst of a transatlantic trade spat, as most of the affected companies would be U.S-based.
The U.K., often seen as a tech-friendly hub, last month announced plans to introduce its own tax on the largest Internet companies, with the goal of raising 400 million pounds ($521 million) a year. Countries from South Korea to Australia are also closing loopholes that allow companies to re-route profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. Traditional tax rules have failed to capture these companies’ activities, fueling anger from voters disgruntled after years of austerity and meager wage growth.
The idea behind the proposed EU tax is to focus on where tech users are based, rather than where a company places its headquarters. The levy would apply on revenue from “targeted advertising” and “intermediation services,” while the tax will be imposed on turnover, irrespective of profit or loss, and won’t be connected to or “creditable” against existing corporate taxes, according to confidential memos circulated among member states and seen by Bloomberg.
Some countries disagree over whether the “sale of user data” should also be taxed, according to an Oct. 29 internal memo circulated to national governments. The Austrian presidency of the Council of the European Union, which represents the interests of member states in the legislative process, is pushing for a deal by year-end.
Governments also disagree on whether the tax should have a fixed expiration date or a review clause linked to global developments, according to one of the documents. All national delegations agree that the tax would be repealed if the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or the Group of 20 nations reach a deal for a coordinated solution to tax tech companies, according to the document.
Double Taxation
In the runup to Tuesday’s meeting, some countries also expressed doubts about whether the initiative would violate existing treaties on avoiding double taxation. Adding to the confusion, the legal services of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, and the Council of member states disagree over the legal basis of the tax.
As unanimity is required to pass taxes, the levy could end up being shelved or drawn into negotiations between a smaller group of member states wishing to go it alone.
“Several member states might introduce a tax nonetheless, and create serious distortions in the EU’s single market” said Guntram Wolff, director of the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank. “Better have a European approach rather than patchwork of bad national taxes.”

The announcement on the ""technology innovation board"", to be established by the Shanghai Stock Exchange, comes as Beijing is stepping up support toward the private sector, and encouraging innovation, to mitigate the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Xi announced the decision at the start of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, but gave few details, only saying the new board will adopt a registration-based IPO system. Under the current system, all mainland IPOs must be vetted by regulators. 
Suggesting a lower listing threshold, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement on Monday that the new board will make ""more appropriate and differentiated arrangements"" regarding companies' profitability and shareholding structures, and will be more inclusive toward innovators.
""This could be China's Nasdaq,"" said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyaun Securities.
""It will post a challenge to Hong Kong,"" he said, adding Shenzhen's tech-heavy ChiNext board could also feel the pressure.
Chinese and Hong Kong bourses have stepped up their competition to attract tech firms seeking IPOs. Earlier this year Hong Kong introduced rules allowing companies with dual-class shares to list in the city, while China pursued Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs) as a way to entice overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list domestically.
Adopting a western-style registration-based IPO system would give market forces a dominant role in deciding when a company can sell shares publicly, removing regulatory hurdles facing many Chinese listing candidates.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Monday that legal hurdles for such an IPO system were removed in December, 2015, and the bourse will encourage small investors to invest in the technology innovation board via mutual funds, so that they can share growth of innovative companies. 
But Huang Sheng, veteran investor and chairman of peer-to-peer company Shenzhen Xitou Finance Service Co, said launch of a new tech board is ""not a good thing.""
""There is a liquidity shortage in the stock market. How can the market handle a new board?"" he wrote.

In addition, ""Without a sound legal, and delisting mechanism, adopting the registration-based IPO system will lead to many garbage, and fraudulent companies getting listed.""

505,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 06:09AM ET</span>","Rich Asians crazy about securing wealth spark family office boom in HK, Singapore","(This November 4th story corrects job title in paragraph 15)
By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Rich Chinese and other Asians are increasingly seeking more control of their wealth, driving a rapid rise in the number of so-called family offices, or private investment vehicles, being set up in Hong Kong and Singapore. 
As the wealthy target greater investment diversification and as business owners hand over the reins to successors, family offices are sprouting in the Asian financial hubs, taking advantage of incentives such as tax breaks and residency being offered.
The family office is a relatively new concept in Asia, with less than 500 such entities, compared to thousands in the West. There is no precise number available, given the private ownership structure and secrecy around these businesses. 
They offer a one-stop solution to managing the wealth of the rich, including investments, charitable giving, taxation and wealth transfer. Staffed by bankers, fund managers, lawyers and tax practitioners, some even provide overseas private schooling and travel arrangements as add-on services.
The rich are favoring family offices as they get personalized attention and are able to have a bigger say in their wealth management.
""This year the activity for setting up family offices is definitely more,"" said Lee Wong, Swiss private bank Lombard Odier Asia's head of family services. ""The growth of family offices in Asia should continue on its current trajectory.""
Asia Pacific had 814 billionaires at end-2017, accounting for 38 percent of the global billionaire population, with China minting two new billionaires every week, a report by UBS and PwC said last month.
That momentum was aided by the boom in Hong Kong for initial public offerings which saw a record $27.7 billion raised in the first nine months of 2017 mostly by Chinese tech firms, turning many founders into millionaires and billionaires.
Six private bankers on average estimated the number of new family offices in Asia had risen 15 percent in the first three quarters of this year over the year-ago period. This could pick up pace with a worldwide wealth transition of $3.4 trillion expected over the next two decades, as per the UBS/PwC report. 
BULKING UP
Asian family offices are evolving from being just investment focused to offering a platform for dispute resolution and succession planning, as the new generation in the family-owned businesses expand into newer areas, bankers said.
Buoyed by the growth prospects, private bank units of global firms including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC, and UBS are looking to expand family office services, headhunters and bankers said.
Stephen Campbell, chairman of the global family office group at Citi Private Bank, which serves over 1,500 family offices globally, said the bank had seen ""dramatic growth"" in the number of its clients, including in Asia.
Citi plans to make a new Hong Kong-based hire in its Asia Pacific family offices team, he said.
Credit Suisse's Asia Pacific head of wealth planning Bernard Fung said due to the surging demand from North Asia for family offices the bank would set up a team for this service in Hong Kong by the first quarter of 2019, adding to its Singapore hub.
""Offshore Chinese wealth will continue to grow, so family offices business is going to be a multi-year trend,"" said Ivan Wong, co-head for North Asia at HSBC Private Banking.
HSBC Asia private bank will add 700 people by 2022, and some of those new hires will focus on family office clients, he said.
UBS declined to comment.
Some of the regional financial firms are also looking to grab a bigger share of the business. 
Bank of Singapore plans to hire six more bankers for a team set up in May to provide support to independent asset managers, including family offices in Hong Kong, said Derrick Tan, its global market head of Greater China and North Asia.
INCENTIVES
The increased activity is also being helped by tax exemptions and other incentives offered by Hong Kong and Singapore.
The number of family offices in Singapore quadrupled between 2015 and 2017, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in response to a Reuters query, adding those funds can avail of ""fund tax exemption schemes"" if they satisfy the conditions. 
The city-state was depicted as a playground for the super-rich in the Hollywood hit film ""Crazy Rich Asians"".
Singapore Economic Development Board's assistant managing director Kelvin Wong said European families were also keen to access growth opportunities in Asia by establishing satellite family offices in the region.
Hong Kong plans to introduce a new structure that will offer ""more flexibility and choices"" in setting up funds, including those managed by family offices, said a spokesman for the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau. 

""The regulators have been very welcoming to family offices setting up here because that creates spinoffs for the economy as well,"" said Dawn Quek, a tax principal at Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow in Singapore.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 05:46AM ET</span>",SoftBank's Son defends Saudi ties as kingdom-backed fund boosts profit,"By Sam Nussey and Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) CEO Masayoshi Son on Monday condemned the killing of a journalist by Saudi security personnel, and said his firm must carry out its responsibility to the kingdom's citizens whose money is invested in its Vision Fund.
Saudi Arabia is the largest investor in the fund which was launched last year with over $90 billion in capital, giving Son firepower to make big bets in late-stage startups such as shared office space provider WeWork Cos and hotel chain OYO hotels.
Global outcry over the murder case, however, has led many observers to regard that dependence as a risk to SoftBank's plans to raise further funds.
""These funds are important to the Saudi people in ensuring their economy diversifies and is no longer dependent on oil,"" Son said on Monday.
""It is true that a horrible incident happened. On the other hand, we have a responsibility toward the Saudi people, and we must carry out our responsibility rather than turn our backs on them.""
Son was presenting SoftBank's earnings results, appearing before reporters for the first time since Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critical of the Saudi state, was murdered early last month in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
SoftBank booked July-September operating profit of 705.7 billion yen ($6.23 billion), helped by higher valuations on high-tech bets by the Saudi-backed Vision Fund. That compared with 395.6 billion yen a year earlier under different accounting standards. 
(Click for graphic showing the Vision Fund's growing contribution to SoftBank profit https://tmsnrt.rs/2RAwtfI)
Son said there was no indication SoftBank's Saudi links are deterring startups from accepting capital, with internet-connected window company View on Friday announcing a $1.1 billion investment from the Vision Fund.
And there are still plans to raise further funds, Son said, though he emphasized SoftBank would proceed cautiously and is waiting for the outcome of the Khashoggi case.
Worries about the Saudi fallout and a broader downturn in global technology stocks have weighed on SoftBank shares. They closed on Monday at 8,747 yen, down 24 percent from September's high of 11,500 yen.
IPO WORRIES
Another recent concern has been the planned initial public offering (IPO) of SoftBank's domestic mobile phone unit amid government pressure on Japan's telecommunications industry to lower prices. 
Market participants said the offering could surpass the record $25 billion worth of shares sold by China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) in New York in 2014.

The IPO will mark the transformation of SoftBank from a domestic telco, which successfully challenged the country's incumbent duopoly, into one of the world's biggest technology investors.
While the offering is expected to draw Japan's cash-rich retail investors attracted to SoftBank's image as a successful tech company and the prospect of steady returns, it comes as the government pushes for lower fees. 
Against that backdrop, NTT Docomo Inc (T:9437) said last week it will cut service charges by as much as 40 percent, affecting its earnings from the next fiscal year.
Separately, competition is set to increase as e-commerce giant  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) enters the mobile market in a year's time with the help of a tie-up with telco KDDI Corp (T:9433).
Son shrugged off such concerns on Monday, saying he wanted to keep growing sales and profit at SoftBank's mobile unit and pay a high dividend. 
Even so, in the face of that government pressure, SoftBank will increase automation and reduce headcount in mobile operations by 40 percent over the next two to three years focusing instead on new growth areas, Son said. 
The unit serves as the gateway for many of SoftBank's portfolio companies into Japan, operating joint ventures such as shared offices with WeWork, taxi hailing with China's Didi Chuxing, and a QR code payments business using technology from India's Paytm.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",French retailers rally round consumers irked by rising fuel prices,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's top two hypermarket chains Leclerc and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said they would sell petrol at relatively cheap prices this month, in response to anger at government plans for a fuel tax, which critics say will hit consumers' spending power.
Carrefour said on Monday that its special offer on petrol prices would run between now and Nov. 17, while Leclerc's similar offer will run until the end of the month.
The government has set the fuel tax in order to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. 
President Emmanuel Macron has also defended the rising price of fuel at the pumps, which have prompted activists to plan protest blockades on Nov. 17 across France, stating they are due mostly to rising oil prices.
Consumers' anger over the fuel tax is the latest sign of discontent facing Macron.
France's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party jumped ahead of Macron's LREM for the first time in a poll of voting intentions for May 2019 European Parliament elections.

Macron's standing in opinion polls has also been hit by the departure of two high-profile ministers, while stubbornly high unemployment, high taxes and rising fuel prices have added to signs of malaise.

509,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","As Election Anxiety Returns, Wall Street Plans to Get Defensive","(Bloomberg) -- Kevin Giddis doesn’t expect much in the way of surprises from the U.S. midterm elections. But then again, that’s what he thought two years ago as well.
That fateful night, Giddis, head of fixed-income capital markets at Raymond James & Associates, went to a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game -- Hillary Clinton’s presidential victory all but assured. By the time he got back to the firm’s office a few hours later, the market chaos was already in full effect.
“You just want to avoid getting hit in the head” this time around, said Giddis, who, like much of Wall Street, was caught off guard as global markets convulsed following Donald Trump’s upset win in the presidential vote. Giddis plans to pare back his bets against Treasuries ahead of the election, which he considers his most vulnerable wager should the Democratic Party perform well Tuesday.
The midterms come at a time when ballots globally -- from Brazil to Italy to the U.K. -- are reshaping the course of policy and fueling major shifts in market sentiment. Add to that declining confidence in the ability of polling to predict electoral outcomes, and it’s easy to see why traders are getting anxious once again.
‘Ready to Respond’
According to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a roughly 6 in 7 chance of recapturing the House, while Republicans have a similar likelihood of maintaining control of the Senate -- signifying even longer odds for an upset than in 2016. A survey of market participants from  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank found that most expected stocks, bond yields and the dollar to post small declines on a narrow Democratic House victory, respondents’ base case scenario.
Yet even though he doesn’t anticipate any carnage Tuesday, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, isn’t taking any chances.
“We will be there at the office, we’ll be by our telephones,’’ said Golub, who has cleared his calendar and expects clients will start calling once the results come in. “The most important thing I can do is not over-schedule myself that day so I am ready to respond if the market is agitated.”
Abroad, midterm angst is less intense, partly as investors remain preoccupied with major risk events at home, and partly on the view that the market implications are simply less extreme than they were two years ago, even in the case of an upset.
In Frankfurt,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) foreign-exchange strategist Esther Reichelt said that her team is eschewing the night shift they adopted for the 2016 election.
“It’s only a midterm election, and the most extreme outcome – a Democratic House and Senate – isn’t likely to shock markets,” said Neil Staines, a portfolio manager at Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd.
DWS Group, a German money manager with about $800 billion in assets, will have a skeleton crew in the New York office just in case, according to Greg Staples, co-head of Americas fixed income.
But Staples had a warning for those staying up: “That first reaction at 2 a.m. tends to be the wrong reaction,” he said."

512,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 04:47AM ET</span>","Japan's Subaru recalls more cars, slashes guidance as cheating issue widens","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Subaru Corp (T:7270) said it would recall more vehicles sold in the domestic market on new cases of inspection cheating, and cautioned that rising recall costs would lop off about a quarter from its annual profit forecast.
Shares in Subaru, already reeling from a series of recalls for issues ranging from faulty components to inspection do-overs, fell 5 percent to a four-year low on Monday after news of the fresh recalls and the bleak outlook.
The company, the smallest among Japan's major automakers, said it would recall around 100,000 vehicles, including its popular Impreza sedan after discovering that final tests for components including brakes were not conducted properly. Vehicles sold overseas will not be affected.
""It's unforgivable that these inspection-related issues are continuing,"" CEO Tomomi Nakamura said at a briefing, while repeatedly adding that the latest recall would be the last related to testing misconduct.
The automaker expects to incur 6.5 billion yen ($57 million) in costs related to the latest recall. This, along with other quality-linked issues, is expected to push Subaru's operating profit to 220 billion yen in the year to March 2019. It had previously forecast a 300 billion yen profit.
Subaru posted a surprise operating loss of 25 billion yen for the three months ended September, its first time in the red for a quarter since 2009 and missing a mean forecast for a 68.46 billion yen profit from 10 analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
Recall-related costs were the main driver of the loss, while global sales fell 6 percent over the quarter due to weak demand in the United States - its biggest market where overall demand has cooled since record-high sales in 2016.
(Click here for an interactive chart on Subaru's operating results https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ru9Edl)
PAINFUL ENGINE-RELATED RECALL
Last month, Subaru nearly halved its first-half operating profit view, citing higher quality-related costs. It later announced a global recall of around 400,000 vehicles, including its Forester SUV and Impreza sedan, to fix a design flaw in the engines' valve springs.
That came on the heels of another series of recalls stemming from revelations last year that uncertified workers had been submitting final inspection reports for vehicles sold in Japan. That had also led to a recall of about 400,000 cars.
Recalls are common in the auto industry and automakers regularly put funds aside to pay for them. 
But Subaru expects it will need more cash to cover the recall costs - particularly for its distinctive, horizontally placed boxer engines, which have a loyal following among racing enthusiasts, as it involves time-consuming replacements.
""I have already heard from overseas that this recall could hit our brand image,"" Nakamura said.
U.S. WOES
Shares of Subaru, which so far has not been able to improve compliance at its plants, have shed almost 20 percent this year, on track for a third straight annual drop - pressured also by bleaker prospects in the United States.
The firm has for years managed to rake in higher sales in the United States with advertisements featuring slogans such as love, inclusion and safety helping it win over consumers. But its U.S. sales have plateaued since last year, snapping a five-year winning streak.
Subaru is also bracing for a possible hike in U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports, which would hurt it given it imports half of the vehicles it sells in the United States from Japan.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 09:45PM ET</span>",JPMorgan spreads its urban development money to Paris,"By David Henry and Inti Landauro
NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Sunday that it has selected impoverished areas around Paris as the first foreign focus of an urban economic development strategy it started four years ago in Detroit.
The bank will contribute $30 million over five years to programs to teach job skills and expand small businesses in Seine-Saint-Denis and other places with high unemployment and poverty, JPMorgan said in a statement provided to Reuters.
Located north of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis has the highest poverty and crime rates in France. Dotted with large social housing projects, the area is separated from wealthy Paris only by an extremely congested highway circling the city. The area was in the center of the riots that devastated suburbs all over France a decade ago.
CEO Jamie Dimon planned to follow the announcement with a visit to the city on Tuesday. Dimon has been leaving more day-to-day operations of the New York-based bank to lieutenants while he promotes policies and public-private partnerships which he believes will promote economic growth.
His advocacy work has been primarily in the United States where JPMorgan earns about 80 percent of its revenue.
The Paris effort is part of JPMorgan's ""Advancing Cities"" program, which builds on investments of $150 million in Detroit and $40 million in Chicago, cities where JPMorgan has the biggest market share of bank deposits.
JPMorgan executives have said they want more business abroad, particularly commercial lending to mid-sized companies.
JPMorgan employs about 200 people in France among some 255,000 worldwide.
JPMorgan employees in Paris work in investment banking, money management and capital markets. They do not serve low-income individuals or small businesses who could be the first to benefit from the new effort.
Peter Scher, JPMorgan Head of Corporate Responsibility, said the program will provide workers the skills needed by the bank's business clients, some of which are in office towers near areas where unemployment rates reach 35 percent.
""That is a good bet for the economy and it is a good bet for our firm,"" said Scher.
The job training will focus on the construction, information technology and environmental sustainability industries which are important in France, he said.
The $30 million for Paris is part of $500 million JPMorgan said in September that it would spend in as many as 30 cities, including some outside of the United States.

JPMorgan reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion.

525,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",The Worst May Not Be Over for Philippine Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Wednesday marked the first day of foreign investments into Philippine equity funds after a record streak of withdrawals. But overseas traders remain skeptical.
The net $4.3 million inflow is just a drop in the ocean compared with the $422 million that fled the nation’s stock funds in the previous 44 days. Despite a 17 percent plunge in the Philippine equity index this year, the shares are still expensive relative to their Asian peers, and estimates for corporate-earnings growth aren’t appealing enough, according to Aberdeen Asset Management’s regional branch,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Banca del Sempione SA.
“Most markets have taken a beating so it’s very difficult to make the Philippines stand out because everything else is attractive,” said Bharat Joshi, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “The story is still good, but valuation has to be taken into context given the headwinds ahead.”
The Philippine Stock Exchange Index has become one of the world’s worst-performing equity indexes this year amid a sinking peso, rising inflation and economic growth that’s slowed to a three-year low. With the U.S. expansion on a strong path and the Federal Reserve raising rates, foreign outflows from the Philippines may continue after the market lured money in eight of the last 10 years, Joshi said.
Wednesday’s inflow was due to investors hunting for bargains after a strong beating, according to Jonathan Ravelas, the chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. Any market rebound will get temporary support from a strengthening peso and drop in commodity prices, he added. The currency posted its biggest jump in almost a year last month on speculation inflation is reaching a peak as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Assistant Governor Francis Dakila said consumer prices are likely to begin easing.
Cheuk Wan Fan, the head of investment strategy for Asia at HSBC Private Bank, said she’s keeping a two-year-old neutral rating on Philippine shares, citing bleak economic data, modest earnings growth, high valuations and the lack of support from dividend yields. She sees a bit of respite possibly coming in mid-2019, with a slower appreciation of the U.S. dollar and peak in U.S. interest rates.
But for now, Philippine shares may suffer some more as investors may keep pulling money from the market amid Fed tightening and rising bond yields, according to Federico Parenti, who helps manage $1.3 billion at Sempione Sim SpA in Milan.
“Money needs a nice reward to be back,” he said. “Philippine market valuations are not so compelling yet, and the currency is not stable. Many bottlenecks in infrastructure make it not the favorite location for investment, so many investors are looking to re-allocate their assets elsewhere.”

526,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 06:21PM ET</span>","How Hyundai Motor, once a rising star, lost its shine","By Hyunjoo Jin, Ben Klayman and Yilei Sun
SEOUL/DETROIT/CHONGQING, China (Reuters) - At a near-empty  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) showroom in the Chinese mega city of Chongqing, the store manager is grumbling about his shortage of customers and a lack of bigger, cheaper SUV models popular in the world's largest auto market.
Even with discounting of as much as 25 percent, his dealership was selling barely a hundred vehicles a month, said the manager surnamed Li. A nearby Nissan (T:7201) dealership was selling about 400 vehicles a month, a store manager there said.
""The sales are simply poor,"" Li told Reuters. ""Look at the Nissan store next door, they have tens of customers while we just have two.""
An hour's drive away is Hyundai's massive $1 billion manufacturing plant, which opened last year with a target to produce 300,000 vehicles per year.
But with sales weak and the Chinese auto market slowing sharply, the factory is running at roughly 30 percent of capacity, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The sources asked not to be identified because the information was not public. Hyundai, the world's 5th largest automaker, declined to comment on the Chongqing plant's production or the showroom's sales but said it is ""closely cooperating"" with local partner BAIC (HK:1958) to turn around the China business. BAIC did not respond to requests for comment.
Hyundai's woes mark a major reversal for the automaker which was an early success story in China as it quickly and cheaply rolled out popular new models into a surging market.
In 2009, Hyundai and partner Kia's combined sales ranked third in China after General Motors (N:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
The South Korean duo now ranks ninth and its market share in China has more than halved to 4 percent last year, from more than 10 percent at the beginning of this decade.
Executives and industry experts say Hyundai conceded its once stronghold in the low-end segment to fast-growing Chinese rivals such as Geely (HK:0175) and BYD (HK:1211). 
Foreign rivals not only defended their turf in premium segments but also kept pricing competitive for mass-market models, squeezing Hyundai's positioning as an affordable foreign brand, they said.
In the United States, the world's second-biggest auto market, Hyundai's market share fell to 4 percent last year, near a decade low. 
Hyundai ran into problems in China and the United States for similar reasons: It missed shifts in consumer tastes, especially the surge in demand for SUVs, and it sought higher prices than its brand image could command, four Chinese dealers and half a dozen former and current U.S. dealers, executives and employees said.  
In a statement to Reuters, Hyundai said it is addressing its problems in its key U.S. and Chinese markets, revamping designs, launching new SUVs and giving regional units more autonomy to quickly develop products tailored to local tastes. 
WRONG PRODUCTS, WRONG PRICES
Japanese rivals such as Honda (T:7267), long a role model for the Korean automaker, have also struggled to adapt to the industry's emerging challenges including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.
Last month, Hyundai posted a 68 percent plunge in third-quarter net profit and reported its operating margin shrank to 2.7 percent in the January-September period. In 2011, Hyundai's operating margin of 10.3 percent was the industry's highest after Germany's BMW.Hyundai's lack of a strong SUV line-up in key markets has also hurt.
Last year, SUVs accounted for just 36 percent of Hyundai's U.S. sales, compared to GM's 76 percent and the industry average of 63 percent, according to U.S. market research firm Autodata Corp data.
""One of our challenges back then, and I know it would continue to be a challenge, was that the management at (headquarters) was really big on sedans,"" said Ed Kim, a Hyundai U.S. product manager between 2004-2008 who is now vice president for California-based auto consultancy Auto Pacific.
""(U.S.) product planning staff, marketing staff really wanted more truck products, more SUVs, but in so many cases, it was very difficult to convince management.""
Hyundai America Chief Operating Officer Brian Smith acknowledged the automaker was ""caught a little off guard"" with a rapid market shift toward big vehicles. 
But a slew of new planned SUVs including a ""crossover"" pickup truck in 2020 will help drive a “slow, steady” recovery in sales, Smith told Reuters in an interview.
Hyundai has also in recent years hired several new designers to revamp design for next-generation models, he said.
Asked if Hyundai will be able to return to its record market share of 5.1 percent in 2011, Smith said: “It’s going to take a few years."" 
DESIGN DIALLED DOWN
Hyundai made a crucial mis-step with its flagship Sonata sedan four years ago when it decided to dial back distinctive design features including its sporty, fluid curves. The redesign contributed to falling sales, U.S. dealers and former Hyundai executives said.
Scott Fink, who owns the biggest U.S. Hyundai dealer by volume, vividly recalls the moment when Hyundai brought about 20 U.S. dealers to its headquarters in Seoul to show off the new Sonata before its 2014 U.S. launch.
""I'll never forget it. They pulled the sheet off of it and there were 20 people in the room and not one person clapped,"" Florida-based Fink told Reuters.
The design was too conservative and mainstream, falling flat with dealers and consumers, he said.
""Then, more than anything else, it just became a price war,"" Fink said.
In 2007, the Sonata was 10 percent cheaper than Toyota's popular Camry sedan but by 2014 it cost more, according to U.S. market research firm Edmund.com. Hyundai, which sold nearly 200,000 Sonatas in the U.S. market in 2010, sold just 131,803 units last year. 
Hyundai did not comment on the design changes or the cool response to the unveiling of the Sonata design described by Fink. 
SALES SLUMP
Back in the Chinese city of Chongqing, dealers at four Hyundai showrooms visited by Reuters say the new Encino SUV, based on its small South Korean SUV Kona and launched this year in China, missed the mark. 
Global automakers often tweak designs for the Chinese market, adding features such as bigger, more luxurious rear passenger zones to cater to buyers, many of whom have drivers.
""We don't sell Encino. It simply doesn't fit the Chinese market,"" said another store manager surnamed Liu at one of Hyundai's first dealerships in Chongqing. ""Most Chinese prefer bigger, cheaper and prettier cars.""
Hyundai had a target of producing 60,000 Encinos a year, one source with direct knowledge of the matter said. But just over 6,000 Encinos have been sold in the six months since its April launch, regulatory filings show.
During a recent earnings call, vice president Koo Zayong said Hyundai will also shorten its development period for new models in China, where market trends are changing fast, driven by the rise of young customers.
Hyundai created a division dedicated to improving Chinese products in August, and replaced its China operation head in July. 
But the China recovery will likely be ""gradual"" given an economic slowdown and intensifying competition from rivals, Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters.
FATHER'S LEGACY
Company officials, dealers and analysts expect the task of leading a revival will fall heavily on Hyundai's third generation leader, Euisun Chung.
Chung, 48, was promoted to executive vice chairman in September, moving him a step closer to succeeding his octogenarian father and current chairman, Mong-koo Chung, who has been absent from public view and key internal meetings for the past two years.
The elder Chung is credited with catapulting Hyundai to the big leagues by drastically improving product quality and rapidly building production capacity at home and abroad. 
Under his tight grip over the sprawling conglomerate and centralized decision making, Hyundai shunned partnerships and made everything in-house, from steel to key components such as engines and transmissions.
But Hyundai also invested less than rivals in research and development. Last year, Hyundai Motor spent just 2.6 percent of its revenue on R&D, compared with 6.7 percent for Volkswagen, 3.8 percent for Toyota and 3.6 percent for BYD, according to their annual reports.
In a break from tradition, the younger Chung has been investing in start-ups, hiring outsiders and forming partnerships with self-driving tech firms and others. 
Last year, Hyundai appointed a chief innovation officer from Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) to oversee a division on ride-sharing, robotics and artificial intelligence. 
Euisun Chung has had some early setbacks. At the 2011 Detroit auto show, he unveiled Hyundai’s new brand vision - modern premium - to revamp its value for money image, and four years later announced the automaker's first premium brand, Genesis.
U.S. sales of Genesis fell 45 percent year-on-year to 9,281 vehicles from January to October. 
Chung declined an interview request from Reuters.
Nick Reilly, a former chief executive of GM Korea, told Reuters that Hyundai's brand image has certainly gone up but still is ""not anywhere near a premium brand"".
""So I think they have to go back to the mentality to be very price-competitive in order to maintain the volumes,"" he said.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>","Sears, chairman, lenders seek bankruptcy loan breakthrough: sources","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) is in discussions with Chairman Eddie Lampert and lenders on a deal to expand a bankruptcy financing package that would help it avoid liquidation, people familiar with the matter said.
The negotiations come at a critical time for Sears, as it needs enough money to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday shopping season and retain enough support from creditors and vendors to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. 
Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15 with a plan to close about 142 of its 700 stores by the end of the year, throwing into doubt the future of the 125-year-old retailer that once dominated U.S. malls but has withered in the age of internet shopping. 
Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, is weighing partnering with other potential lenders to contribute up to $450 million in bankruptcy financing in exchange for key collateral that Sears' banks currently hold, which includes some store leases, the sources said. 
In return for giving up their claims on the collateral, the banks would be given the opportunity to reduce their exposure to Sears by contributing $150 million to the bankruptcy financing, rather than the $300 million originally promised.
The maneuvers would have the combined effect of boosting the current overall bankruptcy-financing package from $300 million to up to $600 million.
The negotiations remain fluid and the contours of the deal, including the amount of money lenders would extend, could change, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. 
A Sears spokesman declined to comment.
Sears has had trouble raising additional financing beyond what banks originally promised. That is because ESL and other possible new lenders balked at providing as much as $300 million that would be second in line for repayment and lacked the desired collateral to back the loan, the sources said. 
The reworked loan under discussion aims to give Sears, which employs roughly 68,000 people, more breathing room to avoid liquidation and reorganize around a smaller set of stores expected to be put up for sale.
Sears has held discussions with ESL about bidding on roughly 400 financially healthier stores that executives believe could keep the retailer alive, according to court records. One of the sources said ESL is now weighing bidding on as many as 500 stores. ESL would be a so-called stalking-horse bidder in this scenario, submitting an initial bid that others could then attempt to top, according to court filings. 
The sources said that Sears is pursuing numerous options related to its bankruptcy financing.

A hearing to finalize Sears' bankruptcy financing is scheduled for Nov. 15, according to a court filing. A deadline for Sears to obtain a bidder for its stores is currently set for Dec. 15, according to court records.

The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) will be given an extra A$58.7 million ($42.2 million) over four years and Wayne Byres will remain its chairman until 2024, treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement.
The authority was criticized by the inquiry, called a Royal Commission, in September for its part in failing to pick up or punish problems across the industry ranging from billing the dead to aggressive loan selling.
The Commission found in its interim report that a culture of greed and widespread misconduct in the finance sector was allowed to develop, while APRA and the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, were too soft.
APRA rejected that criticism and said it was mandated o focus on material risks to banks' stability rather than their treatment of customers, but added its resources were tight.
The reappointment, announced nine months ahead of the expiry of Byres' current term, and the funding was ""important for stability during this time of reform"", Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
Byres was first appointed to head the regulator in 2014 and had worked there for 13 years between 1998 and 2011.
The Commission has shredded the finance sector's reputation and value, with some A$60 billion ($43 billion) wiped from the market capitalization of Australia's four largest banks and wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) since it was announced.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Wanted: An Australian energy policy to kickstart A$25 billion of investment,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Constant changes in Australia's government have convinced the country's power companies that its political leaders will never craft a coherent and long-lasting national energy policy that is needed to keep the lights on.
Years of energy policy flip-flops are holding up billions of dollars of investment in new generation and transmission even as Australia looks to prevent a repeat of blackouts suffered over the past two years. The lack of reliability is occurring even as the country pays some of the highest electricity costs in the industrialized world.
With six different prime ministers and a change in the ruling party since 2010, Australia's power companies have been whipsawed between competing political visions for the country's energy markets, particularly over the type of power generation and whether to address carbon emissions.
""Changes of government in Australia have led to vastly different energy policy environments due to the absence of bipartisan consensus on what the appropriate energy mix should be and to what extent climate change should be tackled,"" said Peter Kiernan, an energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The policy vacuum is occurring at a crucial time for Australia.
As much as A$25 billion ($18 billion) will be needed for a mix of wind and solar farms, hydroelectric power, batteries and transmission lines as well as natural gas-fired power to keep the lights on, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said.
Yet investors tired of the flip-flopping are hesitant to back projects amid the uncertainty. 
""Twenty-five billion dollars is a lot of money to put at risk when we don't really know what the rules are going to be,"" said Sam Magee, head of commercial for EnergyAustralia, Australia's third-largest power producer.
New Prime Minister Scott Morrison assumed leadership of the ruling Liberal party after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as coal supporters in the party thought his National Energy Guarantee (NEG) policy favored renewable energy.
On Oct. 23, Energy Minister Angus Taylor revived some but not all of the NEG policies. He also invited generation developers to apply to the government to underwrite projects for so-called firm power capacity such as coal-fired plants and firmed capacity which includes solar or wind projects tied to back up power sources such as batteries or standby hydroelectric sites known as pumped hydro.
To address blackout concerns, the government proposed instituting a retailer reliability obligation that will require power retailers and big energy users to line up enough power to meet their needs if the market operator identifies predicted shortfalls that have not been filled a year in advance. 
It also launched a plan to introduce ""default power prices"", effectively a price cap, to keep a lid on household electricity prices which have soared 56 percent over the past 10 years.
Price caps may be popular with consumers, but not for financiers and developers of new capacity. 
""We continue to caution against a return to price regulation as it will stifle investment right at the time we need it to maintain a secure electricity supply for customers as we replace aging coal plants and transition to a lower emissions future,"" Origin Energy, Australia's top power retailer, said in emailed comments.

Carbon policy was absent from Taylor's proposals which will create more uncertainty for investors. 
The shifting carbon policy of the past decade has deterred investment in natural gas and coal-fired power stations. The opposition Labor party has called for a 45 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2030. The NEG contained a target of 26 percent but that was dropped after the plan failed.
Australia's biggest power producers, led by AGL Energy, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, owned by Hong Kong's CLP Holdings, all have gas-fired and pumped hydro projects awaiting final sign-offs which partly hinge on what the government does next.
Yet, more uncertainty is likely as the Liberal-National government is expected to lose to the Labor Party in the next elections, due by May 2019.
The power producers themselves are accepting of a lower carbon future but need more certainty for their plans to replace Australia's ageing coal-fired power plants over the next 20 years, said the EIU's Kiernan. 
""For this to occur, however, requires implementation of policies that are durable and able to last beyond one election cycle,"" he said.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 01:05PM ET</span>","To make more Ram trucks, Fiat Chrysler reconsiders Mexico","( Fiat  Chrysler corrects pricing data in paragraph 16 to provide a more accurate comparison between FCA and Ford pickup trucks, in October 29th story)
By Nick Carey
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (MI:FCHA) new CEO is tired of being No. 3 in U.S. pickup truck sales.
With a strategy of loading up its revamped Ram 1500 full-size trucks with new features - ranging from 12-inch touch screens on the dashboard to large battery packs and electric motors to help adjust speed and gears and conserve fuel - the automaker is banking on a sustained surge in demand. 
So Chief Executive Mike Manley is now reconsidering a decision announced in January to stop building Ram heavy-duty pickups at a plant in Saltillo, Mexico. That plant, and another in Warren, Michigan, between them would produce other Ram models and free up manufacturing capacity to make even more new trucks to eat into sales of Ford Motor Co's (N:F) F-Series or General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet Silverado, and its higher-end GMC Sierra.
""We need to get ourselves into second"" place, Manley told Reuters exclusively in his first interview since taking over the No. 7 global automaker after Sergio Marchionne died suddenly. ""Frankly, I don't care which of the two I take share from.""
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pw99lX 
When U.S. President Donald Trump was threatening action that would have imposed a 25 percent tariff on Mexican-made pickup trucks earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler said Saltillo would be ""repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles.""
In 2017, Marchionne had raised the possibility his company could move heavy-duty pickup production out of Saltillo, saying U.S. tax and trade policy would influence the decision. 
Now, the United States, Mexico and Canada have a tentative trade agreement that imposes no ceiling on shipments of pickups to the United States from Mexico, provided they meet thresholds for the share of parts produced within the region.
""With a combination of Warren and Mexico building what we call the classic truck, we have enough production to increase output next year if it’s required,"" Manley said. 
""In my opinion it will be required. We are gaining share. Obviously I am looking for that to continue, but it's an incredibly competitive segment,"" he added.
The Ram and Jeep brands underpin the automaker's North American business - which accounted for nearly 85 percent of Fiat Chrysler's second-quarter pre-tax profit - and offset the struggles of its legacy Fiat business in Europe and operations in China.
Ford's F-Series trucks have led the segment for four decades. In 2017, Ford had a 35.6 percent share of U.S. retail truck sales, followed closely by GM at 34.2 percent and FCA with 22.3 percent.
Pickup trucks are the single biggest contributor to the Detroit Big Three automakers' profits, so there is plenty at stake as they fight for market share.
In the battle for pickup customers, GM launched a new version of its Silverado truck designed with a focus on slashing weight and trimming production costs to compete with market leader Ford.
Fiat Chrysler, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, took a different tack with the new Ram. The automaker stuffed more features into the vehicle - including an optional 12-inch touch screen and partial electrification that saves fuel and helps with acceleration and cruise control - on a bet that customers would pay more in return.
So far, the gamble appears to be paying off. The new Ram 1500's average sale price for the year to date through late October hit $46,856, - higher than the $42,389 average for the Ford F-150, according to industry data. Though in FCA's case the data only involves the higher-end versions of the 2019 Ram 1500 that are available so far, but all versions of the F-150.
Hayden Elder, owner of Elder Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Athens, Texas, said three times in under a month he has had families trade in nearly-new large SUVs made by FCA's rivals for a new Ram 1500.
""This new Ram is the biggest leap I've ever seen from one version to another,"" Elder said. About 70 percent of the 800 vehicles he sells annually are trucks.
""HAVEN'T FOUND THE CEILING YET"" 
Phil Jansen, Fiat Chrysler's head of product development, said when his team began redesigning the Ram 1500, they decided a lighter, all-aluminum body - which Ford uses for its trucks - was too expensive. GM executives reached the same conclusion. 
But Fiat Chrysler took a chance that GM did not, and added a large battery pack and electric motor that assist with acceleration and shifting, plus deliver a smooth start-stop function that idles the engine when stopped in traffic, boosting fuel economy. 
""It can save about this much fuel at an average stop,"" said FCA electrification manager Brian Spohn, holding up a small tumbler of water. 
The decision to offer a larger dashboard screen than its rivals have came late in the design process. Initially, the big screen was offered in the top three of the truck's six versions. Fiat Chrysler has since decided to offer it on an additional version. 
Demand is so high, the company has pushed the screen's supplier for as many screens as it can provide, according to a source familiar with production plans.
""We haven't found the ceiling yet"" for what U.S. customers are willing to pay for additional features, said Jim Morrison, head of the Ram brand in North America. 
Fiat Chrysler had problems earlier this year accelerating production of the new Ram truck on a highly-automated production line installed at a Detroit-area plant that previously made slow-selling sedans. 
Among the problems: Dropped bolts and other debris would shut down automated vehicles that carried truck frames through part of the assembly process. The solution was to put debris-sweeping skirts on the carriers, FCA executives said on a recent tour of the plant. 
Now, the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant is cranking out around 65 trucks an hour, 20 hours a day, six days a week - a pace of about 400,000 vehicles per year.
""It is capable, if we wanted to, to push it up more from there,"" Manley told Reuters. ""Clearly, having the capacity to fulfill our ambitions is important.""

536,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","Emirates seeks Rolls-Royce A380 engine deal, nothing finalised","DUBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Emirates is edging towards a deal with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) to power its latest Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 superjumbos but has not yet reached a final agreement, the Dubai-based airline said on Sunday.
The fate of a lifeline order for up to 36 of the double-decker aircraft, of which Emirates already has over 100 in operation, has been widely questioned due to inconclusive talks over a separate deal between Emirates and engine makers.
""We are getting closer (to a deal with Rolls-Royce) but have not crossed the line yet,"" a spokesperson for the Dubai-based carrier said, asked about the status of negotiations with the British engine maker.
A French newspaper last week reported the two sides had reached an agreement.
Industry sources have said Emirates is unhappy with the performance of Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on A380s already in service and that a shortfall in efficiency has meant Rolls-Royce having to pay hefty penalties.
To improve performance and avoid such penalties in future, Rolls-Royce would need to put more R&D spending into the engine at a time when it is mired in delays or reliability problems on engines for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and the Airbus A330neo.
Engine Alliance, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Pratt & Whitney that until recently had provided engines for Emirates' A380 fleet, has shown little interest in reviving output. 
Its parent companies are tackling restructuring at GE and delays on smaller Pratt & Whitney engines, industry sources say.
Airline president Tim Clark has reportedly denied suggestions that the airline is slowing down taking delivery of existing A380s, saying delays are due to production problems.
""Unfortunately, quite a few of the A380 deliveries have slipped and they are all compressed in the back end of the year in the next two months, so we are taking them now,"" he told the Airline Ratings website.
Reuters reported last week that there were delays in delivering some A380s to Emirates and quoted one source as saying Emirates did not need them for now and had parked a number as part of efforts to manage capacity.
Durability problems affecting Roll-Royce's Trent 1000 engine have resulted in premature repairs and led to as many as 40 or so Boeing 787s being idle at any time, industry sources say.

The crisis has had a knock-on effect on other programs as Rolls diverts production capacity from the similar Trent 7000 engine, resulting in delays to the Airbus A330neo.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that his favorite measure of success, the stock market, is imperiled if voters favor Democrats in next week's congressional elections.
While not fully accurate - stocks tend to rise regardless of who controls the government - it does bear out that the market has delivered a slightly stronger performance on average when Republicans dominate in Washington.
A Reuters analysis of the past half century shows stocks fared better in the two calendar years after congressional elections when Republicans control Congress and the presidency than when Democrats controlled the two branches, and at least as well as during times of gridlock. Many investors are now hoping for a continuation of the Republican agenda. 
""There is Trump 'the person', who is very controversial,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""And there's also Trump 'the agenda'. The Trump agenda, the stock market loves. To the extent it continues, the market will like that.""
Republicans traditionally push pro-business policies such as tax cuts and deregulation, which boost stock prices. The market has, on the whole, given Trump a thumbs-up, with the market rising almost 20 percent during his presidency so far.
Polls show strong chances that the Democratic Party may win control of the House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 midterm elections after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with Republicans likely to keep the Senate.
Trump warned in a tweet on Tuesday that a change in Congress would be bad for the market, saying: ""If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat.""
Investors often favor Washington gridlock because it preserves the status quo and reduces uncertainty.
""Traditionally, gridlock is good for the markets. But I think this election is very tricky; I'm not sure that's the preferred market outcome because a lot of the benefits of the past two years have come from not being in a gridlock environment,"" said Mike O'Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading.
Should his fellow Republicans maintain or extend their grip on Congress, Trump may be emboldened to pursue more of his political agenda, including further tax overhauls.
By contrast, Democratic gains that allow the party to control the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate, could stifle Trump's policy aims and perhaps lead to attempts to impeach him. It could also lead to resistance to increasing the government's debt limit next year.
""Our economists believe that two likely consequences of a divided Congress would be an increase in investigations and uncertainty surrounding fiscal deadlines, which could raise equity volatility,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a report this week.
Over the past 50 years, gridlock has been the norm rather than the exception in Washington, with the presidency and Congress won by one party in just seven out of 25 congressional election years.
GRAPHIC: Wall Street and Washington - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P57hRu
Looking at the two calendar years following each congressional election, the S&P 500 had a mean annual increase of 12 percent under Republican-controlled governments, compared to an increase of 9 percent for Democrat-controlled governments and a 7 percent rise for gridlocked governments.
However, using median averages, which exclude outliers, differences are less clear, with the S&P 500 seeing annual increases of 11 percent under Republican-controlled governments and under gridlock, and 10 percent gains under Democrat-controlled governments.
An analysis by BTIG brokerage of data going back to 1928 also indicates gridlock is not necessarily ideal. It showed U.S. stocks performing better under united governments.
""While government control is by no means the sole determinant of market performance, investors clearly favor a unified regime,"" BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel wrote in his report.
Interest rates, economic growth, company earnings and inflation are widely viewed as strong influences on stock prices, making the balance of power in Washington just one of many factors affecting investor sentiment. 
Two Democratic presidents - Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - have presided over the strongest S&P 500 performances http://tmsnrt.rs/2jtEpzi since 1952, with gains of 208 percent and 166 percent, respectively.
Wall Street has applauded Trump since he took power in January 2017 and quickly pushed through measures to deregulate banks and other companies. Last December, his Republican party passed sweeping corporate tax cuts that have S&P 500 companies on track this year to grow their earnings per share by over 20 percent, the biggest jump since 2010, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

""Volatility may rise regardless of the outcome, but, based on historical relationships, equities may be more likely to rise if Republicans manage to maintain control of Congress,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a recent report.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:05AM ET</span>","BlackRock's Fink says U.S., China on path to full-fledged trade war","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday the United States is on a path to a full-fledged trade war against China as the world's two largest economies engage in tit-for-tat tariffs.
Fink is one of the most influential figures in global finance, who keeps up relations with politicians in many countries as leader of the world's largest fund manager, overseeing $6.4 trillion in assets from sovereign debt to corporate equity.
""If the path remains the same in the next few weeks, we're going to have a full-fledged trade war,"" Fink said at the New York Times Co's DealBook conference.
""China is a very strong, very proud nation. I think they're going to stand pretty firm."" 
The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.
U.S. President Donald Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies.
In a tweet on Thursday Trump said he had a ""very good"" talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea and that the two planned to meet at the G20 summit in Argentina which starts at the end of this month. 
Fink said he had traveled to China in recent weeks and defined a ""full-fledged trade war"" as meaning U.S. levies on all Chinese imports.
He said China will likely not buy more U.S. Treasuries as the trade war goes on. That would put pressure on Washington, which has financed its growing debt by selling bonds, often to China and other foreign governments.
Just days after a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Fink said his company has privately engaged with gun makers on how they plan to respond to the social backlash from mass shootings.
BlackRock is the largest shareholder in several gun makers through its massive index funds, which generally hold shares in all companies in a certain index. 

Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make ""a positive contribution to society"" in addition to delivering financial performance, as his company faces such demands from shareholders and customers.

The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)revoked licenses for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell passenger jets to Iran after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement in May and reimposed sanctions.
""We welcome any (company) which is able to provide the planes needed by IranAir. We even have gone after planes such as Sukhoi 100 or planes made by non-European countries,"" said IranAir Chief Executive Farzaneh Sharafbafi, quoted by Iran's Roads Ministry website.
Most modern commercial planes have more than 10 percent in U.S. parts, the threshold for needing U.S. Treasury approval. But Russian officials have been reported as saying Sukhoi is working on reducing the number of U.S. parts in the hopes of winning an Iranian order for up to 100 aircraft.
""We will consider plane purchases if these companies can sell planes to Iran without an OFAC license, and are willing to negotiate,"" Sharafbafi added. She gave no further details.
IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft - 100 from Airbus, 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals were dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>","Buffett's Berkshire doubles profit, repurchases $900 million stock in third quarter","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, on Saturday said its quarterly operating profit doubled as its insurance business dodged hurricanes and benefited from lower taxes.
The strong result gives Buffett more cash to deploy even as the well-known bargain-hunting ""value"" investor has admitted struggling to find a place to put those earnings to work and resorted to buying back $928 million in his own company's stock in the latest quarter.
Operating profit in the third quarter doubled to $6.88 billion from $3.44 billion a year earlier, and higher than the $6.11 billion expected by Wall Street, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Helping the company's insurance operations were lower estimated liabilities from property and casualty insurance in prior years and lower taxes. The year prior included major losses due to three U.S. hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico.
Insurance underwriting income was $441 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion in the year-ago period.
""This is absolutely one of the biggest quarterly earnings reports that has ever come out of a United States corporation,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management, a Berkshire shareholder.
Berkshire said third-quarter net income rose more than 355 percent to $18.5 billion, though that reflected a new accounting rule requiring it to report unrealized investment gains with earnings. Buffett said the rule could lead to ""wild and capricious"" results and can mislead investors, who should look at operating profit instead.
Berkshire's effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.2 percent compared to 25.3 percent in the year-ago period following a reduction of the corporate tax rate that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Many U.S. companies' reported results have been skewed by the law's impact.
OVER $100 BILLION TO SPEND
Insurance provides a stream of cash that Berkshire can invest around the world. Float, or insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, ended September at $118 billion. The company has $103.6 billion in cash, short-term Treasuries and other similar investments.
Buffett's last big acquisition was in January 2016, when Berkshire paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. In July, the company announced relaxing a policy that had effectively prevented Buffett from buying back the company's shares at current prices.
Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, chemicals, energy, food and retail, industrial parts, railroad and other sectors.
Their day-to-day operations are overseen by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, each seen by investors as a possible successor to Buffett, 88, as chief executive. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, handle major capital allocation decisions.
Berkshire's profits improved across each of its major business units. Their results painted a picture of a U.S. economy that continues to grow but faces increased pressure from rising costs, in part due to the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs. In its building products and McLane's grocery and foodservice businesses, for instance, Berkshire reported higher fuel and raw materials costs, hurting profits. 
Yet at Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC, Berkshire's rail business, they were able to increase prices as more businesses ship by rail due to tight supply in the trucking market.
Berkshire warned that insurance losses due to Hurricane Michael are currently estimated in the $350 million to $550 million range for the fourth quarter. 
UNDER-PRICED?
Berkshire's Class A shares closed Friday at $308,411.01 per share, delivering a total return of 3.6 percent for the year, a bit ahead of the S&P 500's 3.4 percent return. And the company's book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and a preferred measure of growth for Buffett, was $228,712 on Sept. 30, higher than $217,677 one quarter ago.
Among his favorite investments, Buffett has gobbled up shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Berkshire's stake in Apple was worth $57.6 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, up from $47.2 billion at the end of June.
Shares in Apple fell nearly 7 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures.
Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc, a Berkshire shareholder, said Berkshire's buybacks were a good sign.
""It makes sense to me because the stock traded at higher valuations for most of the quarter than where the stock was bought at,"" said Check.

""It reconfirms what we've known for a long time, which is that the stock has been under-priced.""

544,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>",Consumer companies try price hikes as U.S. wages climb,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Consumer goods companies, emboldened by a strong U.S. economy, are rolling out price increases on everyday products and groceries after several years of haggling with big retailers that needed cheaper products to attract customers. 
Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and other grocers have kept prices low over the past two years to fend off growing challenges from Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM), German discount supermarket Aldi Inc, and others.
Companies including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), Kellogg Co (N:K) and  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) have told grocers in recent months that they need to raise prices on some products, as commodities costs surge and truck fleets hike rates. Tariffs resulting from international trade disputes have also pushed the cost of some raw materials higher. 
But now, retailers are more open to price hikes because they believe consumers are willing to pay more for certain goods, said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors. 
""They are finally able to take the price now because the economy is hot. Consumers have money and wages are finally up,"" said Storch, the former CEO of Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) and ex-vice chairman of Target.
U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in nearly a decade, rising 3.1 percent, according to data from the Labor Department on Friday.
Raising prices can be risky, but shoppers with more money in their pockets and more confidence in the economy may be willing to pay more for some snacks, candy, diapers and toothpaste, data from analysts at Bernstein shows.
In October, the mix of household and personal products sold by U.S. retailers rose 1.8 percent, according to a Bernstein analysis of Nielsen data. Sales volumes were flat during the month, a sign consumers were willing to pay more.

Many companies, including P&G, Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) and Kellogg, have invested in product improvements and in making them more attractive to consumers with increased disposable income to justify higher prices.
HONEST DEBATE
Hershey, which makes Ice Breakers mints and KitKat candy bars, raised prices this summer for some multi-pack products, including chewing gum, after negotiations with Walmart about surging costs. Hershey said it had not raised prices in nearly four years.
""Our teams sit down together and look through what it (higher cost) means and we push back hard. We have good honest debate and discussion about how to manage costs together,"" Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies told Reuters last week in a joint phone interview with Hershey CEO Michele Buck. 
P&G, the largest consumer products company, plans to raise prices on Dawn dish detergent, Crest toothpaste, and Old Spice deodorant next year by around 5 to 10 percent. 
Kellogg told retailers last month it will hike prices on products, including Eggo waffles in the United States, and cereal in Asia and Latin America. 
""It's been a tough environment the last seven or eight years, but we see a more inflationary environment going forward,"" Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane said in an phone interview.
Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, said price hikes may also be attributed to increased shareholder activism at consumer companies. 
P&G's board, for example, includes activist investor Nelson Peltz.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>",India iPhone sales to fall for first time in four years: researcher,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone sales are set to dip by around a quarter in India's holiday season fourth quarter, putting them on course for the first full-year fall in four years, industry research firm Counterpoint said on Saturday. 
The Cupertino, California company's struggle to break through with India's 1.3 billion consumers swung more sharply into focus this week after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) blamed a disappointing set of sales forecasts on a handful of big emerging markets. 
Chief Executive Tim Cook said after publishing third quarter results that sales were flat in India in the fourth quarter, which includes a month-long festive season culminating this week in Diwali - a bumper period for electronics sales. 
Neil Shah, research director at HongKong-based Counterpoint Research, said on Saturday its channel checks pointed to numbers for the quarter in the range of 700,000 to 800,000 units, down from about a million a year ago.
For the whole of 2018, Apple was set to sell about  2 million phones - a drop of about a million from last year, he said, as Indians balk at high prices for the devices, driven by trade tariffs and a weak rupee.
""Sales are set to drop for the first time in four years,"" Shah said. ""If you look at Q3 - it was 900k last year and this (year) is almost 450k. 
""Iphones have gone costlier and the features and specs aren’t that compelling. The install base of android has grown vastly; the new customer base (for Apple) is not coming."" 
Cook on Thursday called the company's problems in India ""speed bumps along a very long journey"" and most analysts say that the prestige of Apple's brand should allow it to claim back lost ground as Indians' spending power continues to grow. 

Shah said that, while more than half the phones sold this year were older iPhone models, high selling prices meant Apple's Indian revenue should still be flat or slightly higher than a year ago.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>","Trade war, spy claims cloud horizon for China airshow","By Brenda Goh and Stella Qiu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Trade frictions with the United States and accusations of industrial espionage are set to cast a cloud over China's largest aerospace meeting this week, as suppliers consider what the country's slowing economy could mean for booming jet demand.
The biennial Airshow China, to be held in the coastal city of Zhuhai during Nov 6-11, is traditionally an event for Beijing to parade its growing aviation prowess in front of aerospace executives, diplomats and arms buyers from over 40 countries. 
But analysts say they are not expecting many headline announcements or big deals this year as a bruising trade war between Beijing and Washington and a slowing Chinese economy cause companies to be cautious.
While the tarmac will be filled with planes from the likes of Airbus SA (PA:AIR) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3), the main symbol of China's own commercial aviation ambitions, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China's (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] C919 narrowbody jet, will not be there. A senior executive said it was undergoing test flights.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA), which is opening a 737 completion plant in China, will not display any of its planes but only models at its exhibition stand.
""We're not expecting a big turnout this year,"" said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin. ""As you know the Chinese economy is not doing great this year, so companies that would normally send 10 people will only send five instead."" 
China has become a key hunting ground for foreign firms to do deals as its airlines have expanded fleets to keep up with surging travel demand, putting the country in a position to overtake the United States as the world's top aviation market in the next decade. 
But China's economic growth has weakened to its slowest pace since the financial crisis and its relations with other countries have been tested by Beijing's ambitions to grow its own domestic champions in industries such as aviation. 
And while U.S.-made aircraft have so far escaped Beijing's tariffs, analysts said they were still waiting to see what the trade war would spell for U.S. companies such as Boeing, Honeywell (N:HON) and Gulfstream, who face fierce competition in China from the likes of Airbus and other suppliers. 
The United States exported $16.3 billion of civilian aircraft to China in 2017, the biggest category of goods it exported to China, according to a paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
""It is not unlikely that China might strategically steer future aircraft purchases to Airbus rather than Boeing,"" said Marc Szepan, a China aviation expert at the University of Oxford and former industry executive.""
""In addition, there might be a re-evaluation of the relative attractiveness of industrial partners for China's future aircraft programs such as the CR929 which might favor European over U.S. component and structures suppliers.""
SHOW OF STRENGTH
So far, Beijing has avoided showing its hand in either direction as deals by Chinese leasing firms to buy foreign aircraft are either pushed back or kept private.
Recent U.S. allegations in court filings that Chinese intelligence attempted to steal information on a French-U.S. turbofan engine developed for commercial jetliners - a clear reference to the Safran-General Electric LEAP (PA:SAF) (N:GE) - could further fray relations, analysts said.
Beijing has also criticized the U.S. decision not to send senior officials to a Shanghai import expo that takes place in the same week as the airshow and counts as one of China's most important foreign policy events for the year.
""Right now the political winds are quite concerning,"" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will likely make a deal with China on trade, adding that a lot of progress had been made to resolve the two countries' differences but warning that he still may impose more tariffs on Chinese goods.
China is expected to put on a show of strength in space and defense, with self-developed fighter training FTC-2000 aircraft, a historically high number of weapons as well as its latest unmanned aerial vehicles among the kit on display.
China's air force said on Friday that a number of Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters would perform demo flights, after having debuted at the show two years ago with a 60-second flypast.
Kelvin Wong, senior Asia Pacific defense technology expert at IHS Markit, said this would be part of the deliberate messaging often associated with the closely watched show.

""It appears the PLA (People's Liberation Army) is definitely showcasing its growing confidence in the latest J-20 combat aircraft,"" said Wong.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) deleted more than 10,000 automated accounts posting messages that discouraged people from voting in Tuesday's U.S. election and wrongly appeared to be from Democrats, after the party flagged the misleading tweets to the social media company. 
""We took action on relevant accounts and activity on Twitter,"" a Twitter spokesman said in an email. The removals took place in late September and early October.
Twitter removed more than 10,000 accounts, according to three sources familiar with the Democrats' effort. The number is modest, considering that Twitter has previously deleted millions of accounts it determined were responsible for spreading misinformation in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
Yet the removals represent an early win for a fledgling effort by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, a party group that supports Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives.
The DCCC launched the effort this year in response to the party's inability to respond to millions of accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms that spread negative and false information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other party candidates in 2016, three people familiar with the operation told Reuters. 
While the prevalence of misinformation campaigns have so far been modest in the run-up to the Congressional elections on Nov. 6, Democrats are hoping the flagging operation will help them react quickly if there is a flurry of such messages in the coming days.
The Tweets included ones that discouraged Democratic men from voting, saying that would drown out the voice of women, according to two of the sources familiar with the flagging operation. 
The DCCC developed its own system for identifying and reporting malicious automated accounts on social media, according to the three party sources. 
The system was built in part from publicly available tools known as ""Hoaxley"" and ""Botometer"" developed by University of Indiana computer researchers. They allow a user to identify automated accounts, also known as bots, and analyze how they spread information on specific topics. 
""We made Hoaxley and Botometer free for anyone to use because people deserve to know what’s a bot and what’s not,"" said Filippo Menczer, professor of informatics and computer science at the University of Indiana. 
The Democratic National Committee works with a group of contractors and partners to rapidly identify misinformation campaigns. 
They include RoBhat Labs, a firm whose website says it has developed technology capable of detecting bots and identifying political-bias in messages.
The collaboration with RoBhat has already led to the discovery of malicious accounts and posts, which were referred to social media companies and other campaign officials, DNC Chief Technology Officer Raffi Krikorian said in email. 
Krikorian did not say whether the flagged posts were ultimately removed by Twitter. 
""We provide the DNC with reports about what we’re seeing in terms of bot activity and where it’s being amplified,"" said Ash Bhat, co-founder of RoBhat Labs. 

""We can’t tell you who’s behind these different operations, Twitter hides that from us, but with the technology you known when and how it’s happening,"" Bhat said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has asked Pennsylvania for permission to resume self-driving car testing on public roads and has improved the autonomous vehicle software, the company said on Friday, more than seven months after it suspended testing following a deadly crash in Arizona.
The company disclosed in a report to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it would resume testing with two employees in the front seat, enable an automatic braking system at all times, and more strictly monitor safety employees.
Uber has been testing self-driving cars in manual mode on public streets.
In June, police in Tempe, Arizona, said a back-up driver behind the wheel of a self-driving Uber was distracted and streaming a television show on her phone right up until about the time the car struck and killed a pedestrian walking across a street, deeming the crash that rocked the nascent industry ""entirely avoidable.""
The crash was the first death attributed to a self-driving vehicle and was seen as a significant setback for the industry, which is racing to get vehicles into commercial use.
Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement Friday the company would resume road tests only after implementing ""improved processes.""
Uber said it now has real-time third party monitoring of back-up safety drivers, sets limits on the time drivers can work per day and has improved training.
In July, Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation said it was issuing new guidelines asking companies to submit details about testing, and that it expected companies would comply.
A spokeswoman for the agency said Friday it had received the application and would review it.
The state said it would send companies an authorization letter after approving their submissions. Uber said it would not resume testing in Pittsburgh until it received that letter.
Alphabet Inc's Waymo (O:GOOGL) unit plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service in Arizona this year, while General Motors Co (N:GM) is on track to roll out a similar service next year with vehicles without steering wheels or brake pedals.
Authorities in Pittsburgh, where Uber debuted its self-driving vehicles in 2016, have said they welcome the cars back on city streets.
""I think we have increased confidence,"" said Karina Ricks, director of the city's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, citing the addition of a second employee in cars being tested and more transparency from Uber.
Following the Tempe accident, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto balked at allowing Uber to resume autonomous driving before a full federal investigation of the crash. 
""One of the problems with Uber was they appeared to be moving just a bit too fast,"" Ricks said. ""They got a little cocky about their technology.""
The crash raised significant questions about the performance of Uber's software.
Uber said a key recommendation of an internal review after the Tempe crash was to improve the self-driving vehicles' ""overall software system design."" Uber said in its safety report released Friday the vehicle had improved ""system latency,"" allowing it to detect objects and actors sooner and execute safe reactions faster.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which has an ongoing investigation, said in May that Uber registered observations of the pedestrian about six seconds before impact, but the system did not determine that emergency braking was needed until 1.3 seconds before impact.
The NTSB said the vehicle had registered the pedestrian who was walking a bike across the road first as an unknown object, then a vehicle and lastly a bicycle.
GRAPHIC-How self-driving cars see the road - http://tmsnrt.rs/2FToUeq
Uber said it had a new approach to ""handling uncertainty within the self-driving system."" Uber also has a new separate systems engineering testing team and plans a self-driving safety advisory board of outside experts. If a vehicle is uncertain about something in its view the software is now better positioned to ""reason over many possible outcomes to ultimately come to a safe response,"" it added.
The NTSB also said Uber had disabled an manufacturer-installed automatic emergency braking system in the 2017 Volvo XC90 while the car was under computer control in order to ""reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.""

That braking system is now active whenever Uber is testing on public roads, it said on Friday. It has also filed a voluntary safety assessment with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on its self-driving efforts and made public a report from an outside law firm that reviewed the safety culture at Uber. The agency has an ongoing probe of the Tempe crash.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.43%. The S&P 500 fell 0.63%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.04%.
""President Xi (Jinping) and I have agreed to meet at the G20 summit,"" Trump told reporters Friday. Trump added that ""a lot of progress"" had been made toward reaching a deal that would be ""very fair for everybody.""
Trade-sensitive names such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) ended mixed as investors digested differing comments on trade.
Trump's comments seemingly contradicted earlier remarks from White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who indicated little progress had been made with China, denying reports that the president had asked his Cabinet to put together a trade deal with the country.
Bloomberg reported earlier Friday that Trump had asked officials to prepare a draft for a U.S.-China trade deal.
Beyond trade, tech stocks wreaked havoc on the broader market, led by a slump in shares of Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 7% after its above-forecast earnings and revenue was overshadowed by soft guidance and weaker-than-expected iPhone shipments in the last quarter.
The S&P 500 technology sector fell about 2%.
Adding to fears that U.S. corporates are nearing peak profit growth, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) posted earnings that fell short of expectations, as margins were squeezed by rising costs and lower prices. Its shares fell 9%.
Energy, meanwhile, shrugged off a fall in oil prices on the back of oversupply worries after the United States said it would give waivers to eight Iranian crude customers. U.S. oil prices fell 6.6% this week.
In economic news, the United States created more jobs than expected last month, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates, sending government bond yields surging.
The Labor Department said Friday nonfarm payroll employment increased by 250,000 jobs in October, beating economists' estimates for 193,000 new jobs. While the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%.
The benchmark United States 10-Year yield traded around 3.22% while the United States 2-Year climbed to 2.92%, its highest level in a decade.
In corporate news, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was up slightly in after-hours trade after the social media company deleted more than 10,000 automated twitter accounts discouraging people from voting in the midterm elections, according to a report Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were on track to snap a three-day rally on Friday after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow weakened optimism over U.S.-China trade talks and as Apple shares dropped following a disappointing forecast.
While President Donald Trump would meet China President Xi Jinping this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up a proposed trade plan, Kudlow told CNBC, contradicting a report earlier in the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution.
Stocks extended losses following the news, with the trade-sensitive industrial sector (SPLRCI), which was up as much as 1.13 percent earlier, falling to a session low. It was last down 0.1 percent.

Apple Inc (O:AAPL) tumbled 7.2 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter may miss expectations.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Friday scored among the ten worst banks in the latest round of European stress tests, yet another sign of weakness at Germany's largest lender.
Under the test's toughest ""adverse"" scenario, Germany's flagship lender's core capital ratio was 8.1 percent for 2020, placing it in 40th place out of 48 lenders measured.
In the 2016 test, the capital level of Deutsche Bank dropped to 7.8 percent, ranking it tenth from the bottom from a health check for 51 lenders.
Some analysts had expected Germany's biggest lender to fare badly after three years of losses.
There was no formal pass/fail mark, but investors are checking how much core capital lenders hold against a threshold of 5.5 percent. The closely watched health check across the European Union conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) could force laggards to raise capital or ditch assets.
""We will not change how we manage the bank after the stress tests"", Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said, adding that the bank's internal stress test methodologies differed from those used by the EBA test.
""We do not expect any impact on our SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process) levels from the test,"" he said, referring to the bank's minimum capital levels as defined by the regulators.
The test result mainly reflected the decrease in Deutsche's earnings but did not show the bank's lowered risk profile, because it failed to account for disposed assets and due to the way the test treats strategic liquidity reserves, von Moltke said. 
""Due to the design of the test the results do not fully reflect what management has done since the 2016 tests,"" von Moltke said, adding that if backward-looking elements were taken out, Deutsche's results would have been much more favorable. 
A person close to the matter said that adjusted for these factors Deutsche's result would have been around 12 percent.
Despite improvements to Deutsche Bank's capital ratio, analysts had expected 2018 results to be roughly on par with the lender's score in 2016, analysts said, after the EBA included a harsher adverse scenario.
""The result reflects that certain measures to strengthen the capital buffers have been taken. I do not see immediate need for action – such as the sale of assets,"" said Michael Huenseler, credit manager at Assenagon Asset Management. ""The Deutsche Bank result is not shocking and some other banks have clearly fared worse.""
British lenders  Barclays  (L:BARC) and Lloyds (L:LLOY), and Italy's Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) fared worst in the European Union-wide stress test of banking resilience to simulated market shocks.
After three years of losses at Deutsche Bank, a failed stress test in the U.S., several attempts to restructure, a leadership shake-up and a ratings downgrade, many investors have lost faith in Germany's biggest bank, whose shares have fallen by 40 percent this year.
In June, Deutsche's U.S. subsidiary was the only bank to fail a different set of Federal Reserve stress tests due to ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in the bank's capital planning controls. 
It was an embarrassment for Deutsche, which regulators deem one of the most important banks in the global financial system. 
Last week, Deutsche warned that revenue was expected to drop in 2018 from a year before, though it expected to post a profit for the first time since 2014. 
At the time, CEO Christian Sewing pointed to the strength of the bank's CET 1 ratio at 14 percent and that he was ""managing our risk levels conservatively"".
The credit ratings agency Moody's, which grades Deutsche with a negative outlook in part because of its modest earnings potential, last week called Deutsche's capitalization, asset quality and liquidity ""sound"".

Last month Tesla disclosed $52 million in ""zero emission vehicle"" credit sales, but the quarterly filing includes all regulatory credits, including the ZEV credits.
Higher gross margins that exceeded Tesla's guidance in the quarter were helped by lower costs and an ""increase in regulatory credits, which have no associated costs,"" Tesla wrote.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Earnings for the two largest U.S. oil companies on Friday jumped on higher crude prices and the nation's shale boom, joining big oil rivals in posting sharply higher quarterly profit. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) posted a 57-percent increase on prices there were up 44 percent over a year ago helped by a lower tax rate while  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) earnings doubled on surging output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. 
While Exxon's results topped Wall Street forecasts, but shares were up fractionally as its oil and gas production declined for the ninth of the last 10 quarters. 
Chevron's shares rose 2.7 percent as it forecast continued strong oil production this quarter.
Results for most of the world's top oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years, driven by strong demand for oil and years of cost-cutting. Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and  BP  Plc (L:BP) this week reported profit of $3.8 billion.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon is investing heavily to reverse its production declines. It spent $6.59 billion on capital projects during the quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year. 
Executives on Friday said the company plans to continue to prioritize spending on new projects and shareholder dividends over stock repurchases, something that investors have been calling for it to restart. Exxon halted buybacks except to offset dilution in 2016.
""The company that a decade ago had the largest buyback program in the S&P 500 is now altogether absent from the buyback table,"" said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov in a note on Friday. 
Chevron said it benefited from running 20 drilling rigs in the Permian basin during the quarter and new well designs that have boosted output. It produced 338,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter from the field and forecast sustained Permian growth this quarter. 
""The economic outcomes are really outstanding,"" Pat Yarrington, Chevron finance chief, told analysts on Friday. 
She said that the San Ramon California-based company plans to hold to its full-year capital spending budget of between $18 billion and $20 billion, despite spending about $450 million more than it anticipated year-to-date. 

Exxon reported earnings of $6.24 billion, or $1.46 per share, while analysts had forecast a per share profit of $1.23. Chevron reported earnings of $4.05 billion, or $2.11 per share, compared with analysts' estimate for $2.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 01:22PM ET</span>",Special Report: How top soccer clubs clashed with rules on financial fair play,"By Cassell Bryan-Low and Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - One of the most powerful men in soccer, Gianni Infantino, has long championed fairness in the world's most popular sport. In public, the sports administrator has promoted rules intended to reduce debts and prevent top clubs with super-rich owners from using their wealth to dominate the game.
In private, he has sometimes taken a gentler line.
An examination of thousands of documents relating to the affairs of leading clubs shows that Infantino was involved in negotiations that led to two of the richest agreeing favorable settlements when they ran into problems over rules governing finances. Those settlements with the Club Financial Control Body of Europe's governing authority for soccer, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), enabled Manchester City of Britain and Paris St. Germain of France to avoid the toughest sanctions, including potentially being banned from competitions.
Infantino, 48, is currently president of the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, the global governing body for soccer. Until 2016, he was general secretary of UEFA. Since 2014, UEFA's regulators have accepted that Paris St. Germain and Man City could value sponsorship deals at levels far above those recommended by independent experts hired by UEFA's investigators. In the case of Paris St. Germain this involved hundreds of millions of euros, and for Man City tens of millions of euros, the documents show.
The ""Football Leaks"" documents (see related story), which include emails, contracts and presentations relating to the clubs, were obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters in partnership with European Investigative Collaborations, a consortium of international media. The cache, which spans much of the past 10 years, includes previously undisclosed details of UEFA's investigation of the two clubs' financial affairs, the settlement terms and Infantino's involvement in the negotiations.
Man City is part of City Football Group, which is majority owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, half-brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The sheikh is a deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and has a soccer empire that also includes clubs in the United States, Australia and Uruguay.
Paris St. Germain is owned by Qatar Sports Investments, a state-backed body founded by the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. His country is currently spending billions of dollars in preparation for hosting the next FIFA World Cup in 2022.
Under UEFA's ""Financial Fair Play"" rules, clubs must be transparent about revenues and broadly balance them against expenditure. The rules are designed to encourage clubs to live within their means and prevent the sport's richest owners from crushing their rivals, killing the vibrant competition that pulls in fans. The regulations include a limit on the losses clubs can incur. They are intended, among other things, to prevent clubs running up big debts or receiving unlimited amounts of money through inflated sponsorship deals with organizations related to the owners. In short, related-party sponsors should not pay more than the market rate to support a club.
In the cases of Man City and Paris St. Germain, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB), which oversees Financial Fair Play rules, accepted that the clubs could receive income from Emirati and Qatari sponsors that was far in excess of the market value estimated by independent experts hired by UEFA to assess the deals, according to investigatory reports, settlement agreements and other documents. UEFA's investigators concluded that key sponsors were related to the club owners, the documents show.
With Paris St. Germain, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body allowed the club to value its sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, a government agency, at 100 million euros a year. Yet independent experts advising the CFCB told it the market value of the QTA sponsorship was only a few million euros a year or less, the documents show.
With Man City, UEFA's control body allowed the club to book three times more income from some Abu Dhabi sponsors than independent experts deemed the sponsorship deals were worth – about an extra 20 million pounds a year.
These arrangements helped to boost the clubs' income, enabling them to comply with UEFA rules that limit the losses clubs are allowed to incur. That, in turn, helped the clubs to spend tens of millions more on players than they otherwise would have been able to do.
Paris St. Germain said its compliance with the Financial Fair Play rules had been ""exemplary."" The club's deputy chief executive, Jean-Claude Blanc, also said the financial regulations were misused and have ""become an instrument to prevent new entrants"" from winning Europe's top soccer tournament and ""to prevent shareholders from investing freely in their business.""
In a statement Man City said: ""We will not be providing any comment on out of context materials purported to have been hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people. The attempt to damage the Club's reputation is organized and clear.""
Neither Qatar's emir nor Sheikh Mansour responded to requests for comment.
UEFA said in a statement that the organization and its Financial Fair Play rules were there to ""assist clubs to become financially sustainable and to live within their means and only to sanction them as a last resort."" Among the most important objectives, it said, was to ensure that ""European club football is viable (as a whole).""
UEFA added that the Financial Fair Play rules are relatively new and that in the early cases the decisions and sanctions took both UEFA and the clubs into uncharted territory. It added: ""UEFA is confident that any apparent inconsistencies that may seem evident to some, have been eliminated as the system has developed and become more familiar to all sides.""
FIFA, in response to questions addressed to Infantino, said the central purpose of the Financial Fair Play rules has been to ""improve standards of financial management in European football, to reduce indebtedness, and to help clubs operate on the basis of their own resources, so they can be run as stable and sustainable businesses."" It said the rules have ""been an economic success story for European football.""
According to the documents, Man City and Paris St. Germain rejected the assertions by UEFA's control body that the sponsors from their owners' home countries were related parties. The clubs also disputed that the sponsorship valuations were inflated. In an April 2014 response to UEFA's investigators, Man City said an assessment by an external expert acting for UEFA's control body that found the club was related to key sponsors contained ""erroneous conclusions and assertions.""
The issues arose during UEFA's routine monitoring of club finances. Settlements that UEFA's control body agreed in 2014 with the two clubs state that neither club considered itself to be in breach of UEFA's rules, and that both clubs agreed to settle disputes over their finances to avoid potential legal costs.
UEFA said in its statement: ""In cases where clubs overspend and balance their books only thanks to money injections, a settlement agreement has always been the preferred solution. In such cases, the focus is on limiting the revenues coming from outside football.""
Infantino, who is a striking figure, tall, slim and bald, frequently interacted with the clubs in negotiations over their compliance with financial rules. In an April 2014 email to colleagues, Ferran Soriano, CEO of Man City, said he and Infantino had agreed to instruct Man City and UEFA lawyers ""to negotiate a settlement that is more than a warning and can be seen as effective/dissuasive but does not affect dramatically MCFC (Manchester City Football Club) business.""
Soriano did not respond to requests for comment. FIFA, in responding to questions addressed to Infantino, did not comment on the exchange involving Soriano.
The documents provide remarkable insight into the business activities of powerful individuals and state-backed enterprises in the Gulf, where media scrutiny is limited, even as their investments are growing increasingly influential in Britain, Europe and beyond. The documents also provide evidence that could supercharge one of the biggest controversies in world soccer.
Rivals have alleged the two clubs have benefited unfairly from overvalued sponsor contracts and have urged UEFA to clamp down. The financial firepower of Man City and Paris St. Germain has helped to propel them to the top of the leagues in England and France, and to qualify for Europe's top tournament, the UEFA Champions League.
The head of the Spanish football league, Javier Tebas, last year alleged that Man City and Paris St. Germain had received ""state aid"" that ""distorts European competitions and creates an inflationary spiral that is irreparably harming the football industry."" Last month, Tebas reiterated to Reuters that sponsorship deals from state-backed entities that were above market values were detrimental to others. ""It's about the effect it has in distorting the market of footballers on a European level,"" he said.
Man City and Paris St. Germain rejected such accusations when they arose last year, saying the clubs complied with the Financial Fair Play rules.
A person familiar with UEFA's process confirmed that independent experts had told UEFA's control body in 2014 that the market value of key sponsorships had been far below the value the clubs ascribed to them. Allowing some clubs to bend the rules, this person said, ultimately means that ordinary supporters, who pay what can be high prices for tickets, ""get hurt.""
QATAR'S LARGESSE
The global reach of soccer has turned the sport into a financial behemoth, with funds flooding in from TV rights as well as gate receipts and other sources. Revenues at European clubs have tripled since 2000, according to a UEFA report published in January, and reached 18.5 billion euros in 2016. That dwarfs America's largest professional sport, the National Football League, which some analysts estimate has annual revenue of about $14 billion (11 billion euros). The European game's popularity is increasing in the United States, which is due to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
But clubs also face huge outlays, particularly in acquiring star players, who can cost tens of millions of euros in transfer fees – the sum paid by one club to another to release a player from a contract so that they can change clubs. On top of their purchase cost, star players can command wages running to hundreds of thousands of euros a week.
With many clubs racking up hefty losses, UEFA introduced its Financial Fair Play rules in 2010 and began evaluating clubs in 2013. The rules broadly require club spending not to exceed revenue from television rights, gate receipts, competition prize money and sponsorship. Since 2015, clubs have been allowed to lose no more than 30 million euros over three seasons, on the grounds that they should not simply be funded by big debts or super-rich owners. Before that, when UEFA was phasing in the rules, clubs were allowed to lose up to 45 million euros over two years.
The aim is to sustain viable competition between a wide range of European clubs over the long term.
Infantino, who was born in Switzerland, speaks seven languages, including Arabic, and qualified as a lawyer. He became a key promoter of the new policy as it was being introduced. In early 2014, he told news media the rules were designed to save European soccer from ""greed, reckless spending and financial insanity,"" according to UEFA's website. He also warned clubs that his organization was ""not afraid to take the necessary measures to protect the game and to maintain the integrity of its competitions.""
The rules required clubs wishing to participate in UEFA competitions to submit information about their finances for monitoring. In 2013, UEFA's investigatory arm, part of its Club Financial Control Body, began to question elements of accounts submitted by Man City and Paris St. Germain.
With Paris St. Germain, the key issue was its relationship with the Qatar Tourism Authority, a state agency. According to the sponsorship contract between the authority and the club, the authority agreed to pay Paris St. Germain between 700 million euros and 1.125 billion euros over five years, depending on tournament performance.
Under Financial Fair Play rules, what mattered was whether the QTA was a ""related party"" to the club owner. If it was, then UEFA's rules meant that the club could recognize only a market value for the contract in its assessment under the Financial Fair Play rules.
UEFA's investigators concluded that the government tourism authority was a related party because the company that owned Paris St. Germain, Qatar Sports Investments, was majority owned by another arm of the Qatari state – the Ministry of Finance.
The investigators drew up a draft of a preliminary view report, dated April 16, 2014, prepared for the investigatory arm of the Club Financial Control Body. It said the QTA sponsorship deal appeared to be ""massively inflated."" Reuters was unable to determine whether a final version was produced. The draft report said the sponsorship rights received were worth ""a tiny fraction"" of the 200 million euros the QTA spent on Paris St. Germain in the year to mid-2013.
The draft report cited external experts who valued the sponsorship deal at that time as worth 3 million euros or less per year. One of the expert advisers was Octagon, a sports marketing and sponsorship consultancy that is headquartered in the United States and has offices worldwide. In its report for UEFA investigators, Octagon noted that the QTA contract did not entitle the tourism authority to display its brand on the players' shirts – a right for which companies usually pay the most money. Yet the QTA arrangement was ""by far the most lucrative commercial agreement in European Football,"" according to Octagon's report.
Asked for comment, Octagon referred inquiries to UEFA. UEFA did not comment on Octagon's report.
UEFA investigators' view was that Paris St. Germain should not include all the QTA sponsor money when it was assessed under Financial Fair Play rules. But without that money, the club, referred to in the documents by the initials PSG, would make losses that risked it being banned from competition.
""The evidence demonstrates that the QTA-PSG Agreement aims to circumvent the objectives"" of the Financial Fair Play rules, the draft report by UEFA investigators concluded. It added that while it ""may have some characteristics of a sponsorship contract ... the main objective of the QTA-PSG Agreement is, nevertheless, the supplementation of PSG's financial means by QTA so that the Club can acquire players.""
According to the draft report, the sponsorship agreement appeared not to have been preceded ""by any meaningful commercial negotiation (or, indeed, any negotiation at all).""
The club's deputy chief executive, Blanc, said in response to questions last month that the valuation methodology of UEFA and Octagon did not apply because the contract with the QTA was a ""nation branding"" agreement to promote a country, rather than a traditional sponsorship deal.
The UEFA investigators' draft report recommended that, if the investigators could not reach a settlement with the club, UEFA's ""Adjudicatory Chamber"" should find Paris St. Germain in breach of the rules and impose disciplinary measures, ""including the possibility of exclusion from future UEFA competitions."" Such a move would be akin in the United States to excluding one of the largest American football teams from the post-season playoffs and the Super Bowl.
By early 2014, Infantino had become involved, acting as an intermediary between the club and UEFA's Club Financial Control Body.
Asked in September whether he might have taken a tougher line on clubs such as Paris St. Germain over Financial Fair Play, Infantino said he helped to introduce the rules but did not implement them. ""I am happy that we introduced it,"" he told Reuters. ""I wasn't 'tough' or 'not tough'. We had bodies who were taking decisions ... I was involved in the concept, the rules and so on.""
FIFA said in its statement that the UEFA administration - which at the time included Infantino as general secretary - can assist the Club Financial Control Body. ""This may include discussions, meetings, assistance to help find solutions, and other interactions to assist the CFCB in its work,"" FIFA said. It added: ""Nonetheless, the CFCB is entirely responsible for their own decisions.""
UEFA also said its Club Financial Control Body was responsible for overseeing Financial Fair Play rules and was ""an independent entity."" It said the UEFA administration provides the CFCB with staff, infrastructure and administrative support, and ""acts as a go-between among the various parties,"" but that settlement agreements are the outcome of negotiations between the CFCB's investigators and the clubs concerned. The Club Financial Control Body said it could not comment on its deliberations for reasons of confidentiality.
In the final 2014 confidential settlement, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body agreed that Paris St. Germain could include 100 million euros a year from the QTA deal in its Financial Fair Play assessment, if the contract terms were amended. Though that was less than the QTA contract had envisaged, it was still far more than the market value put on the contract by UEFA's independent experts.
Those terms were not publicly disclosed by UEFA or the club. Instead, UEFA announced that the club had agreed to limit its spending on buying players and committed to reduce its losses in order to meet UEFA's rules by the financial year ending in 2016. UEFA's control body also imposed a fine on the club, but said most of it would be returned if the club met certain measures, including limits on making losses and buying players. In 2017, UEFA said that Paris St. Germain had complied with the requirements and met the objectives of the settlement agreement.
In the 2014 announcement, UEFA said that it had assigned the QTA contract a fair value ""significantly below that submitted by the club."" But the announcement did not disclose a figure for that value. And it did not mention the extent to which independent experts had assessed the contract to be overvalued.
Support for the agreement wasn't universal inside UEFA. In the weeks before the agreement was signed, acting chief investigator Brian Quinn, a former senior official at the Bank of England and former soccer club chairman, stepped down from his role. According to the person familiar with the process, Quinn told colleagues he wasn't able to approve the Paris St. Germain settlement because he considered it ""too lenient"" given the size of the breach. Instead, the settlement was approved by a new acting chief investigator; Quinn remained a member of the investigatory chamber until mid-2015.
ABU DHABI FUNDS
For many years, Manchester City played in the shadow of its more successful local rival, Manchester United, and struggled to stay in Britain's top soccer league. Then, in 2008, Sheikh Mansour of the United Arab Emirates took control of Man City and began to transform it. With expensive new star players, the club went on to top the Premier League three times over the past decade.
After the Financial Fair Play rules came into effect, UEFA began routine monitoring of clubs' finances. It chose to look more closely at Man City as well as Paris St. Germain.
According to the final preliminary view report by the investigatory chamber of UEFA's Club Financial Control Body, Sheikh Mansour had ""significant influence"" over two of Man City's Abu Dhabi sponsors. The report found that the amount being paid for those sponsorships was three times their market value.
UEFA's investigatory arm determined that Man City had made losses of 233 million euros during the two-year period ended in May 31, 2013, when the club made adjustments the investigators required, including judging key sponsorship contracts at market values determined by the experts, according to the chief investigator's report. That was 188 million of losses more than was allowable under UEFA's rules, the report said.
As with Paris St. Germain, the report recommended that the Adjudicatory Chamber, a part of UEFA's control body, should find Man City in breach of the rules and impose disciplinary measures, including a possible ban from competitions, unless the club reached a settlement with the investigators.
Man City told UEFA investigators it rejected the claims that Abu Dhabi sponsors were related parties or that those sponsors were paying over the odds. The club said in an April 2014 response to UEFA investigators that it had complied with the rules and ""adopted a good faith and correct interpretation of the regulations.""
Infantino was involved in brokering a settlement. He arranged to meet the club's CEO, Ferran Soriano, on May 8, 2014, for what Soriano described in an email as ""a 'secret' meeting in London to try to agree the final deal."" Soriano did not respond to requests for comment.
It's not clear exactly what ensued. But subsequently, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body rejected a proposed deal for being too generous to Man City.
""Unfortunately I've been informed that the investigatory chamber has come to the conclusion that the positions are still too distant for them to agree on a settlement agreement. I regret this a lot,"" Infantino wrote to Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak on May 12, 2014.
Nevertheless, four days later a deal was agreed. Man City did not get all it wanted. However, according to the final settlement agreement, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body accepted that for 2014 and the following two years Man City could have sponsorship contracts with two Emirati sponsors at values totaling 26 million euros per year more than the ""fair value"" determined by the experts advising UEFA.
LATEST PROBE
UEFA's generous position towards Paris St. Germain has continued in recent years. In 2015, UEFA re-affirmed to the club that it could record 100 million euros a year in revenue from the Qatar Tourism Authority, according to the documents. The contract between the club and the tourist agency had expanded from fewer than 10 pages to more than 60, but Paris St. Germain still did not grant the QTA the right to have its name on players' shirts. That kind of branding usually drives sponsorship of over 10 million euros a year, according to the views given to UEFA's control body by independent experts.
Other clubs have not been so fortunate. Since 2015, UEFA's control body has temporarily banned three smaller clubs for breaching its Financial Fair Play rules by reporting sizeable losses. One was Dynamo Moscow of Russia, which in 2015 was banned from the UEFA Champions League for a season for failing to meet the rules on breaking even.
The club's controlling shareholder at the time was VTB, a Russian bank. UEFA's investigators ruled that a sponsorship deal the club had with VTB was with a related party and therefore had to be assessed at market value, according to a ruling published by UEFA's Club Financial Control Body. That market value was up to 80 million euros a year less than the face value of the sponsorship contract, an expert report said.
The Club Financial Control Body said the deal needed to be booked at market value to meet Financial Fair Play rules. The club complied. That meant the club reported losses far above the level permitted under the Financial Fair Play rules for the three years to 2014.
Dynamo Moscow didn't respond to requests for comment.
Other clubs, including AS Roma and Inter Milan, have said in statements and media interviews that to comply with Financial Fair Play rules they took various measures, including selling players, that put their on-pitch performance at risk. AS Roma and Inter Milan didn't respond to requests for comment.
Meanwhile, Paris St. Germain and Man City went on to acquire top talent at high prices, spending more than 1 billion euros in total on signing players since their settlements with UEFA's control body, according to published UEFA figures. In 2017, Paris St. Germain embarked on a summer spending spree, including the signing of Brazilian striker Neymar for a record-breaking 222 million euros ($256 million).
That prompted some in the sport to complain, including Spain's La Liga, which called on UEFA to investigate the French club again. In late 2017, UEFA announced it was opening a new investigation of Paris St. Germain as part of monitoring Financial Fair Play rules.
Money had continued to pour into Paris St. Germain from Qatari sponsors. Again, the sports consultancy Octagon, acting as an independent expert, concluded the Qatar Tourism Authority deal was valued far above the market rate. In a report in January 2018, Octagon said it ""would suggest a value of €5,500,000 as the fair market value"" for the QTA sponsorship for the year ended in mid-2017.
Octagon added: ""Given the nature of the sponsorship assets, we would not suggest any higher valuation for the 2017/18 season.""
Yet the Qatar Tourism Authority had agreed to pay Paris St. Germain at least 145 million euros a year, according to the revised sponsorship contract.
On June 13, UEFA announced it had ended the probe. It said that following a review by the Club Financial Control Body's investigatory panel the club had made ""significant fair value adjustments"" to several sponsorship contracts, but did not disclose what the adjustments were. As a result, UEFA said, Paris St. Germain's financial results for the financial years ending in 2015, 2016 and 2017 had been within the rules.
Paris St. Germain said UEFA's investigatory chamber required the club to reduce the revenues it booked from the QTA contract to between 50 million and 60 million euros for the years ending in mid-2017 and mid-2018, which forced the club to sell players in order to comply with the rules. The club also said that UEFA's investigators ruled that Paris St. Germain wouldn't be able to renew its QTA contract beyond mid-2019.
Then in early July, UEFA said the chairman of the investigative body asked UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber to review the decision to close the Paris St. Germain probe. And in mid September, UEFA announced that it had referred the case of Paris St. Germain back to its Club Financial Control Body for ""further investigation.""
UEFA did not respond directly to questions about the latest probe. However, in its statement, it said that it was ""very satisfied"" with how the rules have been applied and the results they have achieved. It noted that since the Financial Fair Play rules had been introduced there had been an improvement in the finances of European soccer clubs – which have gone from recording record losses of 1.7 billion euros in fiscal year 2011 to profits of 600 million euros in 2017.
""No system is perfect but on the whole FFP has increasingly protected European football from financial difficulty since its introduction in 2010,"" UEFA said.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>","VW may sideline Audi, link with rivals in new 10-year plan","By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) boss Herbert Diess will outline a 10-year plan on Nov. 16 to slash research costs by working with rivals, a step which would sideline Audi as the group's leading development center.
The chief executive will present his plan at a meeting of the German carmaker's supervisory board, two sources told Reuters. 
It will explore potential alliances with Ford (N:F) and others to develop autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs). If approved by the board, it would signal a major departure from VW's standalone efforts to build them and diminish Audi's importance as an engineering hub. 
Automakers globally are considering teaming up to save money on development, which cost VW $13.1 billion in 2017, in the race to get EVs and self-driving cars on the road.
Savings are particularly important for VW as it tries to get its business back on track after an emissions scandal. It faces a big bill to make its combustion engines comply with new anti-pollution rules.
""The strategy plan doesn't only cover the next five years, but looks a decade ahead,"" one of the sources said.
A VW spokesman declined to comment on the agenda of the company's next supervisory board meeting.
Audi spokesman Peter Oberndorfer said no formal decisions have been taken about reassigning Audi's responsibilities on autonomous driving within the group. 
Diess also aims to cut duplicate efforts on technology development among VW's different brands, and to seek greater economies of scale by partnering with software companies, carmakers and battery cell manufacturers.
The strategy could also deepen existing cooperation with Ford. 
This could include the U.S. carmaker supplying a pickup truck platform and some engines to VW (DE:VOWG_p), one of the sources said. VW could also buy a stake in Ford's autonomous cars program and give Ford access to its MEB electric cars platform, they said.
Ford has said it has an agreement with VW to discuss potential collaborations across a number of areas but it was premature to provide details. 
VW and Ford are under pressure to roll out more EVs in Europe, after the emissions scandal, which originated at Audi. 
Emissions rules in Europe are still being finalised but VW would need to raise its share of fully electric vehicles to 30 percent of new car sales to cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide by 30 percent by 2030.
TIGHTER GRIP
Audi, whose slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik or Advantage Through Technology, has been VW's research and development hub for decades. But its engineers developed the engine management cheating software that masked excessive pollution levels. 
The departure of senior Audi executives after the scandal has left a leadership vacuum just as carmakers are trying to keep up with innovations by software and technology companies. 
Audi's stumble also comes as Diess is tightening his grip on the sprawling multi-brand car and trucks group, which includes Skoda, Seat, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Ducati, Scania and MAN.
To cut the costs of developing an electric car platform for premium vehicles, VW has already bundled development between Porsche and Audi. 
""The pendulum is swinging back in the direction of centralization,"" a senior Volkswagen executive told Reuters 
Audi has been developing autonomous technology for VW, Audi and Porsche. It built the A8, a car with advanced self-driving features, but its efforts for a fully autonomous car have fallen behind rival companies like Alphabet Inc's Waymo (O:GOOGL).
""We want to have access to a self-driving system and we are speaking with relevant players. It is very expensive to develop and others are already well advanced,"" Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said in a phone call with reporters on Tuesday.
Diess fears German carmakers will lose their edge unless they make radical changes. He said last month there was a 50-50 chance they would still be among the global elite in 10 years' time. 

Electric cars are still too expensive to produce for mainstream consumers to afford them and so carmakers must find savings or greater economies of scale to make them cheaper.

Kraft Heinz fell about 9% after it posted mixed quarterly results showing a miss on earnings, but a beat on revenue, as margins were squeezed by rising costs and lower prices.
The earnings miss prompted a wave of bearish calls from analysts, who questioned how quickly the company can turn its fortunes around at a time when others in the food sector are also feeling the heat from rising costs.
Kraft ""has pivoted from a top-line oriented show-me story to a margin oriented show-me story,"" and for now, consensus estimates ""are too high,"" Goldman Sachs said.
 Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) fell 5% on Friday, cooling its four-day winning streak, following the company's above-forecast earnings report early this week.
On the earnings call, Molson Coors CEO Mark R. Hunter piqued investor interest, vowing to ""secure a meaningful share"" of the cannabis-infused beverage market when edibles are legalized in Canada.
 Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) fell more than 3% after accusing activist hedge fund Third Point of copying its turnaround plan.
In a letter to shareholders, Campbell Soup urged shareholders to vote in support of the current board of directors and reject Third Point's board candidates.
By copying Campbell's turnaround plan, Third Point is ""wasting everyone's time,"" and is attempting to seize control of the company with a ""slate of underqualified candidates,"" Campbell's said in a letter to shareholders.
The consumer staples sector fell about 1%, nursing losses of about 4.1% year to date."

Abraham Ortega, a former financial executive at PDVSA, accepted $5 million in bribes to favor a French oil company and a Russian bank, U.S. prosecutors in Florida said on Wednesday in a statement, which did not name either company.
A source with knowledge of the matter on Thursday told Reuters that French oil company Perenco and Gazprombank were the two companies. 
""Gazprombank denies information of any connection between the bank and/or any of the bank's group of companies to alleged $1.2 billion money laundering, as well as alleged corruption cases at PDVSA. Gazprombank did not receive any official requests or notifications from U.S. justice authorities,"" the company said in a statement. 
Prosecutors said that in exchange for the bribes, Ortega helped companies gain ""priority status"" to loan money to oil joint ventures in which they were partners with PDVSA. 
Gazprombank said it had structured a loan financing of capital investments and operational costs of its Petrozamora joint venture with PDVSA in 2013, ""on the market conditions, without any preferences from Venezuelan side.""
""Such financing structure does not differ from usual financing practice by foreign investors,"" Gazprombank said in a statement. 
PDVSA in 2013 said it signed a deal with Gazprombank for $1 billion in financing for the Petrozamora joint venture.

Perenco on Thursday declined to comment. PDVSA has not responded to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the U.S. and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. 
Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world's two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. 
A steep decline in shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) further weighed down sentiment in the U.S. stock market after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations.
A senior official in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed as untrue a media report that said Trump was preparing a possible trade deal with China, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter. 
""There is a long way to go"" on negotiations, the unnamed official told CNBC's Eamon Javers, according to his tweet.
That erased earlier gains in the U.S. stock market and curtailed a rally in global shares that had lifted emerging market stocks up by their largest daily gain since 2016. 
In Europe, Germany's export-heavy DAX (GDAXI) had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.30 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.13 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 125.44 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,255.3, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 20.32 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,720.05 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 89.41 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,344.65.
Apple's shares tumbled 6.8 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations.
U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December.
Benchmark 10-year notes  last fell 13/32 in price to yield 3.1931 percent, from 3.144 percent late on Thursday. 
The dollar index (DXY), tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.05 percent, with the euro (EUR=) up 0.04 percent to $1.1411.
Oil prices were weighed down by a report that the U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after Washington re-imposes sanctions.

U.S. crude  fell 0.44 percent to $63.41 per barrel and Brent  was last at $73.04, up 0.21 percent on the day.

At 11:05 AM ET (14:05 GMT), the Dow Jones fell 83 points, or 0.33% to 25,242.0 points, the S&P 500 lost 14 points, or 0.50%, to 2,724.24 while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 115 points, or 1.63%.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweeted on Thursday that he had a “long and very good conversation” with Chinese President Xi Jinping with a “a heavy emphasis on trade”.
“Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina,” he said.
However, the Washington Times reported on Friday that Trump told the paper that he did not expect to reach a deal with China at the G-20.
U.S. stock indices turned negative as the report surfaced, with Nasdaq leading the losses.
Tech stocks were dragged lower by a disappointing guidance from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Shares tumbled 5.83%, leading decliners on the Dow.
A solid jobs report limited losses as traders learned that the U.S. economy produced 250,000 jobs in October.

The exchange's statement comes days after China's securities regulator said it would reduce ""unnecessary intervention"" in the market - representing a major change in the way the regulators respond to market volatility.
Beijing's practice of giving verbal messages or ""window guidance"" in the stock market has long drawn complaints from foreign investors, who said such things discriminated against some investors while favoring others.
The Shanghai bourse said in a statement on Friday that since a period of market weakness began in June, it has no longer resorted to this practice.
It also said it has largely refrained from other restrictive measures such as suspending trading accounts.
When it has come across activity such as excessive speculation, the exchange said it had mainly resorted to sending letters urging its members to flag trading risks to investors.

During a period of turmoil in Chinese markets from mid-2015 to early 2016, the securities regulator restricted selling activities by fund managers and blamed short-sellers for triggering a panic that sent ripples across global markets.

A Volkswagen spokesman on Friday told Reuters that a legal action had been filed by Broadcom against the German carmaker over a patent issue without confirming the size of the claim.
""Volkswagen has examined the claim and taken necessary action to protect its legal interests,"" the spokesman added. 
Spiegel magazine, which first reported the conflict on Friday, said it concerned the use of 18 patents on Broadcom semiconductors which Volkswagen uses for navigation and entertainment system in some of its cars. 
Broadcom earlier this year began legal action in the United States against Japan's Toyota (T:7203) and Panasonic (T:6752), among other firms, for alleged patent infringement.
Lawsuits against Volkswagen have been brought before patent courts in the German cities of Mannheim and Muenster, Spiegel said, adding that Broadcom threatened to seek a provisional ban on the production of the relevant Volkswagen models, as well as some models of its Audi (DE:NSUG) and Porsche brands.

With the price of crude in the third quarter up 44 percent from the same period a year ago, major oil companies' earnings have returned to levels not seen in as much as four years. 
Chevron topped analysts' estimates with third-quarter net income of $4.05 billion, or $2.11 a share, compared with $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
""Our strong financial results reflect higher production and crude oil prices coupled with a continued focus on efficiency and productivity,"" said Chief Executive Michael Wirth in a statement. 
Analysts were looking for the company to report $2.06 per share profit, according to I/B/E/S data on Refinitiv.
Shares rose 2 percent in premarket trading to $113.53. The stock declined 9 percent in October and was off 11 percent year to date through Thursday's close. 
Chevron's production rose to 2.96 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 2.72 million boed a year ago. 
Quarterly results included $930 million in one-time expenses for an asset impairment, a write-off and contract settlement offset by a $350 million gain from the sale of its South African refining and marketing operations, the company said. 
Profit in the company's downstream business, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, fell 24 percent reflecting lower margins and year-earlier gains on asset sales. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) posted strong third-quarter profits on Friday, citing strong prices for oil and natural gas.

China’s largest e-commerce company reported quarterly earnings well above analysts’ estimates, while also trimming its prediction for full-year sales by as much as 6 percent. Shares slid as much as 2.7 percent.
Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has warned that conflict between the world’s two largest economies could last 20 years, raising concerns about the toll that tensions would have on Alibaba and its core customers. Yet the Hangzhou-based company managed to record 54 percent revenue growth by adjusting its e-commerce formula and expanding into newer businesses like cloud computing. U.S. President Donald Trump is said to have asked his cabinet to draft terms for a potential trade deal.
“The fact Alibaba’s guiding down is telling, it means they’re seeing something,” said Mitchell Kim, an analyst with Kim Eng Securities. “It’s either that they see consumer confidence declining significantly, or merchant confidence declining significantly.”
Alibaba posted second-quarter earnings-per-share of 9.60 yuan ($1.40), well above the 7.43 yuan expected by analysts. However, for the fiscal year ending March, the company is now predicting revenue of 375 billion yuan to 383 billion yuan, equating to growth of as much as 53 percent versus the 60 percent it guided toward previously.
“Consumers see uncertainty in the future and are cutting back,” Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts. He pointed particularly to big-ticket items such as automobiles and home appliances, as well as consumer electronics.
Despite reducing its sales outlook, Alibaba said it will continue to invest in new sectors.
The closely watched customer management revenue, which includes the high-margin business of helping merchants with marketing, grew 25 percent -- down a tad from the previous quarter’s 26 percent. Other divisions however remained humming -- the cloud business grew 90 percent. Youku, its Netflix-style video service, more than doubled its average daily subscribers, while the international business -- a relatively smaller piece of the pie -- grew 55 percent.
Domestically, Alibaba’s main e-commerce platforms are grappling with a migration of smaller merchants to cheaper platforms such Pinduoduo Inc., backed by nemesis Tencent Holdings Ltd.
“Platforms like Pinduoduo are charging much lower in commissions, posing significant competition to Alibaba,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch.
Alibaba is trying to counter that by stepping up its marketing services and investing in its own grocery stores and delivery to boost sales.
The company is just over a week away from its annual Singles’ Day shopping festival, a litmus test of not just the company’s health but also China’s overall consumption. Chinese online retail sales growth is already slowing, to 24 percent in the third quarter from 36 percent in the second.
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, who succeeds Ma as chairman next year, will preside over the Nov. 11 event as it broadens the shopping categories to include purchases made in affiliated shopping malls and food deliveries.
“This is the third time in Alibaba’s 19-year history that we’ve encountered a setback in the global economy,” Zhang said. “The global economy is in a state of uncertainty.”

COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Denmark is widening its investigation of a massive stock trading scam, as the state attempts to recover $2 billion of tax reclaims it was tricked into paying.
The country's tax minister has asked the financial regulator to gather information from some large banks to help with the inquiry, as a series of probes around Europe into so-called dividend stripping gathers pace.
Danish authorities have already subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people they suspect of involvement, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe. 
Its tax authorities say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros by a similar ""cum-ex"" method. Other countries, such as Austria and Belgium, were also hit.
The schemes typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners - each entitled to a tax rebate. It cost some countries billions of euros when illicit rebates were granted.
Tax Minister Karsten Lauritzen has asked for three banks, Danske Bank, Nordea and SEB, to contribute information to the investigation. ""I'm not convinced the banks have lived up to their social responsibilities,"" Lauritzen told journalists on Thursday.
On Friday, those banks expressed willingness to help with the investigation but stressed they had not been involved in wrongdoing.
The country's financial watchdog told Reuters it would discuss the minister's request with the tax authorities ""as soon as possible"".
A spokesman for Danske said there had been no fraud involving the bank but that it would contribute ""documentation and knowledge"" to the investigation. 
Nordea said it would also help, although it had not been involved in Danish cum-ex trading. An SEB spokesman said there was no question of it being involved in a fraud.
European politicians have called for action to tackle dividend stripping after Reuters and other media revealed the trading schemes that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files"", coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv. 
In what is Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, prosecutors in Cologne are investigating banks involved in the trades, which secured illicit double tax rebates on dividend payouts. 
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to stamp out the practice.
Olaf Scholz, Germany's finance minister, has said that any tax reclaimed illicitly under dividend stripping schemes would have to be paid back. 
The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark has prompted other countries, including Austria and Belgium, to open their own investigations. They have discovered that they were also affected, but on a far smaller scale.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Ten EU countries call for clear debt-restructuring option in EU rules,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ten European Union finance ministers want any unsustainable public debt in the euro zone to undergo restructuring, with losses imposed on the private sector, before a public bailout is organized, a joint position paper by the 10 ministers said.
It comes amid growing concern that spending by Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, could trigger another debt crisis. Italy's proposed budget includes greater borrowing and spending despite its public debt, which amounts to 133 percent of gross domestic product.
The paper was drafted for a meeting on Monday of all EU finance ministers except Britain's, which will be devoted to changes to the euro zone bailout fund. It was signed by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Slovakia.
Although it did not sign, Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, is of the same opinion and Austria is also sympathetic.
The 19 countries that share the euro have a bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is a lender of last resort to governments that have lost market access. 
Talks are under way among the 27 countries that will remain in the EU after Britain leaves next year to give the ESM more powers to monitor economies so it can provide a bailout at short notice when a crisis hits.
But the 10 ministers also called for the ESM's role in debt restructuring to be spelled out more clearly. The topic has been shunned by Italy in discussions at deputy minister level.
""The current ESM treaty already recognizes the possibility of private sector involvement in exceptional circumstances and an amendment of the treaty should be used to reaffirm this principle,"" the paper of the ministers said. 
The ESM should verify the repayment capacity of the country before lending and restructure the debt if needed, it said. 
""In the unlikely situation where strict conditionality alone could not reasonably be expected to restore adequate repayment capacity, financial assistance would only be granted after measures to improve debt sustainability, taken in cooperation with existing creditors,"" it said.
The euro zone has so far helped organize only one debt restructuring, in Greece in 2012, to accompany a second bailout loan package for Athens.
But concern is growing over the planned debt increase in Italy, which already has 2.3 trillion-euro of public debt. Many euro zone officials say there is no political will to bail out such a huge economy should Rome lose market confidence.

(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell 6 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures.
The dip in Apple's shares to $208.50 knocked around $67 billion off its value, and put Amazon and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) back in the mix in the race among the United States' big tech players to be the world's most valuable company.
The Cupertino, California-based company blamed weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs for a disappointing forecast for sales in the run-up to Christmas that are crucial to results for consumer electronics producers.
Most analysts were still upbeat on fourth-quarter results, and there was no obvious fallout for rest of the FAANG group of major U.S. tech stocks. Shares in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) all rose on a generally buoyant Wall Street.
Eight brokerages cut their price targets for Apple, but only one - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) - cut its rating on the stock, to neutral from buy.
""Time for investors to adjust to the new disclosures,"" analysts from the brokerage said. ""Although the long term opportunity is significant, we expect near term pressure on shares.""
The move announced on Thursday to stop reporting unit sales data for iPhones, iPad and Mac computer products was widely criticized, with some arguing it meant Apple expected sales of iPhones have now peaked.
""While the company believes units are a less relevant metric, we strongly disagree – particularly since we believe iPhone units will begin to decline y/y as a result of higher average selling prices,"" Raymond James analysts said.

Apple shares were down 6.4 pct at $208.05 before the bell.

The company posted third-quarter net income of $6.24 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with $3.97 billion, or 93 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.23 a share profit, according to data from I/B/E/S on Refinitiv.
Its shares rose nearly 2 percent to $82.20 in pre-market trading. They are down 4.9 percent year-to-date on lower oil and gas production that, with the latest decline, has dropped in nine of the last 10 quarters. 
Results benefited from a $360-million tax benefit that added about 7 cents a share to earnings, said Brian Youngberg, an equity analyst at Edward Jones.
""It's a modestly positive report,"" said Youngberg. ""They had such a weak first half of the year, the bar was lower and they jumped over it."" 
Oil production fell 3 percent to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent and natural gas output dropped 4 percent, the company said. 
Earnings from the company's downstream unit, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, rose 72 percent to $1.64 billion, which Chief Executive Darren Woods said benefited from better operations and growing supplies of discounted shale oil from West Texas and crude from Western Canada.
With crude up 44 percent in the third quarter over a year-earlier, Exxon and other oil companies are minting profits again. Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and  BP  Plc (L:BP) reported profit of $3.8 billion in the period.

Peter Beyer, Berlin's coordinator for relations with North America said Germany needs to diversify its energy mix as North Sea gas runs out and insisted that a Russian pipeline vehemently opposed by Washington was needed.
Berlin's ties with the United States have been under immense strain since President Donald Trump took office, and the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would bring Russian gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, has been a particular concern.
""Germany's energy sources in the North Sea for example are running out and we have a responsibility to spread risks,"" he told Reuters on Friday, conceding that the pipeline would likely bring a sharpening of Washington's sanctions regime.
Washington has threatened to impose sanctions on companies that participate in the building of projects like Nord Stream 2, which U.S. officials say helps the Kremlin finance destabilizing activities around the world, as well as cutting Ukraine out of lucrative transit fees as it battles Moscow-backed separatists.
""I personally expect that we will see a sharpening of the (sanctions) guidelines at the beginning of the year,"" he said. ""Whether that means we actually get tougher sanctions I don't yet know.""
The U.S., which has become a major exporter of gas thanks to shale drilling, is keen to open new markets by ensuring energy net importers like industrial powerhouse Germany construct terminals capable of receiving liquefied gas.
Beyer said that U.S. LNG was still too expensive to be competitive with other energy sources, but that this would likely change as the market expanded, though it was not yet clear whether Berlin would provide financial support for the building of such a port, as many urge.

He added that Washington had escalated its willingness to threaten sanctions in pursuit of its foreign policy goals in recent months, including its attempts to hinder European companies trading with Iran.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian divers hunted on Friday for a second black box from an aircraft that crashed into the sea this week with the loss of all 189 people on board, as investigators tried to get data from a partly damaged recorder already found.
The Lion Air  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX, which only went into service in August, crashed on Monday into the Java Sea.
Air traffic control lost contact with it 13 minutes after it took off from the capital, Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
Searchers have found one black box and just one passenger has been identified from partial human remains recovered from the shallow waters.
""We haven’t downloaded the data because there are some broken parts in the black box,"" Haryo Satmiko, the deputy of the transport safety panel, said of the flight data recorder found on Thursday, adding that some of the damage was to a socket on the device.
Satimiko told Reuters investigators were awaiting advice from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board or Boeing.
The pilot of flight JT610 had asked for, and received, permission to turn back to Jakarta airport, but what went wrong remains a mystery.
Efforts are now focused on retrieving the second of the two black boxes, as the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are known, the head of Indonesia's transport safety committee said.
""The team have been hearing the 'ping' sound from another black box for two days,"" Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters.
The sea is only 30 m (98 ft) deep at the crash site but strong currents and nearby energy pipelines have hampered the search for the aircraft operated by the budget carrier.
While victims' relatives are desperate to know what happened, the investigation of the first crash of a Boeing 737 MAX is also the focus of scrutiny by the global aviation industry.
'WORK FAST'
Investigators said the damage suffered by the first data device reflected the severity of the impact.
Downloading the data on flight recorders can take as little as two hours but analyzing it can take weeks.
Results of a preliminary investigation will be made public after 30 days, one official on the investigation team said.
President Joko Widodo, visiting the search operation's headquarters at Jakarta's port, thanked rescue officials and the military involved and appealed for them to step up the search.
""I ask for you to use all your might, all the technology available, to work fast to find anything else,"" he said. 
He said he wanted investigators to determine the cause of the crash quickly so ""we can determine the next step"".
Relatives of the missing have been looking through personal items recovered from the sea including rows of shoes, backpacks and wallets.
Television footage showed an aircraft wheel being hoisted from the sea on Friday and a diver holding a piece of what appeared to be part of the fuselage bearing the Lion Air logo. 
The search and rescue agency said that 65 body bags with human remains had been taken to a police hospital where forensic doctors have been trying to identify victims.
Doctors have been taking DNA samples from relatives.

Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets but its safety record has been patchy. Its transport safety panel investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 07:42AM ET</span>",Trump's latest tariffs undercut his first trade salvo in solar,"By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In January, President Donald Trump fired the opening shot of his trade war, slapping tariffs on solar panel imports to boost U.S. manufacturing of a product long dominated by cheap foreign competition.
But other duties his administration has imposed since then are making the solar panel components more expensive - dampening the domestic panel manufacturing sector's initial hopes for expansion.
The conflicting impacts of his tariffs illustrate the pitfalls the administration faces in using broad protections for economic development - because tariffs meant to help one industry often undermine those shielding another.
Other examples include a levy on imported washing machines to help domestic manufacturers such as Whirlpool (N:WHR), the effect of which has since been undercut by separate tariffs on the imported steel and aluminum used to make them.
For the solar industry, the impact of Trump's tariffs for companies and jobs gets even more complex. 
The United States currently accounts for just a fraction of the fast-growing global panel manufacturing industry, a key reason why Trump moved to protect the U.S. sector. 
While the January tariff on panels initially boosted the U.S. manufacturing outlook, it dented the prospects for the panel installation business by making panels more expensive for consumers.
Now solar manufacturers - including four that said they would expand U.S. production after Trump's January announcement - are also taking a hit, this time from newer tariffs covering a range of Chinese-made components used in panel production. 
Two companies with U.S. operations - China’s Jinko Solar (N:JKS) and Silicon Valley startup Solaria - told Reuters they have scaled back initial growth plans as a result. 
""The impacts are generally very, very negative,"" Suvi Sharma, the chief executive of Solaria, told Reuters.
Jinko slashed a planned $410 million investment at a manufacturing facility in Florida to just $50 million, costing the city of Jacksonville some 600 prospective jobs, according to public disclosures filed by the city council. Solaria abandoned its hopes of boosting production this year at its plant in Fremont, California and adding 20 jobs.
Finished solar panels require scores of components, ranging from aluminum framing to transformers, solar glass and power inverters. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum early this year, and many of the other materials used in panels now also face duties as part of Trump's 10 percent levy on about $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect in September. The tax on those imports will rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the solar tariffs were designed with other duties in mind and that domestic solar panel manufacturers should consider buying their components from places other than China.
That could be difficult because China is the top source of cheap components. But some panel manufacturers say they are already sourcing panel components from countries other than China, including Korea’s LG, which is starting panel production in Alabama next year, and Canada’s Heliene, which started production in Minnesota in October.
Some component-makers are also shifting production out of China to serve U.S. manufacturers. Enphase Energy (O:ENPH), for example, said it will start making microinverters for the U.S. market in Mexico. Its rival, SolarEdge (O:SEDG), has said it would move some production to Romania and Hungary.
The $17 billion U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, most of them in installation and development and only about a fifth in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The Commerce Department’s senior renewable energy specialist, Cora Dickson, acknowledged at a September solar industry trade show that the tariffs impacting components pose a challenge for domestic panel manufacturers, but added they will be lifted once the U.S. and China come to better terms on trade. 
""It's not designed to cut off trade from China forever,"" she said at the Solar Power International conference in Anaheim, California. 
PULLING BACK ON INVESTMENTS
Solaria’s Sharma estimated that U.S. tariffs this year have increased the company’s U.S. production costs by about 30 percent – an amount equal to the original U.S. solar panel import duty.
That means that, instead of ramping up its Fremont, California factory to its full 40 MW of capacity as Solaria had planned this year, it has kept production constant at an unspecified level.
Jinko has seen its growth plans constrained by Trump administration tariffs on steel for factory construction, Chinese-made manufacturing equipment, said U.S. General Manager Nigel Cockroft. Certain parts for panel assembly are also ""limiting factors,” he said.
The public documents filed by Jacksonville's city council in January and March show Jinko's original $410 million investment plan for the Jacksonville facility would have produced some 800 jobs. The $50 million plan that replaced it will create 200.
Jinko declined to elaborate on the documents.
Sunpower (O:SPWR) - a major U.S.-based solar company that bought a manufacturing plant in Oregon after Trump’s initial panel import tariff - is another company feeling the pinch.
""We are certainly concerned,"" Suzanne Leta, the head of global market strategy at SunPower, said at the Solar Power International conference. 
The new tariffs are discouraging the kind of manufacturing expansion the original tariffs on imported panels were meant to encourage, she said. Leta did not say specifically how the component tariffs might affect SunPower’s domestic output, and the company declined further comment.
Other solar panel producers with U.S. operations contacted by Reuters - including Korea's LG, and Canada's Heliene - said they expected the impact of the new rounds of tariffs to be limited because of their particular supply chain dynamics. Another Canadian firm, Silfab Solar, expects ""slightly elevated costs"" at the U.S. factory in Bellingham, Washington it took over from Itek Energy LLC in October, according to spokesman Geoff Atkins.
For  First Solar Inc  (O:FSLR), which mostly manufactures panels in Asia but is expanding a factory in Ohio, tariffs pose a ""headwind"" for U.S. operations, Chief Executive Mark Widmar said on a conference call with analysts, citing higher costs for steel parts and aluminum frames.
COMPLAINTS FROM TESLA
Solar and electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) complained about the tariffs in a September letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, saying they “will hinder American innovation, expansion of companies, and the creation of more American jobs.”
The company declined to comment on the specific impact of the tariffs on its U.S. operations, including its solar manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York, where it is already facing technical challenges to increasing output. 
The Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA), the solar industry's primary trade group, said it had opposed the initial solar panel tariff in January to begin with because it expected the benefit for domestic manufacturing would fail to compensate for damage to the solar installation industry. 

Now, the impact of additional tariffs on components used in manufacturing are ""slowing down something we had pretty low expectations for to begin with.""

Boeing invested $33 million last year in a joint venture with the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) to oversee the plant, taking a majority stake. The plant, in the eastern city of Zhoushan, will install interiors and paint liveries.
Boeing's comments were first reported by Chinese media outlets on Friday after a media visit to the plant, and confirmed by a company spokesman. 
State-backed ThePaper.cn quoted Boeing China President John Bruns as saying that the factory will deliver only one aircraft in 2018 and then gradually increase output until it hits a delivery target of 100 planes a year. 
Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) are expanding their footprint in China as they vie for orders in the fast growing aviation market. Airbus has a A330 completion plant in the eastern city of Tianjin.
Boeing also renewed production contracts for the 737 with AVIC Aircraft (SZ:000768) and Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co Ltd, and recognized five new Chinese companies as eligible suppliers during a ceremony at Zhoushan, ThePaper.cn said. 

Analysts have expressed concerns that Boeing could eventually be affected by ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China although the planemaker's products have not been hit by Chinese tariffs.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>","Boeing eyes services M&A, small or big, in tussle with Airbus","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is looking for future deals ""small or big"" now that it has absorbed parts distributor KLX Inc, an executive told Reuters, as the world's largest planemaker tries to beat out rival Airbus (PA:AIR) in the highly profitable market for aircraft parts and services.
Boeing last month closed the KLX acquisition for $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt, its largest deal since merging with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
Now it expects further purchases to help it triple the revenue of its year-old Global Services division to $50 billion in a decade, the unit's chief executive Stan Deal told Reuters in an interview.
""When we come up with selective, complementary investments, whether it's small or big, we will make it,"" Deal said. 
""Our first thrust is organic,"" he added. ""We have plenty of things we can invest in organically to create growth.""
Both Boeing and rival Airbus are muscling deeper into the higher-margin market for repairs, maintenance and analytics services in a push that has rattled the aerospace supply chain.
Deal declined to specify a price range or geography for its next targets, but said any bolt-on acquisitions would expand beyond the ""technology or breadth inside of Boeing."" 
This could mean deals in areas such as avionics services, which is in increasing demand as airplanes become more equipped with complex electronic systems.
UNIFIED FRONT
Parts suppliers often reap the bulk of their profit in servicing jetliners over their multi-decade lifespan rather than when they are first assembled, and Deal said Boeing has this week launched fresh campaigns for new business with airlines and equipment manufacturers as a unified Boeing-KLX front. 
Boeing, which forecasts services to generate a third of the global aerospace industry's $7.6 trillion in revenue for the next 10 years, is not alone in wanting to dominate the segment.
Europe's Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenue from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said.
Boeing's deal with Wellington, Florida-based KLX, which supplies materials like fasteners, bearings, and hydraulic fluids globally, will bring anticipated annual cost savings of $70 million by 2021.
""We've already begun to see results along that line,"" Deal said. ""Over the course of a year we'll be collapsing (KLX's) IT infrastructure."" 

Boeing's proposed stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3), which still requires government and shareholder approvals, ""is part and parcel"" of the services growth push, too, Deal said.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",Investors bristle as Apple's iPhone data goes the way of its headphone jacks,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - First Apple Inc (O:AAPL) took away the headphone jack on its iPhones. Then it took away the home button.
And now, it has taken away a closely watched performance metric that it has disclosed to investors for 20 years.
The Cupertino, California-based company on Thursday said that it will stop reporting unit sales data for its iPhone, iPad and Mac computer products, the latter of which it has given out since 1998. Analysts and investors use the figures to calculate the average selling price of Apple's devices and gauge the health of the company. 
Apple said the data is less relevant to the strength of its business as customers bundle products, such as an iPhone paired with its wireless AirPods headphones, along with paid subscription services like Apple Music to listen to songs and iCloud storage for photos. Analysts were skeptical.
""Companies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple,"" said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research.
The move cost Apple dearly, helping to send shares down about 7 percent in after-hours trading. They later settled at $207.81, about 6.5 percent below their previous close. 
""Apple is a complex company with lot of moving parts,"" said analyst Ivan Fienseth from Tigress ""I think they need to give more transparency to their shareholders and not less."" 
But now, Apple will give cost-of-sales data for both its total product businesses and its total services business, which will let investors evaluate a gross margin for both. In the past, Apple gave only an overall gross margin figure for the company.
The new numbers are important for two reasons. First, they will show just how lucrative Apple's hardware business really is. But more importantly, for the first time they give margin information on Apple's services business, which reached $10 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 17 percent.
Many of Apple's fastest-growing businesses are subscription based, like its $9.99 a month Apple Music service. And investors tend to value subscription business through a combination of their revenue growth rate and margins - information that Apple investors will now have, said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of  Zuora Inc  (N:ZUO), a company that helps subscription businesses track their finances.
But one problem Apple investors will face is not knowing what the margin mix is within the services business. Some parts of it, like iCloud storage, are likely lucrative, but others, like Apple Music, are probably less so because Apple has to pay music licenses costs and competes with rival  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT).

""You would value the music business with one (revenue) multiple closer to Spotify, and the cloud business with a (subscription software) multiple,"" said Tzuo. ""Having some sense of which business is growing faster would be nice.""

The death of the critic of the Saudi government was “really bad,” the chief executive officer of the electric carmaker told Recode in an interview, when he was asked about taking Saudi money now.
Interest for an investment in Tesla from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund prompted Musk to tweet in August he had the funding secured to buy out investors and take Tesla private. The push fell apart after Musk failed to line up funding, ensuing an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last month, Saudi Arabia admitted Khashoggi had been killed inside the country’s consulate in Istanbul, prompting international outrage."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) has been categorized as ""fragile"" in a European Central Bank test of European lenders, with its capital ratio falling below a level set by regulators in an ""adverse"" scenario, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Friday.
Carige's problems are widely known and the ECB has already taken them into account in asking the Genoa-based bank to come up with a capital conservation plan by the end of this month, the Italian newspaper said.
Banca Carige, which was not immediately available to comment, is not among the 48 major European banks whose European Banking Authority (EBA) stress test results are due to be published at 1700 GMT on Friday.
The ECB declined to comment on the Il Sole report, which said Carige's CET1 capital ratio would fall below the threshold of 5.5 percent in the ""adverse"" scenario against which regulators are testing banks' resilience.
The tests measure banks' ability to withstand theoretical market shocks like a rise in political uncertainty against a backdrop of falling economic growth, a disorderly Brexit or a sell-off in government bonds and property.
Several Italian newspapers reported that all the four Italian lenders tested by the EBA --  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), UniCredit (MI:CRDI), UBI Banca (MI:UBI) and Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) -- had cleared the tests without problems. 
While there is no formal pass/fail mark, investors will check how much core capital lenders hold against the threshold of 5.5 percent under the test's toughest scenario.
No bank among the major European Union lenders being tested is expected to fall below the 5.5 percent mark, but banks that are too close may come under market pressure.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",European shares join global trade war relief rally,"By Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares joined a global relief rally on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump fueled hopes among investors that a deal to end a prolonged dispute over trade could be made with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.9 percent by 0936 GMT, hitting its highest since Oct. 10, although companies and indexes most exposed to trade surged further.
""The trade war has been partly to blame for the recent equities rout, so any signs that the two powers are making progress will encourage investors to put risk back on the table and pick up stocks at bargain levels"", wrote Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group. 
Fears of a full-blown trade war, rising U.S. bond yields, slowing Chinese growth, political risk in the form of Brexit or Italy's populist government have all been blamed for last month ""red October"" during which indexes worldwide sustained some of their worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis.
Markets' new found optimism is however pushing European shares up over four percent this week, their best performance since December 2016. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) jumped 1.6 percent, in what would be its biggest daily rise since July, lifted by the big exporters among its constituents, such as car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), up 4 percent. 
The European automotive index (SXAP) was the best performing one, jumping 3.5 percent and all other sectors were in positive territory except for a minority of defensive sectors. Both telecoms or utilities traded slightly or on the verge of negative territory. 
Boosted by a upgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), France's  Kering  (PA:PRTP) topped the euro zone blue chip index (STOXX50E) with a 5.5 percent rise. Other luxury stocks such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) or  Burberry  (L:BRBY) did well, up 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent. 
Following Asia's lead, European tech stocks shrugged off Apple's (O:AAPL) disappointing results, which saw the iPhone marker's shares tumbled about seven percent after the bell.
Apple supplier AMS however was down 5.3 percent and suffered the worst losses in the pan-European index. 
The banking sector (SX7P) was showing no angst about the results of European stress tests which will be divulged after the close.

Italian lenders are under the spotlight with their heavy exposure to sovereign Italian debt, which is suffering from the populist government’s spending plans and its row with the EU's executive body.

621,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Apple Bulls Balk at Surprise End to Unit Sales Data; Shares Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). threw a curve ball to analysts, ending the release of unit-sales data in a decision that came “out of left field.”
At one point in after-hours trading on Thursday, Apple’s stock was down 7.7 percent, a decline that would mark the worst performance off the back of an earnings release in more than four years if something similar transpires on Friday.
At the center of the reaction on Wall Street was a two-pronged debate: Why is the world’s biggest company going to hold back some sales data, and are there lingering concerns about growth for Apple in China and other emerging markets?
Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:
Wedbush Securities, Dan Ives
“It’s definitely something that came out of left field. As they’re going through this massive product cycle, it’s a surprise for investors because transparency is sort of key here. Not breaking out unit sales is going to be a pretty controversial issue.”
Forrester Research, Julie Ask
“Because devices have been Apple’s history for so long, there’s a set of expectations around those sort of products. But growth in the future is going to be slower in some ways.
“When you look at the upgrade cycles, those are slowing. You have to be a user of games, or what I would call the more demanding applications on the phone, to really need that upgrade. I don’t need an iPhone X to do e-mail, but you do if you want to play the latest video games.
“When they do get a customer, especially for a subscription service, that’s steady and that goes long term. But services are a lot more dependent on ecosystem partners. So whether it’s Apple Pay, or it’s music, or it’s media, Apple can’t just flip a switch and make that all happen. It’s grinding that out day by day to sign up for partners, negotiate deals, get more services. It’s something that grows much more slowly and more organically, it’s not about a big bang ‘Wow, I have to have that new product once a year.’”
Asymco, Horace Dediu
“We’re a little disappointed on the guidance. It looks to be, perhaps, indicating emerging market or China slowdowns and frankly, considering the product mix they have, it’s a flat forecast with zero growth in the iPhone.
“We are seeing a little bit less enthusiasm from management. Just two days ago we had new products -- meat and potato products -- these products that are middle of the market. Not to see that reflected in guidance is a little disappointing.
“There’s a question around whether the XR will be a home run or not.”
Bloomberg Intelligence, John Butler
“Overall the quarter was decent and I wouldn’t say the guidance was disastrous. It tends to be a management that’s a little bit conservative, so my first thought when I saw the numbers was that they’re being a bit conservative.
“The only thing that jumped out at me that was a little bit light was the services number. Concern in services is sort of like the iPhone itself. There are elements in there that are -- I don’t want to say aging -- but they have the potential to slow a bit. App-store sales are slowing a little bit, iCloud is getting to be a mature product. Apple Care, same thing.
“They have a lot of work to do, to plant some seeds for new services.”
RBC Capital, Amit Daryanani
“The bull thesis is more diluted,” though he’s sticking with an outperform rating.
“Gross-margins have potential to inflect higher through FY19 as memory tailwinds and product ramp inefficiencies start to ease.”
Loup Ventures, Gene Munster
“The new reporting methodology is Apple’s attempt to get investors to think of their entire business as a service (including hardware). This move should not be a surprise, given Apple’s efforts over the past four years to encourage investors to look more at its services segment and, separately, to measure the iPhone on an annual basis rather than quarterly. It will likely take a year for investors to embrace the new reporting methodology.
“Ultimately, this is a good thing for Apple investors. The new reporting method will force the Street to think about Apple’s business as a stable and growing service, which should yield a higher earnings multiple in the long run.”"
622,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",China hopes trade expo will highlight import clout as U.S. dispute rages,"By John Ruwitch and Chen Aizhu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China, dubbed 'the workshop of the world' for its sprawling supply chains and huge export capacity, is hoping to manufacture something new next week at a huge trade fair in Shanghai next week: import orders.
The Nov. 5-10 China International Import Expo, or CIIE, is an attempt by Beijing to counter mounting criticism of its trade and business practices by bringing thousands of foreign companies together with Chinese buyers to demonstrate the importing potential of the world's no.2 economy.
At its core, the event is symbolic. 
When Chinese President Xi Jinping opens the expo with a speech on Monday morning, few expect him to announce bold new policies of the kind that many foreign governments and businesses have been seeking.
Instead, people involved in planning meetings have said they expect state-owned companies to arrive with orders to do deals, possibly even with quotas, so that the expo will end with China something to show the world.
No officials from the United States -- China's top trading partner -- will be present as their trade dispute rages, but over 100 U.S. firms will be exhibiting their wares.
With political pressure to deliver, some deals are likely to be toothless memoranda while others will re-hash previous orders, executives and diplomats say.
Qatargas and China's CNPC, for example, are expected to sign a supply contract that formalizes a billion deal agreed in September, according to an energy executive with direct knowledge of the matter.
""It's a protocol signing, to show support to the trade fair,"" said the executive. The long-term contract is worth roughly $39 billion based on current spot market prices.
CNPC is also expected to sign at the expo an oil supply deal for 2019 with Saudi Aramco, a regular deal the parties normally review and renew annually around November, said the executive.
Both CNPC and Qatargas did not immediately respond to request for comment.
A similar agreement is likely from state-owned China National Chemicals Corp, or ChemChina, for one of its annual crude oil and refined fuel agreements, said a separate trading executive with knowledge of the matter.
BIG DEAL
Presidents or prime ministers from 18 countries are traveling to Shanghai for the event, ranging from Russia and Pakistan to the Cook Islands, though none from major Western nations. Government ministers from several other countries are also coming.
The European Union, meanwhile, pressed China to take concrete steps to further open its market to foreign firms and provide a level playing field.
Several roads in Shanghai have been repaved ahead of the event, and security has been beefed up.
Some Western diplomats and businesses have been quietly critical of whole idea of the expo, which they see as a propaganda stunt.
""Here are all of these foreigners bringing their spices for the emperor,"" said one person.
But Xu Bin, a professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said he thinks China's leaders have come to realize this year they may ultimately be unable to appease all concerns.
""I think Xi Jinping would not expect any positive reaction from Western countries this time, or in the near future,"" he said.
""But he still wants to do it to show the relatively poor countries and even rich countries that, look, you know, we are going to buy these things from the world. Do you want a share?""
Exhibitors from around 140 countries and regions will be on hand, including 404 from Japan, the most of any country. From the United States, some 136 exhibitors will attend, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Dell Inc, Ford and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
A handful of countries are being represented by a single exhibitor selling one product. 
For Iraq, it's crude oil. Iran, saffron. Jamaica will be marketing it's famed blue mountain coffee and Chad is selling bauxite. Tiny São Tomé is selling package holidays.
The expo may symbolize China's willingness to import more, but at a practical level, companies that don't have China experience may be in for a shock, said a Latin American diplomat.
""People think they are going to come here with meat or chicken and start importing it tomorrow. That's not going to happen,"" he said. ""It doesn't work like that here.""

623,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Bayer CEO says would consider glyphosate settlement depending on costs,"By Tina Bellon
ST. LOUIS, Mo. (Reuters) - Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn) chief executive said this week the company might consider settling lawsuits over Monsanto's glyphosate-containing weed-killers depending on how high court costs rise, but stressed it remained focused on defending the combined company against claims they cause cancer.
Bayer acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) this year for $63 billion.
""If we can settle nuisances at some point where the defense costs in preparing cases are higher than potential settlement amounts, we will of course consider it from an economic standpoint,"" CEO Werner Baumann told reporters when asked whether there was any scenario in which Bayer would consider settling. 
He added: ""We will resolutely and with all means defend ourselves in this (glyphosate) litigation.""
Baumann was speaking on Monday to German media invited to visit Bayer's new operations in the former research and development facilities of Monsanto in St. Louis, Missouri. The remarks, made on Monday, were embargoed to the end of the week to allow media to return home.
Shares in Bayer have lost 25 percent in value since Aug. 10, when a San Francisco jury awarded $289 million to Dewayne Johnson on grounds Monsanto failed to warn the school groundskeeper and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by glyphosate-based RoundUp and Ranger Pro.
Johnson has terminal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that he alleges was caused by the herbicides.
A judge later reduced the award to $78 million. 
Bayer denies that glyphosate causes cancer and says decades of scientific studies and real-world use have shown the chemical to be safe for human use. The company is appealing the findings.
The number of glyphosate cases that Bayer faces across the United States has jumped to more than 8,700, prompting concerns among investors about the impact of litigation costs on Bayer's bottom line.
Baumann expressed confidence that Bayer could handle the litigation, and cited its ""inexpensive"" $12 million settlement of 4,000 lawsuits over its contraceptive Mirena device.
Bayer also won five of six trials over its best-selling bloodthinner Xarelto, over which it faces 24,000 U.S. lawsuits. The sixth jury found in favor of a plaintiff, but a judge later overturned the decision. 
""Due to our exposure as a pharmaceutical company, we have the experience to defend those (glyphosate) cases,"" he said.
Baumann said the company's legal strategy had been revised following the integration of Bayer and Monsanto in mid-August.
He declined to provide details, but recent court filings reveal some of the steps the company has taken.
Last week, Bayer added the attorneys from law firm Arnold & Portner who won the Xarelto cases for the company to its glyphosate defense team. 
It is also trying to change the juror selection process for upcoming trials.
In filings last week in San Francisco federal court, where a new glyphosate trial is scheduled to begin on Feb. 25, 2019, Bayer said the ""jury pool likely has grown more hostile"" due to negative media coverage following the Johnson verdict.
Michael Miller, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, said the company's claims were ""hypocritical beyond belief"" given its own efforts to control the message on glyphosate, most recently in a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post.

Bayer has asked U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who is overseeing the San Francisco case and some 580 others, to significantly expand the jury pool and question prospective jurors about their knowledge of the media coverage of the cases. Chhabria is expected to decide on the requests in December.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>",AT&T's WarnerMedia accuses DOJ with 'collaborating' with Dish in HBO dispute,"By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's WarnerMedia has accused the U.S. Department of Justice of ""collaborating"" with Dish Network Corp in a high profile dispute over carrying HBO and Cinemax.
For the first time in its 40-year history, Warner Media's HBO, known for its award winning TV series ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Sopranos,"" went dark on Dish's satellite television service on Thursday after a disagreement over a new distribution deal.
About 2.5 million of Dish's 13 million customers subscribe to HBO or Cinemax, according to one person familiar with the matter. AT&T also owns DirecTV, a satellite TV rival to Dish.
WarnerMedia said it had offered to extend the contract to continue discussing a new deal but Dish executives declined to negotiate further.
""Dish’s proposals and actions made it clear they never intended to seriously negotiate an agreement,"" said Simon Sutton, HBO President and Chief Revenue Officer. 
The dispute could be a public relations blow to AT&T, which is heading back into court in December when oral arguments begin in the DOJ's appeal of the antitrust decision approving the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier's $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner.
""This behavior, unfortunately, is consistent with what the Department of Justice predicted would result from the merger,"" a DOJ representative said. ""We are hopeful the Court of Appeals will correct the errors of the District Court.” 
The Justice Department's statement was amplified by Fox Business Network journalist Charlie Gasparino's tweet on the matter.
AT&T fired back: “The Department of Justice collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our merger,"" a WarnerMedia spokesman said in a statement. ""That collaboration continues to this day with Dish’s tactical decision to drop HBO – not the other way around. DOJ failed to prove its claims about HBO at trial and then abandoned them on appeal.”
Dish declined comment on the accusation.
""The merger created for AT&T immense power over consumers,"" said Andy LeCuyer, DISH senior vice president of programming, in a prepared statement. ""It seems AT&T is implementing a new strategy to shut off its recently acquired content from other distributors."" 
Dish testified against the deal in March, arguing that AT&T's concession to get the deal done was not strong enough to protect competitors.

630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",China State-Owned Company Charged With Micron Secrets Theft,"(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese state-owned company was charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets of U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). as the Justice Department steps up actions against China in cases of suspected economic espionage.
Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. and Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp. were indicted in California along with three individuals, the Justice Department said Thursday. The U.S. also sued to stop the companies from exporting to America any products that were created using the trade secrets.
Intellectual property theft is among the Trump administration’s chief complaints against China as it wages a trade war that’s rattled global markets and seen the world’s two largest economies slap tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods. On Monday, the Commerce Department restricted exports to Jinhua, one of several high-profile government-backed companies at the vanguard of China’s effort to become a major player in global semiconductors.
“Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing, and it has been increasing rapidly,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a press conference in Washington. “It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations. International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop.”
A representative for Jinhua declined to comment but said the company will make an announcement “when the time is right.” UMC said it regretted not having the opportunity to discuss the matter with U.S. authorities and will respond to the allegations accordingly, adding it expected no impact from the charges on its finances or business. Its shares fell as much as 2.9 percent Friday.
Accusations that China unfairly acquires technology are at the heart of escalating U.S.-Chinese tensions, along with a plan by the world’s second largest economy to achieve supremacy in a plethora of future technologies.
The latest case was made public as the Justice Department announced a new initiative to respond to Chinese efforts to obtain U.S. technology and trade secrets, whether through hacking or theft by insiders. Sessions said the department’s National Security Division, led by John Demers, along with the FBI and a group of U.S. Attorneys will step up enforcement.
The charges against Jinhua and UMC follow a string of government cases against individuals accused of attempting to steal information on behalf of China. On Tuesday, the U.S. said Chinese intelligence officers worked with hackers and company insiders to acquire commercial aviation technology.
China’s trying to reduce a reliance on some $200 billion of annual semiconductor imports -- about as much as it spends on importing oil. It isn’t home to even one of the top 10 producers of the crucial electronic components. The memory chip market at issue in Thursday’s case has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Micron and its two Korean rivals, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and SK Hynix Inc., who have enjoyed record profits from the technology essential to everything from computers to smartphones. China didn’t possess DRAM capabilities before the alleged theft but had identified its development as a national economic priority, the U.S. said.
Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise funded by the Chinese government and established to design and manufacture dynamic random-access memory chips, or DRAM. The U.S. actions risks choking off supply of the crucial American components it needs and jeopardizing a $5.7 billion wafer-making factory it’s building on the country’s southeastern coast.
Billions Invested
“Micron has invested billions of dollars over decades to develop its intellectual property,” Joel Poppen, Micron’s general counsel, said in an emailed statement. “The actions announced today reinforce that criminal misappropriation will be appropriately addressed.”
Micron, based in Idaho, is the only U.S.-based company that manufactures DRAM. Prosecutors said Chen Zhengkun, also known as Stephen Chen, the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, resigned in 2015 and began working at UMC. While there, he arranged an agreement between UMC and Jinhua in which UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Jinhua to mass-produce, and the technology would be jointly shared by the companies.
Chen recruited numerous employees of the Micron subsidiary to work with him at UMC, according to the U.S., including He Jianting, also known as J.T. Ho, and Wang Yungming, also known as Kenny Wang. He and Wang both stole several Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM, the U.S. said.
“The Chinese government’s complicity in intellectual property theft hurts American manufacturers, workers, and consumers, and undermines the ability of U.S. businesses to operate in China,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in an emailed statement.
Micron last year sued UMC and Jinhua, claiming they stole trade secrets. UMC then took legal action against Micron in January, alleging that the company infringed on patents in China related to memory storage and other products. In July, a Chinese court banned Micron chip sales in the country, but the American company said that moratorium affected just 1 percent of its annual revenue.
The criminal case is U.S. v. United Microelectronics Corp., 3:18-cr-00465, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). The civil case is U.S v. United Microelectronics Corp., 5:18-cv-06643, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).

631,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks Are Sending a Scary Signal About the Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- As exporters feel the heat of the trade war, China’s powerful domestic-consumption engine was supposed to provide some protection for investors in the nation’s stocks.
That’s not working out so well. A narrative that’s captured traders’ attention in recent weeks has been a “consumption downgrade” in the world’s second-biggest economy. With official data already showing retail sales growth slowing, investor alarm increased when China’s biggest liquor maker, Kweichow Moutai Co., reported its weakest profit expansion in almost three years.
Moutai alone lost 212 billion yuan ($30 billion) in market value over six days last month. And stocks of companies that sell less discretionary items have done even worse. The Shenzhen CSI 300 Consumer Staples Index slid 22 percent in October, its worst month since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, is among those who have bailed on China’s consumer story for now. He sold off his portfolio of those stocks earlier this year, in favor of financials.
“We haven’t figured out the reason clearly” for the apparent changes in spending habits, Dai said. Among the explanations market players cite:
The earnings from Moutai, which makes the baijiu liquor that’s often prized as a luxury gift, were “concrete proof of China’s consumption-growth slowdown,” Dai said. The next key tests will be Single’s Day, a shopping bonanza promoted by online retailing giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., and spending over the lunar new year holidays, he said.
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts remain cautious on the prospects for spending during Single’s Day, noting that Chinese online appliance sales were weak in October.
Investors aren’t the only ones worried about China’s consumers. Authorities are taking steps to shore up spending -- all the more so with trade tensions sending manufacturing gauges to the weakest levels since the economy’s 2015-2016 hard-landing scare.
China’s Politburo says more aid is coming on the domestic front -- read more here.
A slowing auto market has been one major reason for the deceleration in retail sales this year, and China’s top economic planning body is proposing to halve the tax on car purchases to 5 percent, Bloomberg News has reported. Personal income-tax cuts are also on the table.
“There are likely to be more actions,” predicted Laura Wang, a China equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Hong Kong. “For now we still look at this as a relatively short-term cyclical-consumption momentum slowdown instead of a longer-term structural decline,” she said. Improvements could come as soon as the first quarter of 2019, Wang said.
Still, Wang recommends tilting toward materials and energy companies at the moment. “We do not recommend adding exposure to broad consumption-related sectors,” such as autos and retailing, she said.
Among the consumer-related companies that showcase the reason for caution:
Chinese consumer stocks have wiped out $302 billion in market value as of Thursday from June 12, when the discretionary and staples sectors of the CSI 300 Index reached recent highs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“People haven’t been this pessimistic in over a decade -- consumers’ confidence is weak and they dare not spend money,” said Jinghua Lin, an analyst at Capital Securities Corp. “We may have to wait until the end of mid-term elections in November and the G-20 meeting” for any shift in sentiment, Lin said, referring to next week’s U.S. congressional elections and the subsequent planned meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 09:58PM ET</span>","Apple warns on holiday sales, sending value below $1 trillion","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations, which Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed on weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs.
The disappointing forecast by the world's most valuable technology company helped send shares down as much as 7 percent, taking roughly $70 billion off Apple's market value and forcing that value below $1 trillion. The forecast could also deepen concerns for technology companies that saw a sell-off after misses by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Apple said it expects between $89 billion and $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ending in December, with a midpoint of $91 billion coming in below Wall Street expectations of $93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Cook in an interview with Reuters said that Apple is ""seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets."" He later told investors on a conference call that weak markets included Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey. Sales were flat in the fourth quarter in India, Cook said.
""Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth,"" Cook said on the call.
Executives said they also would quit giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, leading to a further drop in the share price, since iPhone unit sales was long the key indicator of quarterly success. 
Withholding that number will make it impossible to calculate the average selling price of phones, another key measure.
Apple executives said unit sales are becoming less relevant as customers buy bundled products that include subscription services like Apple Music. 
Apple said it would start giving cost-of-sales data for its services business, an important metric for subscription businesses. But investors reacted negatively.
""Companies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple,"" said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research.
For the quarter ended in September, Apple brought in $62.9 billion in revenue and $2.91 per share in profits, beating expectations of $61.5 billion and $2.79, respectively.
Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet.
""Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,"" said George Salmon, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”
In an interview with Reuters, Cook said his caution on holiday sales was in part due to Apple's earlier-than-normal launch of its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max. 
Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple's sales forecast. 
Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are produced by only a handful of suppliers.
Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said that China trade issues could be making it difficult for Apple to get the supplies it needs. ""As for emerging markets slowing, that's also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,"" he said.
But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region.
Apple's cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) had been up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year. 
Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company's services business as consumer markets become saturated with smartphones.
Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

For its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 09:28PM ET</span>",Europe's top banks in EU stress test spotlight,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top banks will learn on Friday how they have fared in their latest stress test, which could require some to raise capital or shed assets, with Italian lenders expected to come under close scrutiny. 
The European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Union's banking watchdog, is due to publish the results of 48 banks at 1700 GMT, in what is being touted as its toughest test since the exercise began in 2009.
While there is no pass/fail mark, supervisors will determine how much capital lenders should be holding or which risky assets should be sold. As well as the Italian banks, analysts expect  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Germany's biggest lender, to be closely watched after three years of losses.
The health check was implemented to identify any capital holes and avoid government bailouts like those during the financial crisis.
This time the tests measure banks' ability to withstand theoretical market shocks like a rise in political uncertainty against a backdrop of falling economic growth, a disorderly Brexit or a sell-off in government bonds and property. 
Investors will focus on how much core capital banks hold against a 5.5 percent level under the most ""adverse"" scenario.
While no bank is expected to fall below this mark, those that are seen as too close may come under market pressure.
EUROPE LAGS
Europe's banks still lag U.S. counterparts in profitability, quality of loans and cost discipline and the region's banking index (SX7P) has lost more than 20 percent this year.
Thirty-three of the banks in the test are in the euro zone, where the main supervisor is the European Central Bank, which is separately testing a further 60 smaller banks. Some of these are struggling, but their results will not be published.
The results could heighten concerns over Italy's banks, which have come under pressure because of a drop in the value of their large holdings of Italian debt. Banco BPM's (MI:BAMI) results are being closely monitored because its capital buffer is lower than rivals.
Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) performed worst in the last test in 2016 and has since been bailed out by Rome. But along with lenders from Greece and Portugal, it is not included this time.
""I would not expect the extreme results that we saw in 2016 when Monte dei Paschi was such an outlier,"" Daniel Quinten, co-head of KPMG's ECB office in Frankfurt, said.
This year's EBA test will include a new accounting rule that forces banks to make provisions much earlier for souring loans.

There are 673 bond issues on ballots in 38 states totaling nearly $76.3 billion, the biggest amount for a November general election since 2006, according to near-final data from Ipreo by IHS Markit.

The biggest concentration of bonds, $34.9 billion split between 126 measures, will appear on ballots in California, by far the largest U.S. state in population. Voters in the Golden State will consider nearly $16.4 billion of bonds - in four state-wide referendums - to fund water projects, housing and children's hospitals.
TAX POLICY CHANGES 
In addition, Californians will vote on repealing a 2017 hike in gasoline taxes and vehicle fees aimed at raising $5.1 billion a year for transportation projects. The measure would also require voter approval to impose future transportation-related tax and fee increases. 
Ballots in other states also include questions aimed at reining in taxes.
""Voters often like the idea of enacting limits on their government's ability to raise revenues, but from our perspective those kinds of constraints reduce financial flexibility and can certainly create problems for state governments,"" Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in an interview on Thursday.
Florida's legislature put a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot mandating a two-thirds vote by each legislative chamber to pass new or increased taxes or fees.
""If approved, a higher legislative hurdle to approve increases to existing revenue and taxes would slightly weaken our view of revenue structure flexibility in the state's fiscal policy framework,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said in a July report.
In Oregon, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would extend an existing three-fifths legislative vote for tax increases to include revenue raised by fees or through changes to or the elimination of tax breaks.
In North Carolina, where the personal income tax rate is 5.499 percent, the legislature put a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that would lower the maximum tax rate to 7 percent from 10 percent. A proposed constitutional amendment in Indiana would mandate balanced state budgets unless a two-thirds majority vote by the legislature suspends the requirement.
The taxation of groceries is the focus of ballot measures in two states. Oregon voters will vote on a constitutional amendment prohibiting the state and local governments from imposing a tax or fee on the sale or distribution of eatable or drinkable groceries.
In Washington state, a campaign in support of a ballot initiative to ban new or increased local government taxation of food and beverages bought in stores has been largely funded by soft-drink makers, including  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) and PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP). If approved, Seattle's existing tax on sweetened beverages would remain in place.
HEALTH, TRANSPORTATION AND EDUCATION
Voters in three states - Idaho, Nebraska and Utah - will be asked to expand Medicaid, the state and federal healthcare program for low-income residents.
Colorado voters will choose between two competing measures to fund transportation. One measure seeks to increase the state sales tax rate to 3.52 percent from 2.9 percent for 20 years to back $6 billion of bonds. Another authorizes $3.5 billion of bonds without specifying a revenue source.
There are several state-wide measures to boost education funding. Colorado would hike its corporate income tax rate and individual rates for residents earning over $150,000 to generate $1.6 billion a year for primary and secondary schools under a proposed constitutional amendment.
Maryland voters will decide whether to allocate an increasing amount of gambling revenue every year to public education starting in fiscal 2020. Michigan's K-12 schools would receive a portion of revenue from a tax on marijuana sales if voters agree to legalize recreational use of the drug.

A Hawaii measure would impose a surcharge on residential investment property for schools, while South Dakota voters will vote on increasing a tobacco products excise tax to raise money for the state's four technical institutes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management said on Thursday that starting next year, it will give advisers more credit toward earning bonuses for recruiting clients worth $25 million than it will for recruiting clients who have less money.
The firm's 2019 compensation plan introduces a credit system that rewards brokers with four credits for new clients who have $25 million or more in assets, three credits for clients with $10 million- $25 million, two credits for clients with $2.5 million - $10 million and one credit for clients with $250,000 - $2.5 million. 
It is an evolution from the carrot and stick approach introduced in the firm's 2018 compensation plan, which rewarded brokers for recruiting more new clients and penalized them, by docking their base pay, for failing to recruit a minimum number. 
Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, said the 2018 plan worked so well at boosting new client acquisition that Merrill is on the hook to pay its brokers more than it planned.
""We are paying out more than we anticipated, and we are happy about it because we are seeing more progress on client acquisition and net flows,"" Sieg said on a call with reporters. 
Sieg said they expect to pay more in overall compensation again in 2019.
""Our focus as a management team is to see that increase does not exceed the increase in revenue year over year,"" he said.
Like other Wall Street brokerages, Merrill Lynch pays its advisers a base amount that is a percentage of the annual revenue the broker earns. 
In 2018, the firm started giving advisers an extra percent for growing net new assets by 5 percent, and an additional percent if they recruited five new clients worth at least $250,000 or two new clients worth $10 million.
If advisers did not grow new assets by at least 2.5 percent this year, they lost 1 percent of base pay and lost an additional percent if they failed to bring in three new clients with $250,000 or one client with $10 million. 
The net new asset growth requirements remain the same in 2019.
However, brokers will have to recruit wealthier clients to keep their base pay. Brokers must earn at least four credits, which could be four clients with $250,000 or one client with $25 million.
Thus far in 2018, advisers recruited on average 5 new clients each.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed the central claim in lawsuits accusing five food producers and retailers of deceiving consumers by using ""100% Grated Parmesan Cheese"" labels to describe products that contained cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp.
U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago found a lack of proof that the labels would mislead reasonable consumers into thinking the products were 100 percent cheese, despite evidence that two linguistics professors and the ""vast majority"" consumers in a recent survey thought so.
The judge allowed some state consumer protection claims against Albertsons Cos, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc over ingredient lists that said cellulose was used to prevent ""caking,"" when it was also used as filler.
He dismissed all claims against two other retailers, Publix Super Markets Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
The plaintiffs in the proposed class actions said that they overpaid for what they thought was 100 percent cheese, and sought a variety of damages.
Their lawyer, Ben Barnow, declined to comment because the litigation was still pending, according to his office.
Kraft Heinz, in a statement, said it was pleased the judge found reasonable consumers would not be confused ""when the ingredient line clearly lists cellulose powder,"" and said it will defend against the rest of its lawsuit.
The other defendants had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Feinerman had dismissed the lawsuits in August 2017, but let the plaintiffs amend their cases.
In his earlier ruling, he had said ""100% Grated Parmesan Cheese"" was ambiguous, because it could mean a product contained 100 percent cheese, or that 100 percent of the cheese was parmesan, or that the parmesan was 100 percent grated.
The new evidence did not change his view.
Feinerman called the survey ""valueless,"" in part because it showed that some consumers did not believe the products were 100 percent cheese.
He also said reasonable consumers did not ""approach or interpret language in the manner of a linguistics professor.""
Some 50 lawsuits had been filed in the litigation, which began in early 2016, before being consolidated.

The case is In re: 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 16-05802.

640,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>",Google's '#metoo' moment: Workers walk out over women's rights,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Paresh Dave
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - Thousands of Google employees around the world briefly walked off their jobs on Thursday to protest the company's response to sexual harassment and demand that the world's largest search engine address rising concerns about workplace inequality.
The protests took place in waves, beginning in Asia and then streaming across Europe and North America, with the final wave occurring at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.
The protests, which drew Google contract workers as well as employees, followed a New York Times report last week that Google in 2014 gave a $90 million exit package to a senior vice president, Andy Rubin, after he was accused of sexual harassment. 
“This was the $90 million straw that broke the camel’s back,"" Celie O’Neil-Hart, one of the protest organizers and who works on YouTube marketing, told reporters as she joined hundreds of other employees in the courtyard of Google's Mountain View headquarters. ""But there are so many stories that we’ve heard for so long, and it’s time for action and change,"" said O'Neil-Hart as she teared up.
Rubin denied the allegation in the New York Times story, which he said contained ""wild exaggerations"" about his compensation. Google did not dispute the report. 
Organizers said about 60 percent of Google's offices participated, including Dublin, the company's largest site outside the United States, as well as London, Zurich, Berlin and Singapore. They shared photographs on social media of hundreds leaving offices.
Many employees at the Mountain View walkout chanted “Women’s rights are workers rights,"" and some wore blue ribbons in support of sexual harassment victims.
Seven U.S. employees who organized the demonstrations called on Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) to make harassment investigations fairer for accusers, share pay-equity data with workers and add an employee representative to its board.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, speaking an hour later at a New York Times conference in New York, said he was taking note of the ""concrete steps"" workers presented to improve the company's culture and human resources processes.
""I want to make sure Google sets the bar,"" he said, noting that a lack of gender and racial diversity was part of the issue. ""We're grappling with it, as with many places.""
Organizers and other employees said Google executives, like leaders at the dozens of companies affected by the #metoo movement, have been slow to address numerous structural issues such as unchecked power of male executives.
They want Google to publicly report its sexual harassment statistics and end forced arbitration in harassment cases. They also have asked that the chief diversity officer be able to directly advise the board.
Rana Abdelhamid, who works in Google Cloud's marketing division in San Francisco, told reporters that the walkout was ""about safety of women in the workplace,"" adding that Google's historical support for women's causes caused her to be shocked when she learned of the multi-million-dollar payout.
""The numbers and facts don't match with the intentions"" of Google on equality and safety for underrepresented groups, she told Reuters. ""We need to reprioritize energy and really focus on these issues.""
MONTHS OF BUILDUP
Since its founding two decades ago, Google has been known for its motto ""don't be evil,"" a dictum preserved in its worker code of conduct, and its transparency with employees about corporate strategy.
But employees have internally organized for months to increase diversity and improve treatment of women and minorities.
Those issues have been top of mind since the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, stunned Silicon Valley, where liberal and libertarian policies are popular. 
Tech workers have become more vocal to protest both the president's and their companies' stances on immigration, defense and discrimination. Workers have said that they are driven by the sense that their technology pioneer employers should also be standard bearers on socioeconomic issues.
""We all know that the status quo is unacceptable and if there is any company who can solve this, it is Google,” said Thomas Kneeland, a Google software engineer in New York.
The dissatisfaction among Alphabet's 94,000 employees and tens of thousands contractors has not noticeably affected the company's share price. But employees, who warned they would demonstrate again if needed, expect Alphabet to face recruiting and retention challenges if their concerns go unaddressed.
Alphabet shares closed down 0.4 percent to $1,085.98 on Thursday.
Around the world, Google workers walked out carrying signs reading ""Time's up Tech,"" ""Happy to quit for $90M - no sexual harassment required"" and ""Not OK Google,"" a reference to the ""OK Google"" phrase used to activate Google's voice-operated Assistant. 
Cathay Bi, a Google product manager, speaking through a megaphone before hundreds gathered in a bustling pedestrian plaza in San Francisco's financial district, talked about the engines of change. 

""This is what it means to be 'Googley,'"" she urged the crowd to chant, invoking a widely used term for the company's culture. ""People don't change because of law and policies. Laws and policies change because of people.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were ""moving along nicely,"" reviving hopes that the two countries can resolve their trade dispute.
Adding to the upbeat mood, the latest round of results from companies was mostly positive.
After the bell though, shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell about 7.0 percent, pushing its market capitalization below $1 trillion, after the company said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations. The stock ended the regular session up 1.5 percent. 
U.S. stock futures fell late Thursday. S&P 500 e-mini futures  were down 0.4 percent in trading for the overnight session.
During the regular session, the technology index (SPLRCT) rose 1.2 percent, continuing to recover from the recent selloff.
Earlier, Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month.
The trade-sensitive S&P industrial sector (SPLRCI) rose 1.7 percent, with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) among companies leading the gains.
""Maybe there's going to be some hope that a trade deal with China will actually come through,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
Beyond that, investors are feeling a bit more comfortable after gains this week, he said.
""Now you get a little bit of fear of missing out, mixing in with, 'I don't believe this is actually happening',"" he said. ""The fear of missing out seems to be on the winning side.""
Despite ending higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years, following fears of a widening global trade dispute, rising borrowing costs, and that U.S. earnings growth may slow more than forecast in 2019.
The S&P materials index (SPLRCM) was up 3.0 percent, with DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP) surging 8.1 percent after it reported strong results and plans for a $3 billion share buyback.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 264.98 points, or 1.06 percent, to 25,380.74, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 28.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 128.16 points, or 1.75 percent, to 7,434.06.
Also helping were robust earnings reports from three Apple suppliers,  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI), Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and  Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO).
Technology-related stocks, which have led the stock market's bull run in recent years, helped lead the selling in October, with the S&P 500 tech index down 8 percent in the month.
The Nasdaq is up 5.4 percent for the last three sessions, its biggest three-day gain since February 2016.
Of the 348 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so far, 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, pushing the aggregate third-quarter earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies to 26.2 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Friday brings the U.S. monthly jobs report for October. Investors will look for further signs of tightening labor market conditions. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 57 new lows.

About 9.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

""Because we do not have a guarantee against a work stoppage, we cannot afford to put our customers' volume at risk of being stranded in our system,"" UPS said in a statement. 
The halt in pickups for large shipments of goods bound for stores and other destinations will not affect small-package deliveries during the upcoming holiday season, UPS said.
UPS wrapped up contract discussions with the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee on Oct. 25. The union has already authorized a strike if members vote ""no"" on the final contract offer from UPS. 
On Oct. 5, UPS freight division workers rejected an earlier contract offer. An extension agreement is set to expire on Nov. 12.
A strike by the 12,000 Teamsters covered by the contract would be the first at UPS in more than two decades. 
The Teamsters represent 250,000 UPS employees. 
Freight is significantly smaller than the parcel delivery business at UPS, limiting the impact of a strike. The Atlanta-based company had third-quarter freight revenue of $867 million, compared with U.S. Ground revenue of almost $7.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>","France's Perenco, Russia's Gazprombank named in Venezuela graft case: source","By Alexandra Ulmer
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anglo-French oil company Perenco and Russian financial firm Gazprombank have been identified in testimony by a former Venezuelan state oil company official who said he received millions of dollars in bribes in return for giving them preferential treatment, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. 
Abraham Ortega, a former financial executive at state oil company PDVSA, accepted $5 million in bribes to favor a French oil company and from a Russian bank, U.S. prosecutors in Florida said on Wednesday in a statement, which did not name either company. Ortega received $3 million to help the French company and $2 million to favor the Russian one, according to the Department of Justice announcement.
Prosecutors said that in exchange, Ortega helped the companies gain ""priority status"" to loan money to oil joint ventures in which they were partners with PDVSA. 
The high-profile case is one of a slew of U.S. probes into corruption in Venezuela which is reeling from hyperinflation, empty shelves, and mass emigration, but the case is one of the first to link corruption in the oil sector to prominent foreign firms. 
Perenco, Gazprombank and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The case stemmed from cash-strapped PDVSA's chronic delays in paying dividends to foreign firms, a second source said. 
Perenco was desperate to receive those funds and get the money out of Venezuela, according to the source. Perenco agreed to loan money to the Petrowarao joint venture it ran with PDVSA, but as part of the deal had to be paid its late dividend payments beforehand. 
The company received those payments in late 2013, the source said. Former oil minister Rafael Ramirez, who is now on the run from leftist President Nicolas Maduro's government, announced in 2014 that Perenco was loaning $420 million to Petrowarao to quintuple its oil production to 24,000 barrels-per-day. 
However, the source said that Perenco ended up loaning a small fraction of the promised amount.

In total, Ortega said he accepted $17 million in bribes as part of a broad embezzlement scheme. The money was hidden in the United States, Switzerland, and the Bahamas, according to the U.S. prosecutors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the House Financial Services Committee said he is still hopeful the Senate will vote on a bill that would make it easier for companies to raise capital and go public, despite a growing likelihood the legislation will stall in the upper chamber.
In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, Texas Representative Jeb Hensarling said, without offering a date, he had ""faith"" that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would keep a promise to put the bill to a vote on the Senate floor. 
""From there, it is my hope that senators will follow suit with the House to modernize our capital markets, bring (initial public offerings) back to the U.S. and help our entrepreneurs access investors and equity capital which will bring economic growth for all Americans,"" Hensarling said.
The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, which aims to cut red tape for listed companies and make it easier for private companies to raise capital, passed the House in July with overwhelming bipartisan support.
To get the House to pass a bill easing bank rules, McConnell promised House finance chair he would put a Hensarling-sponsored capital markets bill to a vote on the Senate floor. The deal was struck in response to Hensarling's complaint the bank bill did not go far enough.
McConnell did not say, however, when he would hold the vote and so far moderate Senate Democrats, whose votes are needed to pass the package, have failed to publicly back the bill.
Time is running out for the Senate, narrowly controlled by Republicans, to hold a vote this Congress, with congressional elections on Nov. 6 and the remaining Senate floor time - known on Capitol Hill as the ""lame duck"" session - likely to be devoted primarily to confirming nominees.
U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry, the House Republican deputy whip, told Reuters on Tuesday there had so far been no progress in the Senate and he did not have ""high hopes"" that the upper chamber would pass the bill. 
On Thursday, however, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for speaker of the House Paul Ryan, rebuffed this view.
""The House passed the JOBS Act 3.0 with a huge bipartisan margin, and there’s no reason the Senate shouldn’t pass this job-creating bill in the lame duck session,"" she told Reuters.
Lobbyists closely following the discussions said they expected McConnell to bring the bill to a vote in the full Senate before the end of the Congress even if he did not have sufficient support.

A spokesman for McConnell pointed Reuters to the senator's July statement, in which he said: ""Senators will continue their ongoing bipartisan discussions as we work toward a vote in the coming months.""

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported quarterly profit and revenue that beat expectations after the bell today, but investors weren't too pleased with guidance for the fiscal first quarter.
The company said it expected revenue of $89 billion to $93 billion in fiscal first quarter, with the midpoint lower than current consensus estimates for $92.9 billion.
Gross margins came in at 38.2%, just below forecasts of 38.3%. Looking ahead, Apple saw gross margins in a range of 38% to 38.5%, shy of the Street's expectations for 38.6%.
Shipments of iPhones for the quarter were about in line with forecasts, coming in at 46.9 million.
Shares of Apple fell more than 4% in after-hours trading.
2. Payrolls Expected up 193K
It’s jobs day tomorrow and all eyes will be on the latest monthly figures.
The Labor Department will release its October employment report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) as usual.
On average, economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose 193,000 last month, up from a rise of 134,000 in September.
The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 3.7%. Average hourly earnings, a key measure of inflation pressure, are forecast to have risen 0.2% in October and be up 3.1% year over year.
There have been indications for a strong number this week, with initial jobless claims matching forecasts and ADP reporting a gain of 227,000 private sector jobs for October. But ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and the government statistics often diverge wildly.
This will be the last jobs report before the midterm elections, so tweets from President Donald Trump are likely if the numbers come in strong.
3. Alibaba Will Give a Window Into China Slowdown
If it wasn’t busy enough with the jobs report, there are plenty of market-moving names on the earnings calendar that issue results ahead of trading.
Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  leads the list. Analysts surveyed predict that Alibaba will post a profit of $1.06 per share on revenue of around $52.1 billion.
Shares of the company are down around 30% in the last five months and well off all-time highs of more than $200.
The results will have a macro element as well. Given the size of its market share in Chinese e-commerce its performance will give investors further insight into the slowdown in the Chinese economy.
Shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) jumped 6.30% today.
Major energy companies are also slated to report.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) will release its latest earnings, as will fellow Dow component  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) will also weigh in."

The company has been struggling to maintain its dominance in the United states as it wrestles with increased competition from high-end coffee shops and fast-food chains.
To battle mounting competition and streamline its operations, the world's biggest coffee chain is revamping its owned and licensed businesses, closing Teavana stores, laying off employees, and introducing newer and fresher food and drinks to its menu.
The company's sales at established U.S. cafes rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the 2.76 percent rise expected on average by analysts, according to IBES data by Refinitiv.
Quarterly same-store sales in China also rose 2 percent, reversing a decline from the third quarter and driving a 3 percent rise in global comparable store sales.
The coffee chain's business in China, its fastest-growing market in recent years, slowed significantly last quarter amid fierce competition and stricter regulations on delivery services.
Since then the company has partnered with  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to deliver its coffee in Chinese cities.
""Starbucks record Q4 performance reflected meaningful improvement in virtually every critical operating metric compared to Q3,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said.
Total net revenue rose to $6.30 billion, beating expectations of $6.27 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned 62 cents per share also beating expectations of 60 cents.
However, net income attributable to the company fell to $755.8 million from $788.5 million.

Starbucks shares were up 8.6 percent at $63.67 in after-hours trading.

(Reuters) - The  New York Times  Co (N:NYT), assailed by a U.S. president who brands it as ""failing,"" signed up more than 200,000 paying online subscribers in the third quarter, helping it top Wall Street estimates for both profit and revenue.
Online subscriptions have become central to the Times' future as revenue from print advertisements dry up and the increase was the highest since a bump at the start of last year driven by President Donald Trump's repeated mentions of the paper.
Shares in the publisher rose 8 percent after quarterly results showed digital-only subscribers rose to 3.1 million at the end of September, the result of a combination of aggressive discounting and heavy spending on marketing.
The company's stock has now risen 54 percent this year.
The paper has faced repeated criticism from Trump on its coverage of the administration. The president attacked the paper several times with tweets, saying the paper was ""failing"".
When asked about the president's comments, Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson told Reuters that the White House receives many copies of the paper and said they were very loyal, long serving subscribers.
""And we always admire and thank our subscribers,"" Thompson said.
In an earlier conference call, Thompson said digital growth in the quarter was charged by a gripping news environment with events that played to the paper's strengths - like the Kavanaugh hearings. 
""There is no doubt that the heavy Washington D.C. news cycle and NYT's record of breaking news in that area is attracting new subscribers,"" said Douglas Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.
Arthur also said the paper is successfully making the transition to a digital platform from a print-based model.
The paper has continued to discount heavily while marketing itself as a source of unbiased reporting in a deeply divided America. Some digital subscriptions begin at just $1 a week.
""The first, and probably most significant driver, was the $1 a week introductory offer domestically, which ran I think the last 6 weeks to the quarter,"" Chief Operating Officer Meredith Levien said on a conference call with analysts.
The company's digital advertising revenue, now responsible for over 70 percent of overall advertising revenue, jumped about 17 percent to $57.8 million in the third quarter, while print advertising revenue continued to decline.
The newspaper's net income fell 22.7 percent to $25 million, as total expenses climbed 8.4 percent, led by higher marketing costs.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 15 cents per share from continuing operations, while total revenue rose 8.2 percent to $417.3 million.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of 11 cents per share and $408.5 million in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

CBS, home to popular shows such as the ""Big Bang Theory,"" and ""NCIS"", said advertising revenue during the reported quarter rose 14.2 percent to $1.26 billion.
The New York-based company's results come at time when it has lost Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves amid allegations of sexual assault and harassment with former Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello being named interim CEO.
CBS has hired two law firms, Covington & Burling and Debevoise & Plimpton, to investigate the claims. The investigation is ongoing.
However, CBS said affiliate and subscription fees revenue — which includes revenue from cable and satellite TV operators and online streaming providers, including its own All Access offering — fell 12 percent to $1.01 billion.
Net income from continuing operations rose to $488 million, or $1.29 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $418 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.24 per share. Total revenue rose 3 percent to $3.26 billion.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 04:04PM ET</span>","U.S. charges financier, former Goldman bankers for 1MDB","By Brendan Pierson and A. Ananthalakshmi
NEW YORK/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges on Thursday against two former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho tied to the alleged theft of billions from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn announced that Tim Leissner, former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.
Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities and is expected to be extradited, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecution.
The third person, the financier popularly known as Jho Low, remains at large. Malaysian authorities have revoked his passport and issued an arrest warrant for him, and have also applied for an Interpol red notice seeking assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, China and Hong Kong.
James Haggerty, a spokesman for Low, said in an e-mailed statement that Low ""maintains his innocence.""
""Mr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him,"" Haggerty said.
A lawyer for Leissner could not immediately be reached for comment. It was not immediately clear who is representing Ng.
Goldman has placed its former co-head of Asia investment banking, Andrea Vella, on leave over his role in the firm's involvement with the case, pending a review of allegations, according to a person familiar with the decision.
The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009. An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.
Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with alleged graft involving 1MDB.
According to the indictment against him, Low never held a formal position with the fund but he worked as an intermediary in numerous 1MDB transactions involving Goldman and others. 
Prosecutors say Low, Ng, and Leissner conspired to launder the proceeds of fraud involving 1MDB through the U.S. financial system. Some of the laundered funds were then allegedly used to pay bribes to obtain business for Goldman. Other funds were used for the personal benefit of defendants, including purchases of luxury U.S. real estate and art.
Goldman said in an emailed statement that it ""continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter."" It has previously denied any wrongdoing. 
According to prosecutors, the investment bank generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.
While U.S. prosecutors have previously filed civil asset forfeiture suits for assets allegedly bought with some of the stolen funds, these are the first criminal charges the Justice Department has brought against individuals in the case under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law targeting official bribery abroad.
At least six countries, including Malaysia, the United States and Switzerland, have been investigating alleged thefts from 1MDB.
The 1MDB investigations in the United States and Malaysia have gathered pace since Najib unexpectedly lost a general election in May to Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to power 15 years after he retired as prime minister. 
Since the election, Malaysian authorities have brought 38 charges against Najib. Many of the charges – multiple counts of corruption, money laundering and criminal breach of trust – are linked to 1MDB.

Najib has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said Thursday it is still an ""open question"" whether the company will buy back the regional sports networks it sold to entertainment company Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co in July as part of a $71 billion deal.
Speaking at the New York Times Co's DealBook conference in New York, Murdoch, who will become CEO of the remaining company ""New Fox,"" said the company ""will be inquisitive"" in looking at the possibility of buying back the sports assets. 
Disney won a bidding war earlier this year against cable company Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to acquire Fox's film and TV assets. But the U.S. Justice Department has said Disney, which owns cable sports network ESPN, must divest Fox's 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets. 
Murdoch said New Fox, which will include the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network, will be strong in live programming, but viewership for live entertainment programs specifically is declining in the industry. Live sports can help support live entertainment programming, he added.
Murdoch also said U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) had called Fox 18 months ago to discuss a possible acquisition, but said the company felt the assets would not be the right fit with Verizon.

A Verizon spokesman declined to comment.

669,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Doubting the Fed’s Resolve Is a Losing Proposition,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been a tough few weeks on Wall Street. Equity markets have struggled, with the S&P 500 Index down almost 10 percent from its Sept. 20 record high before finally finding what may be a floor. As is always the case when stocks struggle, market participants start to doubt the Federal Reserve’s resolve. Don’t.
While the turmoil has triggered a small reduction in the market’s pricing of Fed interest-rate increases going forward, the tumble in stocks falls short of that necessary to dissuade the central bank from continuing its path of gradual hikes. Barring a more significant disruption in financial markets, the Fed will resist sending dovish signals as long as labor market strength looks likely to continue. Incoming data suggests this continues to be the case.
Falling stocks, rising rates and a strengthening dollar are all signs that the Fed’s plan to tighten financial conditions is working. Even so, financial conditions remain loose relative to crisis level standards, and loose even relative to the 2015-16 disruption that stayed the Fed’s hand. Then, corporate debt yields rose dramatically relative to U.S. Treasuries. Recent moves are minor in comparison.
Then, oil prices were collapsing. Now, oil has been in an extended uptrend.
Then, the dollar surged. Now, the dollar’s rise is much more moderate.
Then, inflation expectations were falling. Now, they are stable.
In short, a look beyond the equities markets does not reveal a widespread pattern of financial tightness that one would normally associate with an economic disruption or recession. Moreover, central bankers are probably happy to see some steam come out of the stock market. The key to a sustained expansion is avoiding the buildup of imbalances such as asset bubbles that would threaten economic stability.
While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policy makers want to avoid sending signals that breed excessive pessimism in financial markets, they also want to avoid excessive optimism. Switching to a dovish stance in the wake of every correction in the stock market would favor the latter. And most importantly, incoming data do not point to a shift in the economy that would be inconsistent with the Fed’s forecast that tight labor market conditions will persist for a considerable period of time.
Gross domestic product grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter, supported by a 4 percent pace of consumer spending. Consider this number in light of the Fed’s median estimate of longer-run growth of 1.8 percent. This means that the economy operates at a pace likely to put further downward pressure on unemployment, and will continue to do so even if economic activity slows as anticipated in 2019. Labor market tightness won’t dissipate quickly, so don’t count on a slowing economy alone to persuade Powell to pull his foot off the brakes.
Moreover, recent wage data will only reinforce the Fed’s suspicions that the economy currently operates above full employment. While not yet excessive, wage growth is clearly climbing higher. The Employment Cost Index report for the third quarter released Wednesday confirmed that trend.
Despite persistently tight labor markets, inflation has yet to take off and instead sits comfortably at the Fed’s target. From the Fed’s view, this is not reason to change the policy path. Policy makers will tend to view tame inflation not as a reason to stop boosting rates, but as a reason not to accelerate the pace of rate hikes. Central bankers might argue that past rate increases are the reason the inflation rate isn’t higher.
Remember, Fed policy has always been about preemptive rate hikes to stave off inflationary pressures or financial imbalances. If successfully executed, neither should emerge to a degree that threatens the expansion. From the Fed’s point of view, so far, so good.
Altogether, this means that market participants should keep their eyes on the interplay between incoming data and the Fed’s forecasts. The Fed will most likely continue to raise rates until central bankers become confident that they have tightened the screws enough to slow activity to what they view is a more sustainable pace. Even after the equity market tumble, we aren’t yet at that point."

675,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Rising interest rates pinch U.S. auto sales, consumer confidence","By Rachit Vats and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose slightly in October, hit by rising interest rates and higher vehicle prices, and No.2 carmaker  Ford Motor Co . (N:F) warned of slipping consumer confidence, indicating sales volumes would continue to moderate in 2018.
Ford on Thursday reported a 5 percent decline in sales for its pickup trucks, while overall sales fell 3.9 percent to 192,616 units in October hurt by lower passenger car demand.
Ford said consumers are relatively confident about economic conditions, albeit slightly less so than in September, citing data for October from University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, adding payments have crept up with rising interests rates.
The number of respondents in the index saying that it was a good time to buy a car fell 8 points from September to 59 percent on higher concerns about vehicle prices and interest rates, Ford added.
""Interest rates are taking payments up along with our transaction pricing. So little bit of pressure there,"" said Mark LaNeve, vice president, U.S. marketing, sales and service at Ford.
Ford's transaction prices increased by $1,400 in October from a year ago, compared with $330 for the overall industry.
The carmaker said its gross stock increased to 87 days from 79 a year ago, as its dealers anticipated more vehicle demand in November and December. The industry sees 60-65 days inventory as healthy.
U.S. car sales, which dropped 2 percent last year from a record high of 17.55 million in 2016, are expected to fall further in 2018, hurt by rising interest rates and the return of more late-model used cars to dealer lots.
But automakers have been helped as more U.S. consumers shift away from traditional passenger cars to larger SUVs and trucks, which tend to be more profitable for producers.
Smaller rival  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said U.S. sales rose 16 percent on higher demand for its Jeep and Ram vehicles..
SUVs have also been a bright spot for Ford, contributing about 35 percent of its total U.S. sales volumes in October, up from 31.6 percent a year ago.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) separately said its U.S. sales rose about 1.4 percent to 191,102 units, due to increased demand for Highlander and Tacoma SUVs. (https://toyota.us/2PBBg2S)
Honda Motor Co Ltd's (T:7267) U.S. sales fell 4 percent to 122,182 vehicles, on weaker demand for passenger cars while its smaller rival Nissan Group's sales fell 10.6 percent to 109,962 vehicles.

Earlier this year, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) switched to reporting sales quarterly instead of monthly.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) will expand training for staff investigating sexual misconduct claims, and introduce a confidential hotline to handle such allegations, an internal memo sent to staff seen by Reuters shows.
The changes follow a review conducted by law firm Freshfields into how UBS handled a former junior trader's initial allegation that she was raped in September 2017 by a senior colleague.
The memo, signed by three senior UBS executives, said the Freshfields review had found the bank had not made any major errors in its handling of the complaint.
""The independent review concluded that having considered all of the available evidence, there were no fundamental errors in the investigation process and that the investigation team sought to conduct the investigation fairly,"" it said.
A spokeswoman for UBS confirmed the contents of the memo and declined to comment further, while a spokeswoman for Freshfields declined to comment.
The former UBS employee who made the sexual assault allegation told Reuters she had no immediate comment.
The review did highlight ""some areas for improvement and recommendations,"" to support the bank's zero tolerance policy on sexual misconduct, the UBS memo said.
As a result, UBS will introduce measures including the expanded training and a dedicated complaints hotline.

Icahn, who owns 9.3 percent of Dell, called the proposed deal a ""conflicted transaction that benefits the controlling stockholders, at the expense of the DVMT stockholders"".
Dell said in July it would pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back shares tied to its interest in software company VMware Inc (N:VMW), returning it to the stock market without an initial public offering.
Icahn and other hedge fund investors have resisted the plan, saying the proposed deal massively undervalues the tracking stock.
""We believe this is a threat blatantly deployed in an attempt to coerce DVMT stockholders to vote in favor of the merger, or else risk the unknown consequences of the forced IPO conversion,"" Icahn said on Thursday.
Dell will hold a shareholder meeting on Dec. 11 to vote on the deal.
A Dell spokesman said Icahn's allegations were ""unfounded"", adding that the company would file a response later in the day.
Icahn is no stranger to lawsuits. He sued  AmTrust Financial  Services (O:AFSI) earlier this year over its go-private plans.
The investor also turned legal arguments against Dell in the past, having alleged that Michael Dell and Silver Lake undervalued the company's go-private deal several years ago.
Icahn, along with investor Darwin Deason, also urged  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) shareholders earlier this year to oppose a sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901).

695,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mastercard lodged U.S. protest over Modi's promotion of Indian card network,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mastercard (N:MA) told the United States government in June that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was using nationalism to promote the use of a domestic payments network, and New Delhi's protectionist policies were hurting foreign payment companies, a document seen by Reuters showed.
Modi has in recent years backed India's homegrown payments network ""RuPay"", whose rise has broken the dominance of U.S. payment giants such as Mastercard and Visa (N:V). More than half of India's 1 billion debit and credit cards now go through the RuPay payment system, and that means companies such as Mastercard face an uphill task to expand rapidly in one of the world's biggest payments growth markets.
Modi has publicly endorsed the indigenous card payment network, saying using RuPay was like serving the country as its transaction fee stays within India and could help build roads, schools and hospitals.
In a written reference to Modi's stance, Mastercard told the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on June 21 that the prime minister ""associated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism, claiming it serves as 'kind of national service'."" 
The note, which was sent by a Mastercard Vice President for Global Public Policy, Sahra English, said that, while Modi's digital payments push was ""commendable"", the Indian government had adopted ""a series of protectionist measures"" to the detriment of global companies. 
U.S. companies in India have been increasingly battling Modi's policies they perceive to be protectionist. This year, U.S. technology companies have protested against an Indian law that would require them to store more data locally, raising their costs.
The previously unreported note, which was seen by Reuters, shows the extent to which Modi's support for RuPay frustrated the Purchase, New York-based company, which is the world's second-largest payments processor.
""Increasing rhetoric from the prime minister and government mandates on promotion and preference for RuPay ... continues to create market access issues for U.S. payments technology companies,"" Mastercard said in the note.
""The Indian government's preferential treatment of RuPay coupled with fallacies on pricing must be discontinued,"" the company asked the U.S. government to propose.
In response to Reuters queries, Mastercard said in a statement it ""fully supports"" the Indian government's initiatives and is ""deeply invested"" in the country. The company did not comment on its USTR note and its executive Sahra English did not respond to questions.
The USTR did not respond to a request for comment and it was not clear whether the U.S. agency raised Mastercard's concerns with New Delhi. Visa did not respond to Reuters queries.
There was no response to requests for comment from Modi's office.
Mastercard, whose president and chief executive is India-born Ajay Banga, has a planned investment outlay of $1 billion in its key Indian market for 2014-2019. With 2,000 people, India accounts for 14 percent of the global Mastercard workforce, the largest outside the United States.
The company recruited a Bollywood actor this year for a campaign aimed at encouraging consumers in smaller cities to use debit cards more regularly as it seeks to grow in India.
DIGITAL BOOST
In November 2016, Modi started promoting the use of digital payments after replacing high-value currency notes in an attempt to crack down on the black economy. 
That increased card usage: Indians in August clocked transactions worth $51 billion on debit and credit cards, nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016, according to data from the central bank, which does not provide separate usage statistics comparing Indian and foreign payment networks.
Foreign card companies have also had to contend with a growing use of mobile wallets and state-backed digital money transfer services, some of which Modi promoted. 
RuPay received a major boost due to Modi's so-called financial inclusion program launched in 2014, which meant that all Indians opening a bank account for the first time were offered a RuPay card, not a Mastercard or Visa.
The Indian card network was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a group largely owned by state banks but which also counts private and foreign banks among its shareholders. It also oversees the payments services in India.
In its note to the USTR, Mastercard said the government had mandated banks to support the NPCI directly and indirectly, making it the ""sole beneficiary"" of Modi's financial inclusion program.
The NPCI acted both as ""a quasi-regulator and a competing payment network"", Mastercard said, adding that this was ""compounded by the government's open preference for RuPay with misleading statements and inaccurate information on pricing, despite Mastercard being priced lower than RuPay"". 
Pricing refers to the fee paid by banks to payment processors such as Mastercard for card transactions. The company did not detail which specific statements it was referring to. 
The chief executive of the NPCI, Dilip Asbe, did not respond to a request for comment.
At one point, RuPay levied a transaction fee which was half of that charged by Mastercard and Visa, one industry source said, but the U.S. card companies reduced charges in recent months. The pricing and charges are not publicly available.
Modi in June said foreign card companies take their transaction fees abroad and as ""everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country, we can use RuPay card to serve the nation"".

A month later, Mastercard issued a press statement which said the company gets only 15-20 percent of debit card transaction fees, while the rest stays ""within the Indian economy"". It did not name RuPay.

LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spotify (N:SPOT) sent its shares tumbling as much as 10 percent on Thursday after the world's most popular paid music streaming service said it would continue to sacrifice profit margins to generate future growth.
The Swedish company came close to making its first-ever operating profit in the third quarter, years ahead of schedule, which the company said was because it had not been spending heavily enough to hire more engineers.
""Operating margin improvement in Q3 was largely due to shortfalls in hiring,"" the company said in a statement, adding that its failure to spend more on hiring was continuing in the fourth quarter.
Spotify pledged to accelerate the pace of investments in research and development in new music services and additional content during 2019, which the company said would reduce its operating margins ""for the foreseeable future.""
Hit by the global tech stock sell-off over the past month, Spotify's shares have given up their 30 percent gain since their stock market debut in April on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The shares dropped to $137.73 in early trading following the third-quarter report, which showed gains in paid subscribers, revenue and gross margins that were roughly in line with market expectations. The stock closed at $149 on its first trading day.
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst George Salmon said the performance was much better than forecast. 
""However, much of this improvement is due to costs not increasing as fast as expected, due to shortfalls in hiring,"" he said, noting that these issues have continued in fourth quarter.
Third-quarter operating margin shrank to a negative 0.5 percent from negative 7.1 percent in recent quarters. Spotify reported an operating loss of 6 million euros after previously guiding investors to expect losses between 10-90 million euros.
""Unfortunately profitability is no good (and) that's too bad,"" Tomas Otterbeck, an analyst with research firm Redeye in Stockholm, said, referring to the company's determination to prioritize revenue growth over profitability for years to come.
The company tightened its expectations for full-year 2018 monthly active listeners to between 199 million to 206 million users. Analysts, on average, had been predicting 208 million users by the end of the year.
Monthly subscribers, which deliver 90 percent of revenue, rose to 87 million, up from 83 million in the second quarter ending June, it said. The latest results matched the average forecast in a Thomson Reuters analyst poll.
Total users rose to 191 million, including free, advertising-supported listeners.
BALANCING ACT 
Spotify is seeking to develop a ""two-sided marketplace"" that connects both artists and recording industry labels to consumers but in non-traditional ways, using data on listener behavior to generate popular playlists that drive revenue to rights holders.
During the third quarter, Spotify expanded its direct licensing of musicians and their recordings, which it says about 250,000 artists have signed up for so far. 
But Spotify still relies on striking licensing agreements with major record labels, which account for the vast majority of music streams on its service. The company is entering into re-negotiations with the labels during 2019.
""We've made it clear that our strategy is not to become a label, and not to compete with labels,"" Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy told reporters on a conference call. 
""(Spotify and the labels) have developed a mutual dependency on each other. It's in both our economic interest to achieve a constructive outcome,"" he said.
McCarthy said he aimed to convince music labels that Spotify remained a music industry ally and that its efforts to support independent artists and other distribution partners would expand the market for all major parties. 
In the previous round of music licensing negotiations, record labels increased Spotify's share of royalties to around 25 percent of revenues from around 15 percent.
McCarthy declined to comment when asked if the label renegotiations would potentially mean improved margins for Spotify.
Gross margins rose to 25.3 percent from 22.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Analysts were looking for margins around 24.9 percent, according to the Thomson Reuters poll.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - An activist hedge fund led by the former finance chief of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) has taken a 3.1 percent stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), saying it backed new CEO Christian Sewing's efforts to turn around Germany's biggest bank, but there was more to do.
The move by New York-based Hudson Executive Capital LP, led by Douglas Braunstein, makes the hedge fund one of Deutsche Bank's biggest investors and boosted its shares on Thursday. 
After three years of losses, a failed regulatory test, several attempts to restructure, a leadership shake-up and a ratings downgrade, many investors have lost faith in Germany's flagship bank. Its shares have fallen 44 percent this year.
Hudson ""sees significant long-term value in Deutsche Bank"", it said in a statement. 
""Recent actions, including changes in management and headcount reductions, demonstrate the resolve of the new management team to deliver on promises made to investors,"" it added.
However, it also said there was ""still significant room"" for the bank to use its funds more efficiently to improve returns. 
""Unfortunately, historical missteps have clouded the issues for many investors today and has led to sentiment uniquely bearish to Deutsche Bank,"" Hudson said. ""We believe we can now shine light on this opportunity.""
Sewing, who took the helm in a sudden management change in April, welcomed the investment.
""Doug Braunstein and Hudson Executive come with deep backgrounds investing in financial services companies,"" he said in a statement. ""We appreciate Hudson Executive's confidence in our ability to execute on our strategic objectives.""
Braunstein said in an interview that Sewing's promotion to CEO was the catalyst for his investment. Before, there was no clear strategy and dysfunction, he said.
""People say in the company that he has made more decisions in three months than the company made in the previous three years,"" Braunstein said of Sewing.
He said he wasn't seeking a seat on the bank's supervisory board. Instead, the most valuable role he can play is to encourage other institutional investors to invest in Deutsche, he said.
""They have to get on the bandwagon,"" he said.
Deutsche Bank's shares were up 3.1 percent to 8.92 euros at 1409 GMT in Frankfurt, outperforming Germany's DAX index (GDAXI) of blue-chip stocks.
In its statement, Hudson largely endorsed Deutsche Bank's current strategy of job cuts in investment banking, as well as a focus on retail banking, transaction banking and asset management. 

Other major shareholders in Deutsche Bank include the royal family of Qatar, Chinese conglomerate HNA, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), and U.S. buyout fund Cerberus.

The key trading unit -- whose struggles have been one of the most difficult challenges in Thiam’s three-year tenure -- posted an unexpected loss in the third quarter, forcing the bank to abandon its $6 billion revenue target this year for the business. The result added to investor disappointment over missed revenue and net income.
Thiam has promised to return half the bank’s profit, mainly through buybacks or special dividends, once the lender strengthens capital generation from next year. Scaling down Global Markets -- once one of the strongest trading units on Wall Street -- and restoring profitability has been a key project of Thiam’s. The loss is likely to add to fresh questions about future strategy for the unit.
‘Uninspiring’
“Credit Suisse results are uninspiring, worse compared to peers,” Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti wrote in a note to investors. “Global Markets disappoints again and keeps underperforming its peers.”
The shares dropped as much as 4.7 percent in Zurich and traded 1.6 percent lower at 13.02 francs as of 2:30 p.m. local time and are down by about a quarter this year.
Since Thiam joined from insurer  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc, he’s exited multiple business lines in global markets, from distressed-debt trading to securitized product trading in Europe. He’s not giving up on the unit, though. The bank plans to invest about 250 million francs in the business after reducing some funding costs, Thiam said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, while acknowledging some targets had been too ambitious.
Thiam Grilled
“Let’s talk about the future of global markets,” Thiam said in a call with analysts who grilled the executive over the unit’s performance. “We expect that revenues will benefit from the investments we have made in equities,” he said.
Credit Suisse has focused on boosting the wealth management business and dealing with legacy issues, including a settlement with the Department of Justice over the sale of faulty securities, and the buyback of expensive capital instruments from key shareholders. Thiam, though, still needs to reassure investors on how the bank will boost growth.
There was some good news: the bank’s CET1 ratio -- a key measure of financial strength -- increased about 10 basis points from the end of the second quarter, while the bank continues to attract inflows at a healthy clip in its wealth management and asset management businesses, adding about 14.8 billion francs of new assets in total. The bank also said it expects to meet a target cost base of less than 17 billion francs by the end of the year.
Refocusing Bank
Credit Suisse is freeing up funds for investment after buying back about 5.9 billion francs ($6 billion) of debt issued after the financial crisis to cut funding costs. Thiam is refocusing the bank as new regulations after the financial crisis -- including higher capital requirements -- forced it to abandon the investment bank-led strategy.
Thiam’s bet on managing money for the very wealthy is focused on emerging markets and entrepreneurs. Credit Suisse set a regional structure for the private-banking businesses and regionalized further this year to be closer to clients in the regions and seek to give more authority to local management teams. A further bright spot was the bank’s Asia division.
Net new money from Asian private banking clients of 6.4 billion francs increased 12.5 percent at an annualized rate - one sign Thiam’s move to target the region’s wealthy is paying off. That was faster than UBS, Asia’s biggest wealth manager, which has almost double the number of relationship managers in the region.
International Wealth Management -- which saw profit rise by 50 percent between 2015 and 2017 -- posted a growth rate of 3.2 percent in net new money for the quarter while profits were in line with expectations.

704,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 09:28AM ET</span>",It looks like the worst of the market meltdown is over — but Goldman Sachs says there's still one big fear troubling investors,"To the casual observer, the stock market meltdown that plunged US indexes into a correction appears to be over.
Equities sharply rebounded over the past two days, and investor nerves seem to have calmed considerably. There may be some lingering aftershocks, but it seems as if much of Wall Street thinks the worst of the turmoil is behind us.
But Goldman Sachs says not so fast. While the market may seem to have stabilized at the broader index level, there's still plenty of trepidation lurking under the surface on a single-stock basis.
The firm is focused on a measure called put-call skew, which measures hedging levels. A higher reading means investors are protecting more to the downside, implying nervousness.
As you can see in the chart below, skew for the average stock has actually spiked since the start of October. Meanwhile, the same measure for the entire S&P 500 has declined sharply amid the selling that engulfed the market for most of the month.
""Such a large divergence between these two measures is unusual,"" a group of strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a client note. ""This suggests investors fear gap-moves lower in single stocks over the next three months.""
It's not a coincidence that this divergence is occurring during the thick of corporate earnings season. Stocks have been swinging more than usual on quarterly reports, and investors have taken notice.
Goldman finds that the average earnings-related stock move for S&P 500 companies has been 4.5%, the highest since the third quarter of 2009 — or the period immediately after the financial crisis.
And it doesn't help that those earnings-driven single-stock fluctuations have been largely occurring in a downward direction. That's because the bar has been raised for companies as a whole, and simply matching analyst expectations isn't enough anymore.
In fact, even firms that have beaten forecasts have felt the wrath of skeptical traders. Data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) finds that investors aren't rewarding companies that beat profit and sales expectations for the first time since the tech bubble burst in 2000. And that, in turn, can be viewed as a late-cycle signal."

706,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. online spending set to rise 14.8 percent in 2018 holiday season,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. online spending during the holiday shopping season is likely to grow 14.8 percent this year to $124.1 billion, far outpacing the 2.7 percent growth predicted for brick-and-mortar locations and highlighting the ongoing switch from stores to web shopping.
The forecast was released on Thursday by Adobe Analytics, the web analytics arm of Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc. The company measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers and trillions of customer visits to U.S. retail sites.
Online sales this year will benefit from an extra day between Cyber Monday to Christmas, which is likely to provide a $284 million sales boost, the report said.
Adobe also forecast the best days for shopping online based on prices across product categories during previous years. For example, Thanksgiving is likely to be a good day to buy sporting goods as prices could be 13 percent lower than their average in the first 10 months of the year. Black Friday will still be a good option for television purchases as prices could be about 22 percent lower.
Apparel discounts could make items cheaper by 22 percent than average on Nov. 25, and toys are likely to be 19 percent cheaper on Cyber Monday, the report said.
The November and December holiday shopping season are critical for retailers, when they book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits.
Overall U.S. holiday sales including stores and online in 2018 will increase by 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent from a year ago, when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to The National Retail Federation.
The trade body said holiday sales growth will be higher than an average increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years but slower than last year's 5.3 percent gain, when consumer spending grew the most since 2005, boosted by tax cuts.

715,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Danske Ready for `Large' Fine as Bank Fights to Win Back Trust,"(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S is pulling out all the stops to win back trust and protect its business after finding itself embroiled in one of Europe’s worst ever money laundering scandals.
Denmark’s biggest bank used Thursday to assure investors it has the financial strength to absorb “large” fines as it awaits the outcome of multiple criminal investigations. Danske also revealed a long list of measures designed to fight financial crime, in an effort to stop clients fleeing the bank in anger, and even said it will reconsider its bonus arrangements.
Investors welcomed the update, and shares in Danske gained as much as 6.5 percent in Copenhagen, marking the bank’s best performance since February 2016.
Back in September, Danske shocked its investors and clients when it admitted that much of about $230 billion that flowed through a tiny Estonian unit might need to be treated as suspicious in origin. Management is in an ongoing dialogue with authorities in the U.S., Denmark and Estonia in connection with criminal investigations into the case.
Interim Chief Executive Officer Jesper Nielsen described the “huge task” now facing the bank as it tries to rebuild its position in the Nordic region.
Danske’s third-quarter results, which fell short of analyst expectations, were overshadowed by its update on the money laundering scandal. Nielsen said it’s still too early to say how big a fine it may be facing. Analysts have published estimates as high as about $8 billion, while the bank’s market value has slumped about $16.5 billion this year.
Danske has already made a “donation” to society of 1.5 billion kroner ($230 million) based on gross income at the Tallinn-based unit at the heart of the scandal. It’s also been forced to add 10 billion kroner to its regulatory capital in connection with the case, prompting management to cancel this year’s share buyback program.
Nielsen said Danske has been “very prudent in terms of capital and can basically withstand large fines or sanctions.” He said the financial impact of the scandal has been “limited so far,” and that the bank is doing what it can to fight the threat of a customer exodus.
He also said the bank is reviewing its approach toward bonuses.
“I think, though, that there is another thing we need to think about and that is we have a lot of people working very hard to minimize the damage,” he said in a phone interview on Thursday.
“So we’ll take the results and the efforts into consideration when we look at bonuses,” Nielsen said. “So that will be a combination of factors determining that.”
Danske CEO Speaks to Bloomberg
The interim CEO said Danske is investing “massively” to “combat financial crime,” in an interview with Bloomberg Television. It’s also taking a very different approach to capital management, as it awaits news of a potential fine. “We are more preoccupied with being seen as prudent in terms of capital these days than necessarily handing back capital to shareholders,” he said.
Nielsen became CEO in October, when Danske removed Thomas Borgen for his role in the laundering scandal. Nielsen has ruled himself out as a candidate for the job in the long term. Danske tried to win regulatory approval for its head of wealth management, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, to become CEO, but failed. It didn’t provide any further updates on Thursday.
According to the bank’s updated factbook, it lost about 8,000 customers in Denmark last quarter, as Danes learned the full scope of the laundering scandal.
Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet, said “one could have feared a bigger exodus.” But he also notes that there’s an expectation that customer flight will continue in coming quarters, though it appears “Danske Bank will stand its course.”
Nielsen said Danske is working hard to “explain to the market” how much it’s done to avoid ever again being dragged into a similar scandal. That includes building up a staff of about 1,200 people to focus on compliance in the area, compared with roughly 300 in 2015, he said.
“It is important that people can feel that we are truly sorry and that we take this very seriously,” he said.
Danske reported profit that fell short of analyst expectations last quarter. Net income in the three months through September came in at 2.28 billion kroner, about 4 percent below consensus estimates. Nielsen said income “was affected by the uncertainty in the financial markets.”
The bank still expects to generate profit somewhere between 16 billion kroner and 17 billion kroner this year.

VW has already had to pay compensation over the emissions scandal in the United States to car owners. But in Germany, VW was able to strike a deal with regulators to fix emissions with a software update, allowing its cars to retain their road-worthiness certification.
The class action lawsuit seeks to ascertain whether owners of cars with type EA 189 diesel engines had been intentionally harmed by the carmaker's use of engine management software designed to disguise excessive pollution levels.
Volkswagen said on Thursday the possibility of class action suits did not change its standpoint that there was no legal basis for consumers to make claims in connection to the diesel issue in Germany.
Around 40,000 consumers have expressed interest in joining the lawsuit before a statute of limitations on claiming damages expires this year, vzbv said.
Owners of VWs with diesel engines have seen the value of their cars tumble after regulators found they produced excessive levels of pollution. Regulators have even sought to ban diesel cars from inner cities, further denting residual values.
In response to the so-called dieselgate scandal, lawmakers amended class action rules in Germany, making it easier for individuals to join group lawsuits without having to file a new case.
Whether consumers are entitled to damages and what form these damages may take, will need to be established in a separate lawsuit.
Vzbv has said it wanted to get compensation for some 2 million owners of diesel cars that were not as environmentally friendly as VW said they were at the time of purchase.
VW admitted in 2015 it had used illegal engine control devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.

718,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Shell Churns Out Cash Like Oil's Above $100 Again,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil is trading well below its price of a decade ago, but you’d have no idea looking at Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc’s giant pile of cash.
The Anglo-Dutch oil major generated the most cash from operations in 10 years last quarter -- almost $15 billion. The last time Shell pumped out that much money was the year crude soared to $140 a barrel, compared with about $75 today.
As a result, the company is showing greater confidence. It increased the pace of a $25 billion buyback program, rewarding shareholders who stuck with it through crude’s collapse. The cash surge is a feather in the cap of Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden, who splashed more than $50 billion on buying BG Group Plc in 2016 during the depths of the downturn.
Yet investors, who have been impatient for greater returns, didn’t react positively to the results, which were largely as expected. Shell’s B shares dropped as much as 2.7 percent in early trading as sliding oil prices also dragged down peers.
“Truly, the amount of cash this company is generating is impressive and requires an exceptional strategy,” Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said on a call with reporters. “I think there was perhaps a lack of understanding of our ability to achieve this cash flow.”
The $14.7 billion cash figure excludes working capital movements of $2.6 billion, the difference between assets and liabilities. Uhl attributed the figure to having to build up oil inventories in its refineries and gas in preparation for the high demand winter season. Even with that number subtracted from the total, Shell is still generating cash as if oil were well over $100 a barrel.
The cash boom can largely be attributed to the company’s broad portfolio, with higher prices for liquefied natural gas and a greater contribution from trading adding to earnings in the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, some of its most profitable barrels came online, helping drive the result. Additionally, after the BG acquisition Shell shed about $30 billion of aging or costly assets to reduce debt.
Uhl basically expects these sorts of cash figures to stay. The company said it will generate between $25 billion and $30 billion of free cash flow every year through 2020. That’s compared to $8 billion for the third quarter of this year, up from $3.7 billion a year-earlier. She’s also made clear how it plans to spend it. Shell will focus on completing its buyback program and reducing debt.
Raising Returns
Return on average capital employed jumped to 7.1 percent in the quarter from 4.6 percent a year earlier. Van Beurden has made lifting returns above 10 percent one of his principal goals.

Buranasiri, chief executive of the Thai arm of AirAsia X since 2014, will replace co-CEOs and co-founders Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun with immediate effect, the company said in a statement.
Fernandes and Kamarudin will become non-executive directors.
In July, Fernandes said AirAsia X was looking to restructure itself into a group holding company along the lines of affiliate AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA).
He had also said AirAsia X would focus on flying to countries where it would dominate routes, such as Japan, Korea, Australia, China and India, and remove what he called peripheral routes where no growth was seen.
AirAsia X reported a loss for the June quarter, weighed down by higher fuel prices.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",What the looming bear market might look like: McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - Let's assume the correction currently underway on Wall Street turns into an outright bear market, and the main U.S. equity indices rack up peak-to-trough losses of at least 20 percent. What kind of bear market can we expect?
All bear markets are different, but they are less frequent than bull markets and, on average, much shorter. They can also be extremely damaging. 
The stock market is not the economy and the economy is not the stock market, but every U.S. recession over the last half century has been accompanied by major lurches lower on Wall Street. Will history repeat itself next year or 2020? 
GRAPHIC: Wall Street bear markets - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P3x7oT
Since 1900, the S&P 500 has undergone 32 bear markets, which means statistically they occur roughly once every three and a half years, according to independent financial advisor Dana Anspach. 
Analysts at First Trust Portfolios calculate that since 1926 the average bear market period has lasted 1.4 years, with an average cumulative loss of 41 percent. 
Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group, meanwhile, have looked at the data since 1927 and reckon the average bear market is shorter, at 296 calendar days.
The last two bear markets on Wall Street in 2000-02 and 2007-09 saw the S&P 500 decline 45 and 50 percent, respectively. That helped pull the MSCI World index down 50 and 60 percent, respectively.
The correction underway on Wall Street has seen the S&P 500 fall 11.5 percent from its peak a month ago, while the MSCI World has fallen as much as 15 percent from its peak in January, also in part driven by major weakness in emerging markets. China, for example, is down 30 percent from its January peak.
But as long as the U.S. selloff is just a correction, the multi-year bull run remains the second-longest in history, even if it is losing steam. There are compelling reasons to believe it will roll over into a bear market, but getting the timing right is tricky. 
Bull markets run much longer than bear markets as populations and economies expand. More people means more savings that need to be invested, and as equity historically has offered higher returns than bonds, stock markets attract more of those funds and rise over time.
The average bull run since 1927 is close to 1,000 days, according to Bespoke Investments. The longest in history is the late 1987-early 2000 run of 4,494 days. That will be broken if the current run, already over 3,000 days, extends until June 29, 2021.
The following chart from FT Portfolios shows that the average bull market since 1927 has lasted 9.1 years, with an average cumulative total return of 480 percent. The current bull market is already 9.7 years long.
GRAPHIC: S&P 500 and U.S. recessions - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P03ncw
According to Dana Anspach, 53 percent of all S&P 500 trading days have been ""up"" days and 47 percent have been ""down"" days. In terms of months, the split is 58 percent up and 42 percent down, and in quarters it is 63 percent up and 37 percent down.
The S&P 500 fell 6.9 percent in October, its worst month in seven years. Are valuations now cheap enough and will fragile sentiment solidify enough to spark a rebound? Or will investors' worries over growth, trade, rising U.S. interest rates and future earnings keep the bears in charge?

722,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>",Vietjet to finalize $6.5 billion Airbus order: sources,"By Tim Hepher and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-growing budget carrier Vietjet Aviation (HM:VJC) is set to finalize a $6.5 billion jet order with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) during a visit to Hanoi by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Friday, people familiar with the matter said.
The order for 50 A321neo jets is part of an aggressive investment in the Vietnamese airline's fleet that has provided lucrative business for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
It is also a boost for Airbus as it seeks to turn a raft of provisional orders put together at July's Farnborough Airshow into hard revenues, narrowing a gap against Boeing this year.
The deal is the biggest economic component of an official visit to France's former colony by Philippe from Nov. 2-4, during which he will oversee deals with French firms and hold talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc, they said.
Airbus and Vietjet both declined to comment.
Vietnam and France also signed an agreement in September to expand defense collaboration, although details are scant. 
VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao told Reuters this week that Vietjet plans to maintain an average fleet age of just three years to keep fuel and maintenance costs low.
It placed provisional orders for the A321neo jets and 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets in Farnborough and has been negotiating to firm them up, with deliveries expected between 2020 and 2025. 
The formal signing, to take place on Friday, will help to dispel doubts over the substance of deals announced in Farnborough, which was marked by a rash of vague or incomplete order announcements.
Finalizing such deals can involve tough negotiations as airlines try to squeeze out last-minute concessions.
However, finance industry sources have expressed concerns about a glut of orders in Southeast Asia from airlines like Vietjet, Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and Lion Air of Indonesia and question whether all of the several hundreds of planes on order from the Asian low-cost carriers will actually be delivered.
Vietjet told the Airline Economics conference in Hong Kong this week that low-cost airlines have a relatively low market position in Vietnam, and that those most successful in driving down unit costs would ride out any downturn in the market.
Vietnam's expansion has also been peppered with trade sensitivities as Vietjet - which says it enjoys government support - juggled Airbus and Boeing procurements: a strategy also designed to win bigger discounts.
Two years ago, Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching an order for 100 737s during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama. 
Until then, VietJet had only bought from Airbus, including an order for 92 jets in 2013.

Philippe's visit is the latest example of Western leaders beating a path to Asia's low-cost carriers, whose orders have secured thousands of manufacturing jobs, trade experts said.

723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",October Proves to Be Rare Good Month for Both Gold and Dollar,"(Bloomberg) -- Normally, investors wanting to guess which way gold is headed look to the dollar.
When the greenback goes up, the precious metal almost always goes down. Few assets have a stronger inverse correlation to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, with gold favored as a hedge against the world’s reserve currency.
But that’s not what happened in October, a month when both assets gained ground for the first time in 20 months.
The change has been driven by last month’s rout in emerging market equities, and particularly in China, which has seen investors seek out haven assets. At the same time, the strength of the U.S. economy is benefiting the dollar.
The inverse relationship between gold and the dollar could continue to break down, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at CMC Markets in Sydney. Concerns about rising inflation and the outcome of the midterm Congressional elections could drive gold higher.
“We’re likely to see both a rising U.S. dollar and a rising gold price at least into next Tuesday night,” McCarthy said by phone. The midterms are “a potential game-changer. Predicting beyond that at the moment is very difficult.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 2.3 percent in October to the highest in 17 months, while gold gained 2 percent, the most since January. The metal advanced 0.8 percent to $1,224.64 an ounce at 10:04 a.m. in London.
Risk Aversion
Gold’s gains owe “mostly to the recent de-risking in equity markets that we view as a correction rather than being in the throes of a bear market,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, said by email. While the bank raised its forecasts for gold, it still sees it declining, from an average $1,260 an ounce in 2018 to $1,145 in 2019.
“Risk aversion has crept back in as we’ve seen declines in emerging markets around the world and now Asian markets following,” said Mark O’Byrne, Dublin-based executive director at brokerage Goldcore Ltd. “Fund managers are rebalancing after a very good run on the stock market, taking chips off the table and putting money into gold and cash, hence why the dollar has also risen.”
The inverse correlation on a 120-day basis has been narrowing since June, with the trend accelerating in October. It has gone from as strong as minus 0.75 to less than minus 0.55. A reading of minus 1 means the two are always moving in the opposite direction.
Gold typically acts as a hedge not only against the dollar, but against fiat currencies in general. That the metal is priced in dollars further strengthens the connection.
The reverse correlation faltered in June 2016, after the Brexit vote, and broke down completely during the early stages of the Greek debt crisis in 2010. When things are going badly everywhere else in the world, the dollar and gold act as a haven simultaneously.
Gold and the dollar may continue to rise in tandem in the short term, “but I’d be amazed if that continues into 2019,” said O’Byrne. U.S. policymakers won’t want the currency to go much higher, whereas gold demand is just starting to come back. “So although I wouldn’t want to bet against the dollar in the short-term, longer term it looks very positive for gold.”

725,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Signs of relief emerge for battered U.S. homebuilding stocks,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilders' earnings have been hit by rising mortgage rates in the latest quarter, but their shares are showing signs of recovering. 
The S&P Composite 1500 Homebuilding index <.SPCOMHOME> has dropped 9.4 percent in October and 31.2 percent year-to-date, but the homebuilding stock index has recovered by 8.2 percent since Oct. 24. 
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index lost 6.94 percent in October, its worst month since September 2011, but recovered by 2.1 percent since last Wednesday. 
On Wednesday last week, Wall Street stocks were hit by U.S. Commerce Department data showing September sales of new single-family homes fell to a near two-year low.
The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate rose to 5.11 percent the week of Oct. 19, its highest level since February 2011, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
Since then, mortgage rates have come down again as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, on which they are based, has backed off from its highs earlier in the month.
The industry's outlook has also turned less dire as the earnings season has progressed. 
In early October, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), lowered their financial forecasts for the fourth quarter of 2018, but others, including PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) and  Meritage Homes Corp  (N:MTH), have given more upbeat outlooks for 2019. 
Overall home builder companies have framed the recent slowdown in sales as a momentary pause rather than the beginning of a sustained downturn.
""A significant slowdown could be a warning sign, but that usually happens when people are afraid of the economy and of losing jobs,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""There's no evidence of that yet.""
Several small-capitalization homebuilders, including  LGI Homes  Inc (O:LGIH) and Century Communities Inc (N:CCS), are scheduled to report profit results in the next two weeks. D.R. Horton, the largest U.S. homebuilder by market capitalization, is set to report results on Nov. 8.
Homebuilders' shares have also been pressured by rising home prices. 
Prices had already been elevated as land scarcity and rising materials and labor costs helped to cap the supply of new homes. 
In post-earnings conference calls, homebuilders have noted measures they have taken to address anxieties over rising prices. 
Several, including PulteGroup and Tri Pointe Group Inc (N:TPH), are offering financing incentives. Others, such as Meritage Homes and William Lyon Homes (N:WLH), are placing more emphasis on entry-level homes, which are widely seen by analysts and investors as the most robust segment of the housing market.
Interest from potential buyers has remained strong even though sales have fallen. PulteGroup and Meritage Homes both cited year-over-year traffic increases.
""Interest is still good,"" said Jonathan Woloshin, U.S. head of real estate at UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment office in New York. ""People are just priced out.""
The climb in home prices may be slowing down though.
On Tuesday, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA index indicated a 5.8-percent year-over-year gain in August, the first time in a year home prices had risen less than 6.0 percent.
As a result, some market watchers say homebuilders' shares may be near a trough. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P Composite 1500 Homebuilding index is 8.5, down from 15.9 a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
""The outlook doesn't appear as draconian as the market has priced in,"" said Jack Micenko, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group in New York.
Still, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates in December and in early 2019, which would push up Treasury yields and mortgage rates. While homebuilding stocks may be closer to ending their freefall, reaching the bottom could take several months.
""It will take some time for them to shake out,"" said Dryden Pence, chief investment officer at Pence Wealth Management in Newport Beach, California. ""When the Fed stops raising rates, that's when stability comes back into the housing market.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Financial public relations firm ICR will announce on Thursday that it launched a business to advise corporate boards on governance matters and hired fund industry veteran Lyndon Park to lead it, CEO Tom Ryan said on Wednesday.
Park, 44, joins ICR and its newly created Governance Advisory Solutions practice from Dimensional Fund Advisors where he was head of global corporate governance for the Austin, Texas-based investment firm. Earlier in his career Park was a vice president with investment giant BlackRock's Investment Stewardship unit.
Park will aim to work with corporate boards on issues ranging from board composition to succession planning and what shareholders, including powerful index funds, expect from corporations in the areas of environmental, social and governance programs.
The creation of the new business signals that ICR, based in New York, is entering the fast growing business of advising corporations to protect against activist investors even before they come knocking.
Data from Lazard show that 145 activist campaigns were launched against 136 companies in the first half of 2018 alone, making them the two most active quarters ever. Elliott Management launched 17 new campaigns in the first half of 2018 and Starboard Value, Elliott and Carl Icahn accounted for nearly half of the board seats given to activist investors in the first half, Lazard data show.
ICR will be competing with firms like Sard Verbinnen & Co's Strategic Governance Advisors, co-founded by Chris Cernich, a former top executive at proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and PJT Camberview, founded by Abe Friedman.
Banks also offer activism defense banking services and advice to companies, a niche market currently dominated by Evercore (N:EVR), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Lazard (N:LAZ) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
Park will help boards become more proactive and effective and brings ""a deep understanding of activist tactics and motivations having led engagements and determined proxy outcomes for most of the key activist, hostile takeover, contentious M&A situations and other event-driven situations in recent years while at Dimensional and BlackRock,"" said Phil Denning, a partner at ICR who leads the company's special situations group which oversees the new unit.
As ICR built out its business it also hired Dan McDermott, a former senior associate at ISS, and former Houlihan Lokey banker Jake Noone in the last months, Denning said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) interim chief executive said that it was too early to assess what damage Denmark's largest lender had sustained from a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal and warned of potentially ""big"" fines.
Danske's third quarter earnings on Thursday showed the bank's lending had increased across the Nordic countries, with solid activity among retail and commercial customers, giving its battered shares a welcome respite.
""We should be careful not to underestimate the undercurrent. Because if we look at the bank's reputation, we can see that it is under pressure,"" Jesper Nielsen told Reuters in a telephone interview following the results.
It was therefore too early to say whether the scandal could lead to a significant decline in business volumes, he said after Danske reported a 42 percent fall in third quarter pretax profit, largely the result of a previously announced donation it is making to initiatives to fight financial crime.
""One could have feared that a larger decline in the number of customers and a diminishing use of bank services could have had a greater negative impact,"" investment economist Per Hansen said in a note as Danske shares rose by as much as 6.5 percent.
Investors have been worried about potential fines resulting from the money laundering case, which is the subject of criminal investigations in Denmark, Estonia and the United States.
Before Thursday's increase, Danske's share price had almost halved since February.
BIG FINES 
Nielsen said potential fines resulting from investigations in payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank said in September were suspicious, could be ""big"". He declined to elaborate, adding that no subpoenas have been issued so far.
In order to help the investigations, Danske would relieve others of confidentiality clauses, as it has done in the case of whistleblower Howard Wilkinson, who helped expose the scandal, Nielsen said.
Danske said its pretax profit dropped to 3.59 billion Danish crowns ($547 million), missing the 3.72 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll, after the 1.5 billion crown donation following the money laundering affair.
Nielsen said it had not yet been decided which specific projects would be supported. However, if any income from the non-resident Estonian portfolio becomes subject to confiscation by relevant authorities, it would be deducted from the donation.
Danske stuck to its to its full-year forecast from September for a net profit of between 16 and 17 billion Danish crowns.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 06:51AM ET</span>","Testy talks, tangled taxes: Amazon's slow push into Brazil's retail jungle","By Gram Slattery and Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is struggling to ramp up its operations in Brazil, a promising market that so far has proven difficult for the world's largest online retailer to crack, according to nearly twenty people with knowledge of the situation.
Challenges include the nation's tangled tax system, complicated logistics and testy relations with some prominent vendors, who say the Seattle behemoth has shown little flexibility in negotiating even though it is still a minor e-commerce player in Brazil.
Several well-known firms here, including Brazilian fashion label AMARO and footwear and accessory retailer Arezzo Industria e Comercio SA, have declined Amazon's offers to sell their goods on its platforms, according to seven of the people. Some big electronics manufacturers - such as Lenovo Group Ltd, one of the world's largest computer makers - have inked contracts only in the last few weeks after months of intense wrangling.
No one is counting Amazon out. The company continues to push ahead with plans to construct its own in-house fulfillment and delivery network in Brazil, tasks that currently are handled by the vendors whose merchandise it sells on its site. 
But that initiative is taking longer than expected and, when finally unveiled, is likely to be modest in scope compared to its operations in other emerging markets such as India and Mexico, according to interviews with current and former employees, manufacturers, consultants and others with knowledge of the effort.
Amazon, in response to a list of questions from Reuters, said it did not comment on ""rumors or speculations."" 
AMARO declined to comment. Arezzo and Lenovo had no immediate comment. 
Amazon's rocky Brazil rollout comes as the retailer is under pressure to boost sales outside its core U.S. market. The company's shares were hammered last week after third-quarter results showed disappointing international sales and a slowdown in overall growth.
While Amazon has expanded rapidly in some emerging markets, it continues to play catch-up in Brazil, where strong local competitors dominate. Shares of homegrown e-commerce players B2W Cia Digital SA and Magazine Luiza SA have risen sharply over the past year.
Asset manager Alexandre Silverio, whose firm holds sizeable positions in some of Brazil's largest domestic e-commerce players, said Amazon will have to fight to be king of the jungle here.
""Brazil is very different than other markets. You have to know logistics, taxes,"" said Silverio, head of equities at Sao Paulo-based AZ Quest Investimentos. ""I don't know how the e-commerce market will be composed here in ten years. But in the short-term, I'm not worried"" about Amazon.
TAXES, TRANSPORT AND RED TAPE Amazon has been present in Brazilian retail since 2012. But for most of that time it has stuck mainly to selling books.
The company does not disclose its Brazilian sales, but analysts estimate Amazon's revenue is a fraction of that of B2W and Magazine Luiza. Those firms combined for about $4.75 billion in digital sales in 2017, according to securities filings and presentations.
Amazon made its first big move into merchandise in October 2017, when it began offering the use of its Brazilian website to third-party merchants to sell electronics. Under this business, known as Amazon Marketplace, sellers are responsible for handling their own fulfillment and delivery. In recent months, the firm has slowly expanded its Marketplace and moved into clothing and sporting goods.
But a central strategy for Amazon in markets it dominates is taking all those functions in-house to ensure fast delivery and top-flight customer service. In retail parlance that format is known as ""first party,"" or 1P.
In Brazil, the company over the past year has laid the groundwork for a 1P operation. The firm has purchased a large warehouse outside Sao Paulo, made dozens of hires and discussed logistics partnerships with firms including airline Azul SA, according to several people familiar with the effort.
Amazon had at one point planned to unveil its 1P business in September, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter. Several Amazon counterparties have since described repeated delays in the roll-out.
Some expressed doubt that Amazon would have the new platform ready in time for Brazil's Nov. 23 Black Friday discount day, a date considered unmissable for taking advantage of the Christmas shopping season.
Building out a logistics network has been particularly challenging for Amazon, two people with direct knowledge of its Brazil operations said. 
The country's land mass is larger than that of the continental United States, but key roads are choked with traffic and cargo theft is rampant.
The firm has also found Brazil's Byzantine tax system difficult to navigate, three other people said. Many online retailers here have extensive departments dedicated solely to handling tax matters.
An executive at one of Brazil's largest appliance firms said Amazon officials have pushed back launch estimates for the 1P program several times, citing difficulties in sorting out taxes. 
TALKING TOUGH 
Perhaps the most significant sticking point has been negotiations between Amazon and potential suppliers. Near the beginning of March, Amazon met with Brazil's largest electronics manufacturers at a hotel in southwestern Sao Paulo to introduce its planned 1P service here, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Amazon representatives were surprised at the level of skepticism they encountered, one of the people said.
The officials were ""trying to negotiate with the brands thinking that they were Amazon U.S.,"" said the person, who had direct knowledge of Amazon's bargaining with manufacturers. ""But you are in a market in Brazil with many competitors"" that are significantly larger.
Attendees were put off by what they perceived as the firm's inflexible bargaining position, according to two representatives from major suppliers. They said matters improved little in subsequent one-on-one talks with the retailer. Multiple parties said they felt Amazon was trying to avoid customizing contract terms to the realities of Brazil's idiosyncratic retail market.
For instance, one executive at a major electronics manufacturer cited disagreements with the retailer over how they would split the cost of handling potential customer complaints made to municipal and state consumer protection agencies.
Vendors that have agreed to participate in the 1P platform said it is not shaping up to be a blockbuster for this holiday season. For instance, Lenovo signed a deal just last week and is among a number of major firms that have yet to deliver products to Amazon with Christmas fast approaching, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Three other large firms, including Midea Group Co Ltd, a major producer of kitchen appliances and air conditioners in Brazil, will sell just a small selection of products through Amazon's 1P operation, according to two people familiar with the situation. They described the effort as a modest ""test phase"" to flesh out kinks in the system.
Representatives for Midea did not have an immediate comment.
Asset manager Silverio, meanwhile, is continuing to bet on Amazon's Brazilian competitors.

""There was fear when Amazon first started to eye Brazil,"" he said. ""But it has been doing things very cautiously.""

736,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 06:04AM ET</span>",Strong updates help European shares climb to two-week high,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares hit a two-week high on Thursday as strong results from Dutch bank ING and UK phone group BT helped offset a disappointing update from  Credit Suisse , and ASM International brought some cheer to chipmakers.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.5 percent by 0941 GMT, building on Wednesday's rally when fresh optimism over the earning season helped ease worries over slowing economic growth and political risk which sent the pan-European index close to two-year lows in October.
The UK's FTSE (FTSE) however lagged behind, down 0.1 percent, as the pound strengthened after a British official said London was close to sealing a deal that would give UK-based financial services firms basic access to European Union markets.
ING (AS:INGA) rose 5.1 percent after the largest Dutch bank reported a better-than-expected profit of 776 million euros, as it continued to grow on an underlying basis despite being fined for failures to prevent money laundering.
""ING's earnings are mainly boosted by the lower cost/income ratio as its cost cuts seem to start reaping benefits,"" said Jauke de Jong, a research analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam. 
BT (L:BT) rallied 8.6 percent after it reported a better-than-expected 2 percent rise in first-half earnings and nudged its guidance for the full year higher. The stock was on track for its best day since May 2013. 
Results from ING and BT lifted the banks and telecoms indexes up 1.1 and 2.1 percent respectively, bringing relief to sectors which are among the worst perfomers so far this year in Europe and have suffered due to their poor earnings outlook.
BHP Billiton (L:BLT) rose to a two-week high after the mining giant said it would return $10.4 billion to shareholders, sticking to a promise to hand back all of the proceeds from the sale of its U.S. shale business.
ASM International (AS:ASMI) rallied 15 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 and was track for its biggest one day gain since 2009 after issuing a bullish outlook, countering fears of a downturn in the semiconductor market.
Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) was a weak spot. 
Its shares fell 2.7 percent after its third-quarter net profit fell short of expectations, even after the bank said it would return to the black in the full year for the first time since Tidjane Thiam became chief executive in 2015.
Oil stocks also fell after Shell (AS:RDSa) slightly missed expectations, sending its shares down 1.8 percent.
Profits at the Anglo-Dutch oil major however soared to a four-year high in the third quarter, boosted by rising oil prices as the company accelerated its giant $25 billion share buyback program.
Investors cheered the strong rise in its cash generation.
""It's all about the incredible cashflow story today... we recommend being heavily invested as the company is well on track to deliver its 2020 FCF plan,"" Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint wrote in a note.
Seismic oil services firms TGS (OL:TGS) dived 9.6 percent to its lowest since early May after its third quarter operating profit fell more than expected.
Overall, European earnings are expected to have risen 14.2 percent in the third quarter, up from a previous forecast of less than 13 percent, according to the IBES Refinitiv data. 

By the end of the week, companies representing around 40 percent of the STOXX 600's market cap will have reported quarterly results.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 06:03AM ET</span>",Japanese carmakers' weapon of choice in Trump trade war: Flexible factories,"By Nick Carey
SMYRNA, Tenn. (Reuters) - At points along the assembly line at Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7201.T largest U.S. factory, workers wheel trolleys past shelves selecting parts wherever they see a green or blue light.
Nissan calls the system ""pick to the light,"" and it helps workers get the right part for whichever of six different vehicles built at the plant, according to Ryan Fulkerson, director of new model engineering during a walk along the line.
""No matter which model comes down the line, the right parts are waiting for it,"" said Fulkerson.
Designing assembly lines to build more than one type of vehicle dates back decades. But the ability to shift production from one type of vehicle to another is now proving vital for an automotive industry coping with multiple challenges.
Consumers around the world are shifting rapidly away from traditional sedans in favor of sport utility vehicles. The recent rise in U.S. gasoline prices is a reminder that a more serious oil price shock could make smaller vehicles popular again. Trade tensions and tariffs threaten companies that ship significant numbers of vehicles from one country to another.
Weakening China sales, market stagnation in America and fears of a full-blown trade war have only added to uncertainty, spooking auto investors.

Nissan and rival Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have been the best at flexible manufacturing, auto experts and industry executives said. Historically, Japanese automakers focused on interchangeable processes and platforms out of necessity - because one model for the Japanese market could not sustain an entire factory.
U.S. and European automakers have worked to catch up. For example, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's F.N Kentucky truck plant makes some of its best-selling pickup trucks and large SUVs on the same platform, and is expected to hit full capacity this year.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2yxAj1O
But General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) GM.N illustrates some of the pitfalls of relying on single models. While The No. 1 automaker's U.S. plants producing popular pickup trucks are running around the clock to meet demand, others that make a single car model are running well below capacity.
At the GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, workers make only the Cruze compact sedan, which has suffered a 26.5 percent sales decline this year through September. The plant is running a little over 30 percent capacity, on one shift.
""We continuously look at our global operations to find ways to drive greater efficiency and capacity utilization,"" GM said in a statement.
Workers at Lordstown are campaigning for GM to build another vehicle at the plant to make it viable. The UAW has consolidated two locals at the facility to simplify the negotiating process. It also has agreed to allow outsourcing of some non-production jobs and worked to significantly improve quality.
Dave Green, UAW Local 1112 president, said his members are on edge.
""We're doing all we can to be competitive,"" Green said. ""We know that if we can't compete, we're out of business.""
""PEOPLE ARE MORE FLEXIBLE""
Using one assembly line to build a variety of different body styles requires careful coordination that starts with the engineers who design the vehicles, and extends to the construction of the tools used to weld and assemble them.
Honda's assembly factory in Greensburg, Indiana started operation in 2008 building Civic sedans, and later a small sedan for the Acura brand. Last year, as sedan sales weakened and demand for SUVs soared, Honda decided to add production of its compact CR-V utility vehicle at Greensburg.
Honda had designed the CR-V and Civic so they could be put together on the same line, but engineers and workers at the Greensburg plant had to make changes.
Before the CR-V was introduced, Civic trunks and hoods were welded together by one group of machines, or cell, in the body shop. The metal pieces for the hood and trunk lid were placed in an industrial-strength Lazy Susan and the same robots welded them both.
However, the tailgate of the CR-V is a bigger piece that requires 37 more welds. The same system would not work for both the Civic and CR-V. An entirely new welding line to handle the CR-V work would be too expensive, and the plant had no space, said Honda engineer Zach McCurdy during a tour of the plant.
Instead, McCurdy and other engineers separated the hood welding line from the Civic trunk and CR-V tailgate welding system, reusing many of the robots. The plant bought 10 more welding robots – fewer than originally proposed. During a planned production week-long shutdown, workers reconfigured the area of the welding shop.
Honda has not pushed automation to the limit at Greensburg, managers at the plant said. Workers load parts by hand into fixtures that hold them in place so robots can weld them together. Such repetitive work could be automated, said the Greensburg plant's new model manager, Tom Hilfinger. But it does not pay off.
“People are more flexible,” he said.
RUNNING AT A HIGH RATE
The Nissan plant in Smyrna has two lines that can each produce 60 vehicles an hour. The plant's 8,000-plus workers make six different vehicles on two production lines here - three SUVs and three cars, including Nissan's best-selling, higher-margin Rogue SUV crossover. Last year Smyrna made 623,000 vehicles, more than 97 percent of its capacity, and it is running over 90 percent now.
Auto plants need to operate at 80 percent of capacity or above to remain profitable.
To keep Smyrna running at a high rate, Nissan last year exported 100,000 vehicles to 70 countries. The automaker still imports most of the Rogues it sells in the United States, to avoid idle production lines at plants in Japan and South Korea.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose auto tariffs of up to 25 percent. That would be a direct hit to companies such as Nissan, which imported two thirds of the 310,000 Rogues it has sold in America during the first nine months of this year.
Denis Le Vot, who heads Nissan North America, declined to discuss the possibility of Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles.

But when asked if Nissan could make those imported Rogues in the United States if faced with a massive supply chain disruption, Le Vot said: ""Sure, we can.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks started the new month on firmer ground on Thursday after a brutal October, while sterling rallied on reports that Britain and the European Union are close to a post-Brexit deal on financial services.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day.
October was the index's worst month since May 2012 - a loss of 7.5 percent - as shares globally took a battering on a number of factors ranging from trade wars to concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates.
European markets followed a strong start in Asia, with robust company earnings helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index hit a two-week high. (EU)
Britain's FTSE 100 however fell 0.1 percent as the pound strengthened on a report Britain and the EU are close to a deal that would give financial services firms in the UK continued access to European markets once Brexit happens.
""This is a significant development for the pound as it alleviates some market concerns on how London would finance its big current deficit,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since August 2015.
The improved mood had filtered down to Asia from Wall Street, which rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favorites lifted spirits. (N)
Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.5 percent on Thursday and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent following two days of big gains.
""What we are seeing is the equity markets trying to rebound after bottoming out. Corporate earnings in the U.S. and Japanese markets have been relatively strong on the whole, which means there are plenty of bargain hunting opportunities,"" said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo.
RISK SENTIMENT RECOVERS
In currencies, sterling's rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. The index measuring the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.6 percent at 96.539.
The index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) national employment report showing U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October.
The dollar has enjoyed a boost from robust data, including last week's GDP numbers which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter.
The Australian dollar and the Kiwi dollar were up 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent respectively after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia's biggest trading partner.
""We've got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
In another sign risk sentiment was improving, Scandinavian currencies - the Norwegian crown and Swedish crown - rallied as well.
The euro rose over half a percent to $1.1376 after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August.
The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone.
In commodities, U.S. crude futures were down 0.86 percent at $64.75 per barrel and Brent crude lost 1.13 percent to $74.19 per barrel. [O/R]

740,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Bumper China Evergrande bond deal set to heap pain on rival developers,"By Clare Jim and Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group's $1.8 billion bond sale this week has sent a chill through Asia's dollar bond markets, with the dizzying coupons offered by the property developer casting doubts on fundraising plans of rivals.
Chinese developers, a perennial feature of the region's junk bond markets and formerly an investor favorite, are already facing a cooling property market, rising interest rates and market volatility driven by economic jitters. 
Evergrande's bumper deal is expected to raise borrowing costs and potentially price some out of the market altogether just as the industry faces a heavy refinancing load, raising the risk of default for the weakest players. 
Developers have a combined $33.4 billion of bonds maturing in the first quarter of 2019, according to Refintiv data. Of that, $5 billion is offshore, the rest in mainland yuan-denominated bonds.
Debt-laden Evergrande this week complicated the situation for its rivals after it sold a combined $1.8 billion in two-, four- and five-year debt.
Its chairman and founder Hui Ka Yan bought $1 billion of the longer-dated debt, helping the sale size. The coupons Evergrande paid - 11 per cent for the two-year notes, 13 per cent for the four-year bonds and 13.75 per cent on the five-year debt - were also among the highest in the market. 
The coupons on the four- and five-year bonds were the highest offered by any issuer of similar-dated paper this year, according to Refinitiv data. 
Asia's junk bond market saw two days of selling following the news of Evergrande's deal. Traders said Evergrande's new two-year bonds traded as much as 1.5 points lower in the afternoon of its debut, while other developers' bonds slipped by up to 0.5 points.
""Issuances will be priced at wider spreads, so how can secondary ones perform?"" said Manjesh Verma, head of Asia credit sector specialists at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), referring to the way investors would compare older deals against the newer higher-yielding ones.
'AVERSE TO DURATION'
Only five companies have paid more for two-year bonds, according to Refinitiv data, and four of them were unrated bonds which typically have higher coupons than those with a credit rating. 
Evergrande's high borrowing costs could further pressure rivals who are scrambling to satisfy their own refinancing needs.
""It means weaker and smaller players to Evergrande might have to revise their pricing expectations or they might even be priced out of the market because of this repricing,"" said Christopher Yip, S&P senior director of corporate ratings. 
Last month, Shimao Property, which had approval to issue up to $820 million of bonds, scrapped the sale of a five-year bond entirely, and trimmed its three-year sale to $250 million. 
The coupon on Shimao's three-year bond, which has a rating by Moody's two notches higher than Evergrande, was 6.375 percent.
""The Shimao deal is very telling; it is one of the best private sector China property credits out there, them failing to do a five-year deal really shows that the market is really averse to duration at the moment,"" said a debt capital markets banker, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
Shimao declined to comment.
A banker involved in Evergrande's bond sale said chairman Hui's involvement showed his confidence in the company. Some investors said it showed limited appetite for the debt despite the sky-high rates on offer. 
""Those stats are pretty awful - there were no real buyers for the four- and five-year deal,"" said one fund manager who has previously bought Evergrande notes, but passed on this deal. 
Credit analysts say it is increasingly hard to issue five-year or longer-dated bonds given the weak markets, which makes the Evergrande deal stand out even more.

""Those days have gone for now,"" said Steve Wang, senior credit analyst at CITIC CLSA.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday that it would begin accepting cash fares in Mexico City, seizing on a recent Supreme Court decision, though local government has yet to approve the form of payment.
Uber waged a long campaign for cash fares in Mexico where roughly 60 percent of the population lacks a bank account.
Mexico's top court sided with the company two weeks ago, finding that a state ban on cash fares for ride-hailing firms was unconstitutional, setting a national precedent.
Although a cash ban in Mexico City is still in place, Uber decided to begin accepting the fares, acting in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision, said Federico Ranero, the company's Mexico chief executive. 
""Because of the importance of this precedent, and because of our mission, we're deciding to (accept cash) now, and we're collaborating closely with authorities to make sure that all of those regulations will be adapted,"" he said in an interview. 
Uber has not decided if it will legally challenge Mexico City's ban but views that as a last resort, Ranero said.
Mexico City's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Uber launched in the capital in 2013 and soon dominated the market, but Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing entered Mexico earlier this year to challenge Uber.
Before the Supreme Court decision, Uber accepted cash in all but two of the 43 Mexican cities where it operates.
Still, when Uber was first negotiating with Mexico City regulators, it did not want to bill in cash, preferring to stick to credit cards, said Carlos Camacho, president of consulting firm Strategic Affairs Group, who advised Uber at the time.
Uber sells pre-paid gift cards to accommodate users without credit cards and is working on other payment methods to reach the unbanked, Ranero said. He declined to provide details.
Accepting cash in Mexico City will extend the service to about 10 million people in the metropolitan area, Uber estimates. The company has said that more than half of its trips in Mexico are paid for in cash.
The use of cash has sparked concerns that Uber drivers could become targets for robbery. In addition to its normal safety precautions, Uber verifies the identities of users who want to pay in cash by checking their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profiles, Ranero said. 

The company has not seen an increase in security incidents in Mexican cities where it accepts cash, he added.

iHeartMedia is hoping the iPhone maker will take an equity stake worth millions of dollars, the FT reported citing one of the sources.
The tie-up could result in a multimillion-dollar marketing partnership rather than a direct investment, the report said citing another source.
iHeartMedia filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, after reaching an agreement with creditors to more than halve its $20 billion debt.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Malaysian financier's private jet linked to 1MDB scandal to be sold,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A U.S. court has allowed the sale of a private jet allegedly bought by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho with money taken from Malaysia's scandal-linked state fund 1MDB, court filings showed. 
The Bombardier Global 5000 jet is among $1.7 billion in assets allegedly purchased by Low, also known as Jho Low, and his associates with funds stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has said.
The jet is the second asset linked to 1MDB to go on sale. Earlier this week, Malaysia put up for auction the Equanimity, a $250 million luxury yacht, also allegedly bought by Low.
A judge in a California court agreed on Wednesday to a proposal between the DoJ and the company that owns the jet, Global One Aviation, to sell the aircraft. 
The parties cited possible risk of damage and the cost of maintaining the jet, which is currently in Singapore.
A spokesman for Global One Aviation said a formal bidding process should start immediately.
""This agreement has been reached in cooperation with the United States government to ensure that the parties' legal rights with respect to the jet are maintained, and that the jet's value is not depleted while these claims are appropriately resolved,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement. 
The court said bids for the Bombardier jet should meet or exceed a minimum reserve price, which Global One Aviation proposed to be set at $5.4 million. The court filing did not give a reason for the lower valuation of the aircraft. 
The DoJ has said that some $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB, and used by Low and his associates to buy the jet, the yacht, as well as Picasso paintings, jewelry, and real estate.
The Malaysian government said in August it wanted to repossess the aircraft.
Low, the target of a Malaysian arrest warrant, has denied wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown.
The proceeds from the sale will be held in an account maintained by the U.S. pending the conclusion of the asset forfeiture case, the court said.
In a separate filing on Wednesday, the court agreed to replace Jho Low's stake in EMI Music Publishing in the forfeiture case with the proceeds from a proposed stake sale to Sony Corp (T:6758). 

The U.S. civil lawsuits had sought to seize Low's $107 million stake in EMI which the DOJ said was bought with stolen 1MDB funds. In May, Sony made a $2.3 billion offer to gain control of EMI.

The yuan advanced after the central bank set the fixing at a stronger-than-expected level.
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 percent as of 10:27 a.m. local time, set for the first three-day rising streak in more than two months. Brokerages jumped, while technology stocks were among the best performers onshore and in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 1.4 percent. The yuan strengthened 0.07 percent to 6.9691 per dollar.
China needs to take timely steps to counter the increasing downward pressure on economic growth, according to a statement from a Politburo meeting Wednesday chaired by President Xi Jinping. Separately, securities regulators have asked brokerages to help relieve liquidity pressure for listed private companies, the Securities Times reported, without specifying where it got the information.
""The politburo meeting remarks about reinvigorating the capital market showed the top leadership is caring for the market,"" said Shen Zhenyang, a Shanghai-based analyst with Northeast Securities Co. ""That’s boosting sentiment.""
Officials have announced a slew of measures in recent weeks to stem a rout in mainland equities that has set the Shanghai index on course for its worst year since 2011. The gauge is among the world’s worst-performing major indexes in 2018, tumbling more than 20 percent, as trade relations with the U.S. soured, the yuan weakened and the Chinese economy slowed faster than expected. Data this week showed China’s manufacturing sector expanded at a slower pace last month.
The yuan was poised to rise for the first time in four sessions. The currency this week dropped to a decade-low, moving closer to the key level of 7 per dollar, and putting spotlight on capital outflows from China. Policymakers will likely allow the yuan to hit 7 within the next six months without conducting heavy intervention,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said before Thursday’s fixing.
“The yuan fixing suggests the PBOC may be doing a bit of tug of war with market forces, and is still pulling to resist the yuan breaking 7,” said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy at National Australia Bank in Singapore. “But we may be at the tail end of this and the PBOC doesn’t look like it will apply booster force against where the market is tugging at.”
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rallied 1.4 percent, with Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. set for its biggest two-day gain since July 2015. Stocks in the city capped a six-month losing streak in October, the worst in 36 years.

(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) reported a smaller quarterly loss on Wednesday as reinsurance pacts helped offset steep catastrophe losses in Japan and North America.
The insurer posted a net loss of $1.26 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.91 per share, a year earlier.
AIG recorded net pretax catastrophe losses of $1.6 billion in the quarter, mainly related to typhoons in Japan and Hurricane Florence, that were largely in line with the insurer's preview of those losses in mid-October.
The figures, far worse than analysts were expecting, helped spur a 13 percent drop in AIG shares during recent weeks. The shares were down 1.1 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday.
AIG's revised estimates for California mudslides also contributed to its losses.
AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault, who took charge in May 2017, has vowed to turn the company around and post an underwriting profit as soon as year-end.
But some analysts are not convinced his plan is working. ""The third quarter results do not suggest progress in and of themselves,"" Sandler O'Neill analyst Paul Newsome said in an interview.
AIG has not made much progress in improving underwriting profit in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, even without the catastrophe losses, Newsome said. But there are some signs that AIG's loss ratio is improving, he said.
AIG estimated it has exhausted about $700 million of the $750 million available through its North American catastrophe reinsurance program following the mudslides, Hurricane Florence and loss estimate from Hurricane Michael, which crashed into Florida earlier this month.
The adjusted pretax loss from the general insurance business narrowed 72 percent to $825 million, while the underwriting loss narrowed to $1.73 billion from $3.8 billion a year ago.
Adjusted pretax income from the life and retirement business fell 38 percent to $713 million, driven by changes to some actuarial assumptions following an annual review.
The company's combined ratio fell to 124.4 percent from 157.1 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Loss ratio fell to 88.6 percent from 124.1 percent in the year-ago quarter, when it recorded pretax catastrophe losses of $3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
On an adjusted basis, it lost 34 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 12 cents, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 09:16PM ET</span>",VW and Ford in talks on self-driving and electric vehicles: source,"By Edward Taylor and Ben Klayman
FRANKFURT/DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are in ""exploratory talks"" to jointly develop self-driving and electric vehicles in a far-reaching strategic alliance meant to save the companies billions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The German and U.S. automakers are expected to provide an update on the progress of the talks before year end, said the person, who asked not to be identified.
Spokesmen for both automakers would only reiterate what they have said before about the companies collaborating on the development of commercial vehicles.
""Our (memorandum of understanding) with VW covers conversations about potential collaborations across a number of areas. It is premature to share additional details at this time,"" Ford spokesman Alan Hall said in an email.
Automakers globally are discussing teaming up to share the cost of developing autonomous and electric vehicles. Partnerships on autonomous driving technology differ by region. 
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) this month said it would invest $2.75 billion and take a stake in General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise Automation self-driving vehicle unit to jointly develop autonomous vehicles for deployment in ride service fleets globally. 
VW and Ford are under pressure to roll out more EVs in Europe, where emissions rules are being tightened in the wake of Volkswagen's diesel emissions pollution scandal. 
Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter on Tuesday said the carmaker was open to deeper alliances with outside companies, particularly in the area of autonomous driving. 
Witter said sharing the carmaker's electric cars platform MEB with Ford was theoretically possible, although VW is currently focused on rolling out the electric vehicle technologies among its own brands.
VW officials have repeatedly emphasized that the only way to make electric cars a mass market product is through economies of scale to make them as cheap or cheaper than diesel vehicles.
VW Group is investing 34 billion euros into e-mobility and autonomous driving by 2022 and plans to make 2 million to 3 million full-battery electric cars by 2025. VW's MEB project already includes 50 billion euros in battery cell procurement by 2025. 
Ford executives and other sources previously told Reuters the two automakers were in talks about expanding product and technology alliances.
VW and Ford are already part of a joint venture, dubbed IONITY, with BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) to develop an ultrafast EV charging station network across Europe.
In July, Ford created a separate $4 billion unit to house its self-driving vehicle operations and was seeking outside investors in a move similar to one made by GM with Cruise.

Ford said then it would invest $4 billion through 2023 in its newly formed Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, including the $1 billion it previously had earmarked for Argo AI, the Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup that Ford acquired in 2017.

(Reuters) - The school groundskeeper who won a jury trial against Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn)  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit over allegations that the company's glyphosate-containing weed-killers caused his cancer, accepted a court-mandated reduced punitive damages award on Wednesday.
The decision by Dewayne Johnson, who sued Monsanto in 2016, brings the total award to $78 million, down from the jury's verdict on Aug. 10 of $289 million - $39 million in compensatory and $250 million in punitive damages.
Johnson's law firm said in a statement that he accepted the reduction ""to hopefully achieve a final resolution within his lifetime."" 
Judge Suzanne Bolanos of San Francisco's Superior Court of California, who oversaw the trial, earlier this month affirmed the liability portion of the verdict, but ordered punitive damages to be slashed to concur with California and federal law.
Bayer denies allegations that glyphosate can cause cancer and said it will appeal the decision as the verdict was not supported by the evidence presented at trial.
The verdict, which marked the first such decision against Monsanto, wiped 10 percent off the value of the company and shares have since dropped nearly 30 percent from their pre-verdict value.
The company, which faces more than 8,700 U.S. lawsuits over glyphosate, says decades of scientific studies and real-world use have shown glyphosate to be safe for human use.
Regulators around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have found glyphosate was not a likely carcinogen to humans and approved the chemical, but the cancer unit of the World Health Organization in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
The jury found the company's glyphosate-containing RoundUp and Ranger Pro products responsible for causing Johnson's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and said the company had failed to warn him and other consumers of the risks. 
Johnson could decide whether to accept the reduction or face a new trial on the punitive damages portion.

His lawyers on Wednesday said they would challenge the amount of damages during Bayer's appeal.

The off-market buyback will start this month and will return $5.2 billion to holders, while the balance then will be paid out as a special dividend, the company said Thursday in a statement. This latest capital management steps will bring the total cash returned to shareholders to $21 billion over the past two years, the company said.
“We made a commitment that all the net proceeds from the disposal of our onshore U.S. assets would be returned to shareholders and we are honoring that commitment now that the sale transactions have been completed,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said
BHP made a gross $10.5 billion on the sale to  BP  plc (LON:BP) of its interests in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian onshore U.S. oil and gas assets, announced back in July.
Earlier in the year, BHP came under pressure from activist fund Elliott Management Corp. to divest assets and restructure the organization, including potentially dropping its dual-listing in London and Sydney, to unlock $22 billion in value to shareholders."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's antitrust court has approved a plan by LATAM Airlines (SN:LAN), the region’s largest carrier, to deepen its ties with  American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) and IAG’s (L:ICAG) British Airways and Iberia, LATAM Airlines said in a statement.
The company's chief executive said the TDLC court had approved the link up between the aviation firms, all members of the Oneworld Alliance, in relation to both passenger and cargo planes. 
“This decision sets an important precedent for commercial aviation in our region,"" said Enrique Cueto. ""As has been shown in other parts of the world where these alliances already exist, it represents an opportunity to ensure the growth of the industry, increase passenger traffic and generate more tourism and business travel and bolster the economy."" 
The agreements have already been approved by authorities in Uruguay, Colombia and Brazil.
In November 2016, Chile’s FNE competition regulator said the so-called Joint Business Agreements between Chile-headquartered LATAM, American Airlines Group Inc and IAG risked increasing fares and lowering quality on routes. Its comments raised fears that the country's TDLC antitrust court might reject the deal. 
The JBAs will allow the airlines to coordinate schedules and prices for flights, similar to the North Atlantic revenue-sharing agreement which already exists between IAG and American Airlines.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm the ruling with the court.

(Reuters) - National Australia Bank (NAB) (AX:NAB) posted a 14 percent fall in annual cash earnings on Thursday as the country's fourth-largest lender grapples with the costs of compensating customers and a series of compliance failures.
Cash earnings came in at A$5.70 billion ($4.0 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30, compared with a record A$6.64 billion profit over the same period last year. The result was slightly below an average estimate of A$5.76 billion in a Reuters poll of 6 analysts.
Australia's biggest business lender said its business and private banking division, its largest contributor to earnings, fell 3.6 percent during the second half to A$1.4 billion, as lower margins hit.
""The business bank is one of NAB's strengths in this environment - relative to the other banks with higher exposures to housing - so this is a big surprise,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management.
Revelations of widespread malfeasance in a months-long quasi-judicial inquiry into the sector has put Australia's largest financial institutions under unprecedented scrutiny, raising the specter of costly legal battles and tougher regulation ahead.
NAB announced that it had recognized A$360 million in customer-related remediation charges in the second half of the year, after earlier announcing it was setting aside A$314 million for compliance costs and for refunding customers it overcharged. 
A Royal Commission of inquiry raised instances where the bank failed to treat customers with care and respect, the bank said in a statement. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Thorburn has said about 300 staff have been fired or have left the bank as a result of internal investigations into misconduct. 
HIGH DIVIDEND AT RISK
Despite its lower profits, the Melbourne-based lender announced a final dividend of A$0.99 per share for the half, bringing its full year dividend to A$1.98 per share, the same as last year.
""We think there's a risk NAB would have to cut their dividend,"" said Dive. ""They are paying most of their profits back and not building any capital so we don't think they can maintain such a high payout in this environment.""
NAB reported a increase in its CET1 ratio to 10.2 percent as of Sept. 30, short of the government mandated 10.5 percent by 2020 and behind its three big peers.
NAB added that it had made progress in its plans to separate and offload its wealth management unit, MLC, via an IPO or a sale by the end of 2019. 
Statutory net profit, which includes one-time gains and losses, rose 5 percent to A$5.55 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It may not be time to write an obituary for what is usually called a ""balanced"" investment portfolio.
But October has been unusually cruel to people invested in both U.S. stocks and bonds on the assumption that one will rise while the other falls.
The month marked only the 12th time since the March 2009 dawn of the U.S. bull market that stocks and bonds fell in tandem.
(For a graphic on 'U.S. stocks vs. bonds' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CQOd1Y)
That is a nasty statistic for investors, including retirees, who hoped their investments would hold their value while they live on the dividends stocks pay and the coupons bonds offer.
Bonds did badly because of the jump in yields as benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields hit a 7-1/2-year high. Stocks fell because of rising yields and U.S.-China trade tensions.
""Typically during a stock market downturn we expect investors to exit stocks and park their money in bonds,"" said Magdalena Johndrow, financial advisor at Johndrow Wealth Management LLC. ""That didn't happen in October.""
Mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investors responded to the market slide by retreating, pulling out more than $14 billion of both stocks and bonds, according to Refinitiv's Lipper research service.
The rest of the year will continue to test investors, with a congressional election next month, further talks on U.S.-China trade issues and little clarity about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will pull back on efforts to tighten monetary policy.
Johndrow said investors are waiting to see if market volatility is pointing to a recession or not, and that along with rising U.S. interest rates is keeping them from putting more money into bonds.
The simultaneous slide has also hurt institutional investors and hedge funds that hold both stocks and debt and look to balance their risk, such as ""risk parity"" funds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded for a second day on Wednesday as investors snapped up beaten-down technology and internet favorites and strong company results lifted spirits, even as the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years.
The S&P 500 lost 6.9 percent in October, while the Nasdaq shed 9.2 percent, its biggest monthly loss since November 2008. 
Fears of rising borrowing costs, global trade disputes and a possible slowdown in U.S. corporate profits spooked equity investors this month, with technology and internet names that had powered the market's rally taking the biggest hit.
""People are just happy to have the month of October over,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""All of the fears that popped up last week are being pushed into the background right now. I don't know if it's going to have any legs to it. Just a few earnings in the next few days can change things a lot.""
On Wednesday, shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) gained 3.8 percent after the social media giant said margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease.
The S&P communication services index (SPLRCL), which also houses Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), rose 2.1 percent. The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) ended up 2.4 percent on the day. 
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which is due to report results after the bell on Thursday, climbed as well, by 4.4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.
The Nasdaq gained 3.6 percent in the last two sessions, its biggest two-day percentage gain since June 2016.
General Motors Co (N:GM) shares jumped 9.1 percent to notch their biggest one-day gain since late May, after the No. 1 U.S. automaker posted robust quarterly results and forecast strong full-year earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 241.12 points, or 0.97 percent, to 25,115.76, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 29.11 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,711.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 144.25 points, or 2.01 percent, to 7,305.90.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed gauge of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, had its lowest close since Oct. 23.
The Dow lost 5.1 percent for the month, its biggest monthly percentage decline since January 2016. 
October also marked only the 12th time since the start of the current equity bull market that both stocks and U.S. Treasury bonds produced losses in the same month, based on preliminary data.

Mostly stronger-than-expected results have pushed up third-quarter profit growth estimates for S&P 500 companies to 26.3 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv data.
Defensive sectors were the only decliners. The S&P consumer staples index (SPLRCS) fell 0.9 percent.
Shares of Kellogg (N:K) fell 8.9 percent after cutting its full-year profit forecast due to higher advertising and distribution costs.
The financial sector (SPSY) rose 1.4 percent and the S&P 500 regional banks index <.SPLRCBNKS> gained 1.9 percent, on the Federal Reserve's proposal to ease regulations for U.S. banks with less than $700 billion in assets.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.59-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 38 new highs and 114 new lows.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve unveils proposal to ease regulations for larger banks,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it wants to ease regulations for U.S. lenders with less than $700 billion in assets, a way to lessen the burden on big commercial lenders that do not have volatile Wall Street businesses.
Under the Fed proposal, midsized lenders including U.S. Bancorp (N:USB),  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), PNC Financial Corp (N:PNC) and  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) would face lower liquidity and compliance requirements, and smaller banks would get even easier treatment.
The proposal stems from a law Congress passed in May that ordered the Fed to reduce regulatory burdens on community and regional lenders.
Under the proposal, which is subject to a comment period and may be revised, there would be four tiers of regulation for banks with over $100 billion in assets. Those with $250 billion to $700 billion in assets could enjoy a reduced liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which requires banks to hold high-quality assets that could easily be turned into cash. Banks in that range could see their liquidity requirements reduced by as much as 30 percent, the Fed said.
Smaller banks would have even less restrictive requirements and face stress tests of their capital plans less often than the annual exam the Fed now conducts.
Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, said the changes should ""meaningfully"" reduce compliance costs for banks without injecting significant new risk into the banking system.
""These proposals embody an important principle: the character of regulation should match the character of a firm,"" he said.
Globally systemic banks based in the United States that have large capital markets businesses would not be affected by the proposed changes. Those include JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
The proposal also gives the Fed flexibility to impose stricter rules on banks with less than $700 billion in assets if they engage in higher levels of risky activity. The banking industry expressed disappointment. The proposal falls short and fails to address underlying issues with bank regulations, the Bank Policy Institute said. ""It does not do enough to tailor regulations based on banks' risk profiles,"" said Greg Baer, who heads the group.
The proposal was also met with criticism from advocates for stricter rules on Wall Street.
""Deregulating some of the largest banks in the country will make the financial system less safe, less stable and less protected from another crash,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the pro-reform group Better Markets.
One Fed governor, Lael Brainard, voted against the proposal, arguing it went beyond Congress's intent and exposed the financial system to unnecessary risk.

Although the proposal did not address U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks, the Fed said it intends to propose a separate rule for them ""in the near future."" It is also working with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on changes to a requirement that big banks create plans for dismantlement in case of failure, known as “living wills.”

771,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Apple Dominates the Earnings Day
The foot is off the gas a little in earnings before the bell and eyes will be on Apple tomorrow, which issues results postmarket.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have averted the bloodbath in tech of the last month, trading lower but in a modest range. But the stock is higher over the last three months.
On average, analysts expect the company to post a profit of $2.78 per share on revenue of about $61.4 billion.
Total iPhone sales tend to be the big metric, with Zacks predicting a little fewer than 47 million in the quarter. The new iPhones should have less of an impact, being released later in the period.
Also reporting after the bell is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), with analysts forecasting a rise in earnings and sales from the same quarter a year ago.
Before the start of trading, health insurance giant Cigna (NYSE:CI) will weigh in with numbers. And there will be results from insurer MetLife (NYSE:MET) as well postmarket.
2. Jobless Claims, ISM Manufacturing Highlight Economic Data
Economic indicators for tomorrow bring another batch of employment numbers ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
Initial jobless claims for last week arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists predict that claims for first-time unemployment benefits stayed roughly the same at 213,000 last week.
Continuing claims are forecast to have risen slightly to 1.64 million from 1.636 million.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing purchasers managing index (PMI) is reported.
The measure of manufacturing activity is expected to have ticked down to 59 in October from 59.8 in September.
A small drop in the ISM’s employment measure is also forecast.
3. Gold Could Be in for Trouble as Risk Appetite Returns
Gold has been struggling to have much overall market impact this year. But the next few trading days could be interesting, coming off its best monthly gain since January at a time when equities are finding their feet again.
Gold futures ended up 2% for October, but looked set to post much stronger gains before this week when the rally in stock markets pulled money back into riskier assets.
If the yellow metal slides near term, it could be a further indication that risk is back on the table in places like beleaguered tech stocks.
Still, some analyst believe that gold’s October performance is nothing to sneeze at given the background of a stronger dollar, which tends to hurt gold prices.
“I don‘t expect the rug to be pulled out from under the gold price,” said Walter Pehowich, executive vice president at Dillon Gage Metals in Addison, Texas. “At this juncture though, we need a lower dollar and lower equity prices for gold to recover.”"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.97%, but is down about 4% for month. The S&P 500 rose 1.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.01%. The S&P 500 has lost about 6% in October and the Nasdaq is down about 8%, its largest monthly slump since November 2008.
Wall Street closed the curtain on October in bullish form as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s stronger-than-expected earnings overshadowed a slight revenue miss and slowing user growth, sending its shares more than 4% higher, lifting the broader tech sector.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose more than 4%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose 4%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 3% as investors looked ahead to the iPhone maker's quarterly report slated for Thursday after market close.
Both the S&P 500 Information Technology index and the S&P 500 Communication Services index, which includes Netflix, Facebook and Alphabet and telecom companies, closed more than 2% higher.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) also fuelled the rally on Wall Street after it posted a blowout quarterly report and showed strong growth in China despite slowing growth in the country, prompting a wave of bullish calls from analysts. Its shares rose about 9%.
""The fact that General Motors China turned in a record third-quarter is also encouraging because it shows that General Motors can earn solid profits in a variety of economic scenarios in that country,"" JPMorgan said.
Energy, meanwhile, also participated in the rally, gaining nearly 1%, shrugging off slump in oil prices. Oil prices posted their biggest monthly loss in 2-1/2 years.
On the trade front, President Donald Trump's top economic advisor attempted to temper fears of an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, railing against recent reports that the U.S. was looking to implement further tariffs on China.
""Nothing is set in stone right now,"" Larry Kudlow told CNBC on Wednesday.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
Ahead of the all-important October nonfarm payrolls report due Friday, market participants were treated to a better-than-expected report on the private labor market.
Private payrolls grew by 227,000 for the month, above the 218,000 seen in September, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecasts of 189,000.

As the U.S. stock market headed for its worst month in seven years, equity funds have slumped 6.8 percent through Monday, Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage group said in a report. That brings the year’s losses to 5.9 percent.
The global turmoil has tripped up the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, wiping out what little money they had made in 2018 -- a year that has seen managers including Highfields Capital’s Jon Jacobson and Tourbillon Capital’s Jason Karp exit the business. The losses also show the difficulties that most managers face in navigating episodic market turbulence. By contrast, macro managers sidestepped the mess and profited from price swings.
The selloff underscores the perils that funds face when they pile into the same stocks. Equity funds suffered after the top 10 stocks they’re most “crowded” in underperformed the S&P 500 Index by almost 3 percent on Oct. 29, the worst day since 2010,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. In addition, the top 10 stocks that funds bet against outperformed the index by more than 1 percent.
Funds that use computer-driven models to follow big market trends were whiplashed as price volatility spiked. Among the casualties: Leda Braga’s BlueTrend hedge fund, GAM Holding AG’s Cantab unit and Man Group Plc’s AHL unit. Other quant models that lost money include Renaissance Technologies’ U.S. equity fund.
On the macro front, managers who bet on broad economic trends have staged a comeback in 2018 after years of middling returns. Among them was Alan Howard’s Brevan Howard Asset Management which gained 1.9 percent through Oct. 26 in its main fund, bringing its returns so far this year to 12 percent.
Other hedge funds that skirted losses include Ken Griffin’s Citadel, which gained 0.5 percent so far this month in its biggest fund, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Representatives for the hedge funds declined to comment.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>",GM offers buyouts to cut costs after strong quarterly profit,"By Ben Klayman and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Wednesday stepped up efforts to cut costs in response to tariff and market pressures, even as it reported third-quarter profit that blew past Wall Street expectations.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said on Wednesday it is offering buyouts to salaried employees with 12 or more years of service, as Chief Executive Mary Barra told them in an email: ""Our structural costs are not aligned with the market realities."" 
GM shares jumped more than 8 percent to $36.34, their highest in almost six weeks. 
The Detroit automaker had previously promised investors it would cut $6.5 billion in costs this year, and the buyouts would add to that total, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
The company said in a separate statement that it would consider layoffs after it sees the impact of the buyouts and other cost cutting efforts. 
About 18,000 of the company's 50,000 salaried employees in North America are eligible for the buyouts, the company spokesman said. They do not affect the hourly workers on GM's production lines.
GM's move to cut staff stood in contrast to an upbeat profit outlook and its recent success in raising prices, which boosted profit before tax by $1 billion overall in the quarter, mostly in North America. 
In her email to employees, Barra focused on the fact that GM has burned through $300 million in cash in its automotive operations during the first nine months of 2018. She also noted that the company's stock price is still stuck near the $33 a share price at which it debuted in 2010 after a bankruptcy restructuring.
HIGHER MATERIALS COSTS 
For Detroit's automakers, rising materials costs caused by new tariffs on foreign metals imposed by the Trump administration are converging with a slowly deflating U.S. market and a sharper falloff in China, the world's largest auto market. 
GM and rivals  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) have all in recent weeks forecast substantial hits from steel and aluminum costs driven by tariffs. 
In the third quarter, GM said it was able to raise prices by $900 million in North America, in part because it is launching a new generation of its large pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Ford, however, has an older product line, and said its net pricing in North America fell by $318 million in the third quarter.
The pricing gains are ""absolutely sustainable,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said.
GM said it still sees a full-year profit in the range of $5.80 to $6.20 a share, but said it now expected to finish at the high end of the range with potential to finish even higher. It cited a favorable tax rate and its strong performance. Wall Street has been expecting $5.88 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
In July, GM lowered its full-year forecast, citing higher steel and aluminum costs due to tariffs.
The company said it still expects about $4 billion in free cash flow for the year before the impact of $600 million in pension contributions. 
Excluding the effect of any cost cutting it achieves, GM's Suryadevara reaffirmed GM's commodity costs in 2019 will increase by $1 billion over 2018. Ford has said it expects tariffs to reduce profits by $1 billion in 2018 and 2019, and Fiat Chrysler has warned rising metals costs could cost it 850 million euros ($963 million) this year and next year.
PRESSURE INCREASE 
The rise in materials costs is increasing pressure on automakers to cut costs ahead of a predicted decline in U.S. vehicle demand after an unusually long bull market. 
Earlier this month, Ford said it would cut its 70,000-strong global salaried workforce by an unspecified number and hoped to complete the cuts by the end of June 2019. This week, the No. 2 U.S. automaker is holding three days of meetings to discuss ways to flatten the structure of its salaried workforce and get managers to oversee larger numbers of employees.
GM has cut production at car plants over the last two years and its hourly workforce fell by 4,000 workers last year, according to GM's annual report. In addition, GM in June ended the second shift at its Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant, cutting 1,500 jobs.
In China, GM's largest market by vehicle sales, the automaker said it booked a record $500 million in income from its joint ventures. That result was in spite of the sharpest industry sales drop in nearly seven years during September.
The impact of the sales drop hit harder in China's interior, and demand remains strong in larger cities and for luxury vehicles, including GM's Cadillac models, Barra said on a conference call with analysts. 
GM reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year's quarter included a charge related to Europe.
Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 average analyst estimate, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected.8826 euros)

805,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>","Spruce Point sees dim future for Dollarama, share price drops","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Spruce Point Capital Management, which focuses on in-depth research of companies' vulnerabilities, sees room for Dollarama Inc's (TO:DOL) stock price to tumble roughly 40 percent after the Canadian retailer raised prices and fewer customers are shopping at its stores.
""Spruce Point believes Dollarama is a 'strong sell' with an approximately 40 percent downside risk,"" Ben Axler, who runs the hedge fund, said at an investment conference on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his presentation. He examined the company's products, pricing and what he called ""troublesome management and governance red flags.""
Axler presented the idea at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York and on Wednesday he released a report detailing the company's problems. 
""Dollarama is now a broken growth story that will fail to hit its lofty long-term growth targets,"" the report said, adding that the share price could drop to C$24.60 per share. It fell nearly 4 percent to trade at C$36.92 shortly after the open. 
Axler is one of a handful of so-called short activists, investment managers who often spend months researching a company and then publicize the information to convince others that the stock will fall a lot. Dollarama's stock price has already dropped 21 percent in the last six months.
Dollarama is no longer a true dollar store after a series of price hikes that have taken a bite out of store traffic, Axler said. 
Lyla Radmanovich, a Dollarama spokeswoman, said she was not aware of the presentation and declined to comment on ""speculation regarding our stock price."" 
Axler also pointed to what he called ""questionable accounting practices"" noting that the company made money through its currency hedges over the last years because sales are in Canadian dollars while most purchases are linked to the U.S. dollar. Those benefits have been erased, he said, but ""management reports that gross margins have effectively remained flat through this period.""
More competition, higher labor costs, rising transportation costs and the lapsing currency hedge benefit could all chip away at the company's profitability, he predicted.
Axler's brand of short activism has found favor with investors recently as his fund, which invests $169 million, returned 18 percent after fees so far this year, according to an investor note.

For funds that pursue this type of research-heavy shorting strategy, Axler said, recent market volatility is a plus. ""Investors are looking for differentiated research especially and they are now searching for uncorrelated investments.""

""We invested with Romspen because of their experienced executive team, acute focus on risk mitigation and strong track record of performance that is uncorrelated to public markets,"" TIG's president Spiros Maliagros said in a statement. No price was disclosed.
Romspen's management team, led by Mark Hilson and Wes Roitman, will continue to run the firm.
TIG, founded nearly 40 years ago by Carl Tiedemann, oversees roughly $3 billion in assets and plans on making more investments in other alternative managers. Sandler O'Neill was TIG's financial advisor.
Firms like Dyal Capital Partners, Affiliated Managers Group (N:AMG) and Blackstone Group (N:BX) have created lucrative businesses for themselves by buying minority stakes in investment firms at a time when the funds' founders may be looking to cash out or expand.
At the same time as TIG made its investment, Kudu Investment Management made an investment in TIG, whose size could not be obtained, that adds permanent and passive capital for TIG to expand and diversify.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",EU makes new offer to reluctant states on digital tax: document,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers will discuss next week a watered down proposal on an EU-wide digital tax, a document seen by Reuters shows, trying to persuade reticent governments to agree on the plan by the end of the year.
Under a proposal from the European Commission in March, EU states would charge a 3 percent levy on the digital turnover of large firms such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that are accused of routing their profits to the bloc's low-tax states.
While France and some other big EU states are pushing for a quick introduction of the tax, smaller countries such as Ireland or Luxembourg oppose the measure, fearing it could cut their tax revenues.
To overcome opposition, Austria, which holds the EU's presidency, has proposed to set a ""fixed expiry date"" on the tax, the document said.
The levy was always intended as a temporary solution on capturing revenues from digital companies which escape many taxes thanks to their cross-border and virtual business.
A ""sunset clause"" has already been backed by most of the 28 EU states, but has been so far linked to a global deal on tax reform. Under the Austrian proposal, the levy could end at a predefined date.
A lengthy global debate on the overhaul of digital taxation has produced no results as states tend to have different stances on the issue, and sometimes compete with each other on rates and other benefits to attract firms. 
Austria has also proposed excluding the sale of users' data from the activities covered by the planned tax, softening the Commission's proposal. Only revenues from online advertising services, in which Google and Facebook excel, and from virtual marketplaces, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), would be subject to the new tax under the plan.
EU finance ministers will discuss the Austrian ""options"" in their monthly meeting on Nov. 6 in Brussels.
EU DIVIDED
A third of EU states, including France, Italy and Spain, supported the Austrian plan in a meeting on Wednesday, diplomats told Reuters, calling for a deal by December. 
They pushed for an EU-wide deal because many states are planning to introduce similar national levies which could fragment the EU's common market. Britain, which will leave the bloc in March, announced its plan to tax online platforms on Tuesday.
But a large number of states, including Germany, Sweden, Ireland and Malta, raised objections, diplomats said. All EU states must back the plan for the tax to be introduced.
After initially backing the plan, Berlin has grown more skeptical, fearing that Washington will retaliate on the tax, which would hit mostly U.S. tech giants.
""A tax should be based on income, not sales, and should not single out a specific industry for taxation under a different standard,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, urging a global solution instead of ""unilateral action"". 
Echoing U.S. concerns, Nordic EU countries have expressed concerns the tax could damage the bloc's competitiveness as it would be imposed on revenues rather than profits, which is the traditional way of taxing companies.

Other legal and technical issues have also been raised by some states in an attempt to derail the plan, diplomats said.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","Taco Bell, KFC power Yum Brands quarterly results","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit on Wednesday, as strong sales at KFC and Taco Bell more than made up for further weakness at Pizza Hut, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent.
Competition between big U.S. fast food chains has intensified as Yum, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) try to lure cash conscious customers with dollar menus, discounts and new breakfast items.
To grab market share, Yum launched several value meal offers this year that included Taco Bell's $1 nacho fries and a $1 Triple Melt burritos as well as KFC's ""$20 Fill Up"" meal.
The efforts helped the company register better-than-expected growth in same-store sales at both the chains. 
""Taco Bell is just doing everything really well,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said. ""The value price points are spot on."" 
Same-restaurant sale at Taco Bell rose 5 percent. KFC, best known for its crispy fried chicken, reported a 3 percent rise.
Pizza Hut, however, remained a dark spot, with same-restaurant sales falling 1 percent, due to declines in the United States, where it faces slowing demand.
The chain has been trying to turn itself around in its home market, ramping up promotional offerings such as the large two-topping pizza for $5.99. 
But that has so far done little for the chain, which continues to lose customers to Domino's, meal-kit companies and grocery stores that sell prepared food.
""One of the big issues for Pizza Hut is that among younger age segments – especially students – it plays third fiddle behind Domino's and even troubled Papa John's,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail said.
Pizza Hut's weak performance also undermined expectations that it would benefit most from struggles at Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) in the wake of an acrimonious split with its founder.
Company executives also called out Pizza Hut's underperformance on a post-earnings call, with Creed saying the promotions were not distinctive enough to attract new customers.
Overall, revenue fell 3 percent to $1.39 billion, but beat analysts' average estimate.
Excluding one-time items, Yum earned $1.04 per share, beating analysts' average expectation of 83 cents, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Yum's net income rose 8.6 percent to $454 million in the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company's shares were up nearly 4.5 percent at $90.35, adding to its gains of 6 percent this year.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks have lost nearly 40 billion euros ($45 billion) of market capitalization since May, with small and mid-sized lenders worst-hit by a sell-off on concerns that Rome's budget crisis will lead to a capital crunch in the third-largest euro zone economy.
Faced with the government's unwillingness to accommodate European Union demands for fiscal discipline, investors have been dumping Italian government bonds, which account for about 10 percent of Italian banks' total assets. That has forced lenders into costly write-downs, lifted funding costs and darkened their profit outlook. 
The hefty loss in market capitalization comes as the euro zone banking watchdog releases results of its latest stress test of European lenders, with Italian banks under the greatest scrutiny.
The impact on their results has been manageable so far but markets look to be anticipating even more pain ahead, with investors considering scenarios in which bond prices fall to levels last seen during the euro zone debt crisis of 2009-2011. 
Thibault Douard, who helps manage around 14 billion euros of assets at Tikehau Capital, said a further 200-300 basis point widening in government bond spreads would be problematic for some weaker banks. 
GRAPHIC: Market cap loss - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P24xEz
CHEAP BUT NOT DISTRESSED
Italy's banking index has lost as much as 37 percent since May and its banks are now priced at less than 0.6 times book value, bringing the discount to euro zone peers to 12 percent, the widest in nearly two years. Earlier this year they were priced at nearly 0.9 times.
Analysts say the cheap valuations reflect risks of possible capital increases. State-controlled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) and Milan-based Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) trade below 0.2 times and top lenders  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stand at around 0.6 and 0.5 times respectively.
On the earnings front there has been no relief either, with Italian banks suffering 23 consecutive weeks of earnings downgrades.
Against this backdrop, traders say a budget compromise with the EU could bring some relief, but further turmoil could smash valuations to the distressed levels hit during the debt crisis.
""Italian banks look attractive at current valuations, but amidst continued volatility we think the risk will remain on the downside,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Carlo Tommaselli.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>","Barrick, Randgold sweeten dividend ahead of takeover deal vote","By Zandi Shabalala and Susan Taylor
LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold and takeover target  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) are boosting their dividend payouts ahead of shareholder votes next week on their $6.1 billion deal, the miners said Wednesday. 
Barrick's all-stock purchase of the African miner, announced in September, spurred some analyst criticism because it lacked a premium for Randgold, which has a record of strong operational and financial performance.
Randgold plans to sweeten its 2018 dividend by 35 percent, to $2.69 per share from $2, and pay it before the merger closes, Barrick said in a statement.
The boost reflects Randgold's financial performance year-to-date and dividend policy, Barrick added.
Scotiabank analyst Tanya Jakusconek said she was unsurprised by the boost, because the reduced dividend outlook was a key concern of Randgold shareholders, but noted the increase is essentially ""just a minor tweak.""
While Randgold requires 75 percent of votes in support of the deal, Jakusconek said in a note to clients that she expects the transaction to proceed, citing the companies' share outperformance, tight trading spread and positive recommendations from leading proxy advisory firms.
Randgold shares have gained some 26 percent since the Sept. 24 announcement of the deal, with Barrick shares adding about 24 percent.
Randgold has steadily increased its dividend over the years, generating cash by operating its African gold mines cheaply, while rivals struggled with big debts taken on to fund acquisitions and expansion.
""I assume it followed pushback from Randgold investors, who had been looking for sweeter dividends in light of (Randgold CEO) Mark Bristow's pledge to return all cash above $500 million, barring new project development,"" Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat said.
Barrick now aims for a fourth-quarter dividend of 7 cents a share, up from 5 cents, and a 2018 dividend of 16 cents. The increase will cost about $65 million, Barrick said.
The Toronto-based company said it will target an ongoing annual payout of 16 cents, up from 12 cents, based on its ""strong fundamentals"" and merger benefits including additional overhead savings, lower costs and potential asset sales.
Barrick would not detail any expected financial benefits from the merger.
The sector's biggest transaction in years is seen closing in the first quarter of 2019. Barrick shareholders vote on Nov. 5 and Randgold investors on Nov. 7.

The move by Vietnam's biggest bank by market value comes as diplomatic ties between Communist Vietnam and former war enemy United States are on the rise and is part of a push to expand internationally as it aims for a place among the world's top 300 banking and financial groups.
Vietcombank has obtained approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve and an agreement in principle from the New York State Department of Financial Services to open a representative office in New York City, it said on its website.
The State Bank of Vietnam, the country's central bank, owns 77 percent of Vietcombank. Japan's Mizuho Bank [MZFGAE.UL] is the second biggest investor with a 15 percent stake.
""As Vietnam becomes more attractive to U.S. investors, Vietcombank's representative office ... will be an extended arm for Vietcombank in the United States to support business development in this very potential market,"" it said, adding that it aims to obtain a license and open a New York office as soon as possible.
The representative office would liaise with prospective clients and banks in the United States and engage in other non-transactional activities such as analysis of the banking and financial services market.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: German firms urged to cut dependence on China,"By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - A new strategy paper from Germany's influential BDI industry federation calls on firms to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market, according to a draft seen by Reuters, in a sign of rising concern over Beijing's state-driven economic model.
The 25-page China position paper from the Federation of German Industries (BDI), which is due to be published in January, argues that a long-promised opening of the Chinese market is unlikely to take place and voices concern about rising Communist party control over society and the economy.
Entitled ""Partner and Systemic Competitor - How to cope with China's state-driven economic model?"", the paper makes clear that German firms cannot afford to turn their backs on China.
But, in an unusual step, it urges them to reassess their presence there, while offering numerous recommendations for the German government and European Union.
The BDI is Germany's main business lobby group and although its proposals do not always translate directly into policy, they carry significant weight.
""Despite the attractiveness of the Chinese market, it will be increasingly important for companies to closely examine the risks of their engagement in China and to minimize their dependence by diversifying supply chains, production sites and sales markets,"" reads the draft, which is being vetted by BDI members and could change before publication.
A spokesman for the BDI later confirmed that the group was working on a China paper but said it was still at an early stage.
Bilateral trade between Germany and China hit a record 188 billion euros last year. And big German firms, notably carmakers like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG), depend heavily on the fast-growing Chinese market.
But while their presence there was once seen as a strength, it is now unsettling German politicians and industry as Beijing asserts control over the economy under President Xi Jinping.
Scepticism is growing despite recent steps by China to open up its economy, including allowing Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn) to invest in a major chemical site and BMW to take control of its main joint venture in China, a first for a foreign carmaker.
Another worry is the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, which risks putting Germany - and Europe - in the awkward position of having to choose between its top two economic partners.
RANGE OF PROBLEMS
The paper cites a range of problems for German firms operating in China, from forced technology transfer and failures to protect intellectual property to arbitrary customs decisions and unequal access to licenses and financing.
It calls for closer coordination on China strategy within the German government and between the EU and like-minded partners, including the United States.
It also argues for a new EU instrument to prevent state-subsidized takeovers, including requiring Chinese firms to present accounts based on internationally agreed standards when acquiring European firms so their ownership structures and financing can be vetted.
The BDI calls on the EU to develop its own ambitious industrial strategy for 2030, an echo of Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which prioritizes development of key industry sectors, from robotics and aerospace to clean-energy cars.
It argues for a bigger EU budget - including a doubling of R&D spending - to support investments in infrastructure, education and innovation.
""We are facing a systemic competition between our open markets approach and China's state-driven economic model,"" the paper reads. ""We need a broad discussion across politics, society and industry about this challenge.""
Responding to the story, Volker Treier, foreign trade chief at the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHK), warned against putting forward any strategy that ""pushes China into a corner"".
The BDI makes clear in the paper that Germany industry has no interest in ""fencing in"" China. But it also supports a firm response to China's attempts to reshape the liberal global order.
It describes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xi's ambitious plan to connect China to Europe, Africa and beyond via transport links and trade deals, as an attempt by Beijing to build geopolitical influence and shape third markets according to its own interests.

To counter this influence, the BDI calls for a ""diplomatic offensive"" from Berlin and Brussels toward countries in eastern Europe, central Asia, southeast Asia and Africa.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>","Sprint beats revenue and profit forecasts, shares rise","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) beat Wall Street's estimates for quarterly revenue, profit and overall net subscriber additions on Wednesday, driving shares in the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier 9 percent higher in morning trading.
Sprint, which is awaiting regulatory approval to merge with bigger rival T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), focused on increasing its revenue from devices such as tablets and smartwatches, and getting more customers for its higher-priced unlimited phone plans, Chief Executive Michel Combes said during an earnings call with analysts.
As customers add more devices other than phones, ""it should reduce churn at the end of the day, because that means more devices per account,"" Combes said. 
Sprint reported net income attributable to the company of $196 million, or 5 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a net loss of $48 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier.
Analysts were expecting the company to report a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Sprint's business seems to be stabilizing, Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with NewStreet Research, said in a note, adding ""if the deal [with T-Mobile] is approved, it will be far easier to integrate a business that is stable.""
Sprint added a net 109,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the second quarter, down from 168,000 new subscribers at the same time last year. 
Analysts on average had expected the company to lose a net 10,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. 
In July, Sprint revamped its unlimited wireless plans to include a basic and premium plan. Combes previously said the higher prices for those plans could affect future customer additions, as the carrier tries to balance growth with profitability. 
Sprint fell short of estimates for it to add 22,000 net phone subscribers, instead losing 34,000 in the quarter as it battles the negative perception of its network quality compared to AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ). 
Churn, or the rate of customer defections, among phone customers who pay a recurring bill, was 1.73 percent during the quarter, up from 1.59 percent in the same period last year.
Combes said Sprint expected the churn level to continue over the next several quarters, as customers who were on promotional pricing plans could leave after the offer ends. 

Total operating revenue rose to $8.43 billion from $7.93 billion. Analysts had expected the company to report revenue of $7.97 billion.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",European banks braced for fallout from EU stress tests,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Italian banks are expected to be in focus again when results of the latest stress test of top European lenders are released this week, a health check that could force laggards to raise capital or ditch assets.
The closely watched test of 48 banks across the European Union will be published by the European Banking Authority (EBA), the bloc's banking watchdog, at 1700 GMT on Friday.
It is being touted as EBA's toughest test since the exercise was introduced in 2009 to identify any capital holes and ensure taxpayer rescues like those seen during the financial crisis a decade ago are not needed in future.
The performance of Germany's biggest lender,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), will also be scrutinized as it seeks to regain its footing after three years of losses.
The tests measure the ability of banks to withstand theoretical market shocks like a disorderly Brexit, a sell-off in government bonds and property, or a rise in political uncertainty against a backdrop of falling economic growth.
Supervisors will use the results to determine how much capital lenders should be holding or which risky assets should be sold over the coming year to lessen the need for capital.
While there is no formal pass/fail mark, investors will check how much core capital lenders hold against a threshold of 5.5 percent under the test's toughest ""adverse"" scenario.
No bank is expected to fall below the 5.5 percent mark, but banks that are too close may come under market pressure.
""The stress test results might lead banks to issue more capital,"" rating agency DBRS said in a note on Wednesday.
ITALIAN WOES
Thirty-three of the banks covered by the test are in the euro zone, where the European Central Bank is their main supervisor.
Italian lender Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) performed worst in the last test in 2016 and has since been bailed out by the state, but it, along with lenders from weaker banking systems like Greece and Portugal, are not included in the EBA tests.
The ECB is separately testing a further 60 smaller banks, some of which are struggling, but will not be publishing the results.
The health check could heighten market concerns over Italian banks which have come under pressure because of the falling value of their large holdings of Italian debt since an anti-establishment, eurosceptic coalition took power in June. [nL8N1WH52F][nL8N1XB53X]
Italy's Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) could suffer higher market volatility because it has a thinner capital buffer than its domestic rivals, analysts said.
The spike in Italian sovereign bond yields since May has hurt the country's banks by increasing funding costs and eroding the value of their vast bond holdings. The yield recently reached a level that is not far from the worst-case scenario assumed in the EBA exercise.
Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, said he expected the result for Deutsche Bank to be ""pretty similar"" to that in 2016, with the bank's improved capital ratio to be offset by a harsher adverse scenario.
A new element in this year's test is the inclusion of a new accounting rule known as IFRS 9 that forces banks to make provisions much earlier for souring loans than in the past.
The test focuses on capital levels, but European banks continue to lag their U.S. counterparts in terms of profitability, quality of loans and cost discipline.
The European banking index (SX7P) has lost more than 20 percent so far this year amid concerns over slowing economic growth, weak revenues and stubbornly high costs.
""From investors' perspective, the results of the test will not shed any additional light on a sector that requires to transform itself dramatically and become much more profitable,"" said Fernando de la Mora, a consultant at Alvarez & Marsal.

Following a mixed third-quarter earnings report, shares of the social network are climbing the most in six months, up 6 percent in early trading Wednesday.
While Wall Street has sounded off on its confidence in the tech giant’s ability to scale, reductions to price targets from Facebook’s biggest bulls reveal some level of concern as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg begins to pivot away from a feed-centric platform. At least four analysts have slashed their price targets by $30 or more.
Here’s what Wall Street is saying:
RBC Capital, Mark Mahaney
Fundamentals for Facebook in the third quarter weakened, with revenue growth decelerating and operating margin decline.
Still, Facebook has ""arguably the best risk-reward in large cap Internet, in our view,"" writes Mahaney in a note to clients. The firm remains bullish given that Facebook still owns two of the largest media and messaging assets in the world.
Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still have material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization.
Reiterates outperform rating but lowers estimates and price target to $190 from $225.
Cowen, John Blackledge
In-line results and more clarity on 2019 should offer some relief, Cowen tells clients.
Advertising pricing growth decelerated as impression growth is increasingly coming from ad units like Instagram Stories and developing markets that monetize at lower rates.
Maintains outperform, lowers price target to $195 from $200
Susquehanna, Shyam Patil
""2019 should see bottoming out for margins and pace of revenue growth decel,"" Patil writes in a note to clients. ""We are buyers.""
Facebook ""also seems to be incrementally more confident in its ability to monetize Stories and execute on the longer-term growth opportunities. We believe this is positive news for the stock, as uncertainty around the forward growth and margins had driven the valuation"" less than 11 times 2019 Ebitda.
Maintains positive rating, cuts price target to $220 from $250
Nomura, Mark Kelley
Facebook’s third-quarter report ""was a bit of a mixed bag"" with a lighter top-line and user metrics offset by better margins and lighter operating expense growth versus expectations.
""The revenue trajectory from here seems to depend on how effectively the company is able to switch from a feed-centric platform to Stories as the primary driver."" A process in which management noted will take some time.
Remains neutral, slashes price target to $161 form $183
JPMorgan, Douglas Anmuth
The firm is more positive on Facebook coming off of its third-quarter earnings report, adding it once again to the J.P. Morgan US Equity Analyst Focus List as a value pick.
""Expectations are lower as the shares have become more washed out over the past few months.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) believes the revenue deceleration is manageable, particularly as Facebook continues to improve advertising products and drive strong return on investment, and as marketers do not have good alternatives to the social platform’s scale & returns.
While concerns will remain around engagement and shifting social behavior, Anmuth views the more than 2 billion user base as stickier than many believe. And Facebook is both adapting to and shaping user behavior.
Maintains overweight rating with $195 price target.
Raymond James, Aaron Kessler
Facebook reported relatively in-line revenues for the third quarter, ""which were likely better than feared,"" and positively revised its fourth-quarter revenue deceleration expectation.
Facebook Family of Services (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger) increased users to 2.6 billion versus 2.5 billion last quarter, and more than 2 billion people use at least one of its Family of Services daily on average.
Retains outperform rating, cuts price target to $180 from $210
JMP Securities, Ronald Josey
""While we acknowledge the impact to profitability from the investments around Stories, Video, and security, among others, we also think there is the potential for significant ROI over the next 1-2 years as a result of these investments.""
Investments in Facebook’s family of applications ""can revamp user growth, improve engagement, and potentially accelerate ad revenue as users increasingly gravitate to Stories, watch video, and communicate via private messages when using online social platforms.""
Outperform, lowers price target to $176 from $206
Pivotal Research, Brian Wieser
""As before, we continue to view the long-run revenue opportunities for Facebook more negatively than much of the investment community does because we see limits to growth for the overall advertising industry.""
""Facebook’s budgets won’t be meaningfully altered by the establishment of new ad products for Stories, unless they appeal to advertisers the company doesn’t already serve comprehensively.""
""Comments on platform security did little to persuade us that the company has a handle on the operational problems it faces.""
Sell rating, reduces price target to $125 from $131

825,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",European funds swoop on stocks amid sell-off,"By Sujata Rao and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European fund managers have used this month's decline in global stock markets to bump up their equity exposure to the highest since January, though bond holdings have waned and Italy remains a serious concern.
The Reuters monthly asset allocation poll of 16 European asset managers was conducted between Oct. 16-30, when world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) were seeing their worst rout since the mid-2012 peak of the euro zone crisis. 
The regions in vogue this month include Latin America, where conservative Jair Bolsonaro has been elected in Brazil and Argentina has landed a new International Monetary Fund support deal. Europeans funds have bought in the euro zone, too.
In contrast, U.S., UK and emerging-market Asian stocks were all trimmed as investors eyed a variety of risks, not least the U.S.-China trade war, stuttering Brexit negotiations, stretched prices and rising global interest rates.
U.S. equity holdings fell over 2 percentage points to 42.1 percent which marks a four-month low. UK equity exposure dropped to the lowest since March 2017 at 5.1 percent. 
Continental European poll participants who answered a question on whether the Britain's pound would be stronger or weaker after next March's Brexit deadline were evenly split in their views. 
Italy concerns are clearly raw as its populist coalition government confronts the European Commission over its budget spending plans. 
Seven of the nine fund managers who answered thought the closely watched premium between triple A-rated German government bonds and Italy government debt, the yield spread, could still get wider. 
""We don’t see a stable situation yet,"" said Amundi Group Chief Investment Officer Pascal Blanqué. ""More steps are probably needed in order to reach a compromise with the EU commission. Volatility is here to stay in Italian spreads.""
Overall levels of euro zone bond holdings have also been pruned this month to just about 50 percent. But with signs that U.S. interest rates will keep nudging up, U.S. and Canadian holdings have fallen the most, at close to 2 percentage points, to 28.5 percent. 
""The recent market correction seems excessive, for equities in particular,"" said Julien Servit at Prime Partners. 

""The sentiment has dramatically changed in a matter of two months without concrete facts justifying it. The correction could offer an opportunity,"" he added.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","UK funds shift into bonds, snap up U.S. stocks","By Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - British investors increased their fixed-income holdings and cut back their stock exposure in October, although they took a shine to North American companies within their equity allocations.
Across global balanced portfolio strategies, exposure to bonds rose to 28.2 percent in October from 26.8 percent in September, reaching their highest level in a year, according to Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 13 UK-based asset managers, conducted between Oct 15-30.
The gains came at the expense of equity allocations, which declined to 50.2 percent from 52.0 percent. Cash holdings slipped to 4.1 percent from 5.1 percent.
""We prefer credit over equities given where we are in this cycle; it is mature and we don't see explosive upside from stocks,"" said Thomas Becket at Psigma.
Within their equity holdings, UK fund managers raised their exposure to U.S. equities to 38.5 percent from 35.3 percent in September. That is in line with a wider trend among portfolio managers around the globe, who seem unfazed by the sell-off that ripped through equity markets in October.
""The buoyancy of the U.S. economy and the strength of company profits will eventually provide a floor,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Above-average cash levels already pointed to a high level of caution among investors and this - in combination with renewed share buy-backs - would help support the market, added Milligan.
Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, predicted the bull run for U.S. stocks was not over yet, despite some choppy waters ahead.
""Cross-currents in the world economy are causing volatility again this October, but we are buying the dip in the equity markets on the basis that we expect the economic expansion and bull market to continue into 2019,"" Greetham said.
The increasing exposure to U.S. stocks has come at the expense of a number of emerging markets. UK fund managers reduced equity holdings across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and emerging Europe, the poll showed.
Roiled by the crisis in Turkey and Argentina and by harsh pressure on many emerging-market currencies elsewhere, developing-market stocks (MSCIEF) have tumbled some 27 percent since their peak in late January.
UK fund managers were more optimistic than those elsewhere that the British pound <GBP=> would be stronger on March 29, 2019, when Britain is no longer a member of the European Union. Only half as many respondents expect sterling to fall below 1.31 to the dollar as expect it to strengthen beyond that.
""The fourth quarter will be key for the Brexit negotiations and the future direction for sterling,"" said Christopher Peel at Tavistock Investment Management. ""The time for posturing is over and both sides appear to be showing a newfound willingness to compromise.""
However, many declined to make the call, given the uncertainties faced by markets.
""Even if the current UK government's proposals are agreed by the EU-27 without further amendment, the political blowback is likely to be severe, with the very real possibility of the government falling, or at the very least seeing a leadership change,"" said Michael Ingram at WHIreland.

(Reuters) - U.S. global fund managers made no significant changes to their recommended model portfolio in October, still preferring to hold North American assets but with a slightly larger cash buffer, a Reuters poll showed.
Equity allocations accounted for an average 56.7 percent of the global portfolio, essentially unchanged from 56.6 percent in September. Bonds were also static, at 35.5 percent, according to the Oct. 17-30 survey of 12 U.S. fund managers.
For the third month in a row, the notable change was a recommended increase in cash holdings, now up to 5.3 percent, the highest in over a decade.
Recommendations for allocations to North American stocks were also increased to the highest in two years, at the expense of euro zone and emerging market equities. Those findings are based on a smaller sub-set of respondents.
The cash holdings suggest even long-term investors are getting more defensive in the midst of market turmoil. The S&P 500 (SPX) is headed for its biggest monthly percentage drop in more than eight years and the broad world stocks index (MIWD00000PUS) losing about $4 trillion in value in October.
""The combination of aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes, an escalating and potentially prolonged trade dispute with China and the upcoming mid-term elections has generated a great deal of anxiety for the markets,"" said Alan Gayle, president of Via Nova Investment Management. ""Fear and uncertainty are currently dominating market psychology.""
""We continue to favor the U.S. market over the international space, because of its higher earnings and revenue growth relative to the rest of the world. Moreover, despite the recent weakness in the U.S. markets, the domestic space has been a relative safe haven in a challenging market.""

A special committee formed by Papa John’s board of directors is exploring a sale as part of a wide review of strategic alternatives, and there is no certainty that the company will agree to a sale, the sources added.
No matter who buys Papa John's, investors care most about what the pizza chain might be worth in the event of an acquisition.

835,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",'Red October' sees US stocks endure their worst month since the financial crisis,"Stocks are set to end October having endured the worst month for the S&P 500 since February 2009 and the worst October since the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmark US index is set to drop about 8.5%, outdone by the 16.8% loss the index witnessed in 2008 just weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The month was plagued by bad news but lacked a clear catalyst. Concerns as varied as a US-China trade war, the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy, and a slowdown in global growth led to a wave of heavy selling in the S&P as well as in the Dow and the Nasdaq.
October selling was not limited to the US, with Chinese stocks plummeting and the MSCI All-World index dropping about 10%.
In the US in particular, the biggest concern for investors is that after years of monetary stimulus and a short-term boost from the Trump administration's tax cuts, more interest-rate increases and lower bond prices will ultimately bring the US economy to a halt.
 Growth is still going strong, but many believe that will flip soon, particularly when factoring in the potential negative impact of President Donald Trump's trade war, which by some measures is already starting to hurt the domestic economy.
Another factor for the markets is the slowing Chinese economy, which after a decade or more of blockbuster growth is reaching maturity, bringing with it smaller increases in gross domestic product.  Debt levels in China are also huge, another major concern for many in the markets.
China's account balance is down significantly from last year's 1.3% and is likely to turn into a small deficit in 2019. If so, that would be the first time in 24 years.
""The larger the stimulus used by China to offset the trade-war impact, the bigger will its deficit likely be,"" Tao Wang, UBS' chief China economist, said in a report earlier in the month.
That may hurt confidence and hasten outflows, putting pressure on the nation's currency.
""Although CNY depreciation can partially offset trade war impact, a large depreciation will likely hurt domestic confidence, trigger panic outflows and risk financial stability,"" UBS said, using the abbreviation for the Chinese yuan.
The tail end of October has seen an additional negative driver, particularly for the Nasdaq, as disappointing earnings reports from the US tech giants  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and  Snap helped to further drag down sentiment.
Oil prices are also a major concern, with the combination of looming sanctions against Iran, and the possibility that Saudi Arabia will choke output in response to international outcry over the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country's consulate in Istanbul, leading some to believe prices could ratchet higher in coming months.
High oil prices tend to stunt economic growth, particularly in developing markets where increasing oil consumption is a key driver of rapid growth. Brent traded as high as $84 a barrel in early October, and while it has now fallen about 9% to $76 a barrel, that remains an elevated level compared with the past four years.
Though stocks have witnessed a horror month, they seemed likely to bounce a little on October's final day, with the S&P 500 set to gain about 0.7% once markets open at 9:30 a.m. in New York."

DUBAI (Reuters) - China's Belt and Road Initiative and plans by Gulf economies to diversify from oil will help HSBC (L:HSBA) to more than double its profit within its commercial bank in the Middle East and North Africa, a senior bank executive said.
""You have probably two of the biggest infrastructure programs ever undertaken: the Middle East transformation programs and the Belt and Road Initiative. We are in many of the countries where this is being undertaken, so we are at the heart of it,"" Daniel Howlett, HSBC regional head of commercial banking in Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENA), told Reuters.
The commercial bank, which includes trade finance, cash management and capital financing, reported profit of $199 million in MENA in 2017 and profit of $6.8 billion for the commercial bank globally.
""Within the commercial bank, I believe we can more than double [profit] in the next five years in this region,"" he said.
The commercial bank's Middle East pipeline was better than ever, Howlett said, with clients looking for financing for cross-border mergers and acquisitions, projects, trade services, lending and other products.
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar are among governments pushing ahead with plans to move their economies away from a dependence on oil revenues.
HSBC was seeking new business related to those transformation plans in sectors such as education, professional services, infrastructure, healthcare and private equity, he said, highlighting UAE, Egypt and Kuwait as stand out markets for growth.
Asked if HSBC's appetite for doing business with Saudi Arabia had changed as a result of the international uproar surrounding the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Howlett said HSBC was committed to the country.
""We have a long-term, strategic commitment to the region. Saudi Arabia is a G20 member and an important part of that and we have a duty to serve our clients wherever they may operate,"" he said.
Although the business stemming from China's Belt and Road Imitative in the region was relatively ""nascent"" so far, HSBC expects to benefit from an estimated $2 trillion China plans to spend on the scheme globally over the next 15 to 20 years, he said.
The project, unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:48AM ET</span>",Anthem profit beats as insurer reins in costs,"(Reuters) - Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) reported quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, helped by lower costs at its commercial insurance business and the company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast.
The insurer's benefit expense ratio - an insurer's spending on claims against the premiums it earns - narrowly missed the consensus estimate of 84.7 percent by brokerage Evercore ISI. 
However, the ratio improved to 84.8 percent in the quarter from 87 percent in the year-ago period. 
Anthem said it now expects the ratio for the full year to be around 84.2 percent, an improvement from its prior forecast of 84.4 percent.
Evercore analyst Michael Newshel said in a note that any worries about the small miss in ratio for the quarter could be tempered by the lowered forecast for benefit expense. 
As the health insurance industry doubles down on ways to tighten spending, Anthem's rivals  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) and  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) have separately signed multi-billion dollar deals to merge with pharmacy benefit managers.
However, Anthem has decided to take its pharmacy benefits business in-house in 2020, when it will start managing billions of dollars of patient prescriptions in a bid to cut costs. 
In the third quarter, total membership fell by 753,000 members from 40.3 million members in the year-ago period, as the company continues to exit its Obamacare business and lost out on members buying its Medicaid health plans for low-income members.
However, membership in its Medicare business, which caters to the elderly and people with disabilities, rose nearly 18 percent to 1.77 million from a year earlier, boosted by Anthem's acquisitions of health insurers HealthSun and America's 1st Choice. 
Anthem said it now expected full-year adjusted earnings forecast to be more than $15.60 per share, up from the prior forecast of over $15.40 per share. 
Net income rose to $960 million, or $3.62 per share, in the third quarter ended September 30. Excluding items, the company earned $3.81 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.70 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Total revenue rose 3.7 percent to $23.25 billion, beating the analyst average estimate of $22.94 billion.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:48AM ET</span>",Shares bounce as bulls fight back after brutal October,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets bounced on Wednesday, bringing some relief after a brutal October in which equities have suffered one of their worst drops in a decade and spooked investors.
Sino-U.S. trade tensions, concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates and fears that corporate earnings' growth is peaking have combined to shake financial markets this month, leaving most major markets in negative territory for the year.
That has spurred predictions that an almost decade-long bull-market has run its course.
Data overnight showing that China's factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years has reinforced worries about weakening growth stemming from the trade conflict with the United States. That followed disappointing euro zone growth data published on Tuesday.
Investors rushed into the dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan languished at a 22-month low. 
A batch of positive earnings set a firmer tone for European stocks on Wednesday, though pan-European indexes are still headed for their weakest month since August 2015.
The leading euro zone stock index was up 1.7 percent in early trading, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.7 percent and Germany's DAX up 1.5 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 increased 1.6 percent.
They tracked gains in Asia, where the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, bringing month-to-date losses to 10.6 percent. 
Wall Street was indicated higher at the open, with the S&P 500 e-mini futures 0.7 percent ahead.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.6 percent but remains down 8.2 percent in October, its worst month since 2012. 
The index is down 13 percent from all-time highs hit in January.
""Ultimately I'm still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.
""I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.""
Concerns over growth in Asia and the euro zone come as the U.S. economy continues to look in healthier shape, spurring fresh demand for the dollar.
DOLLAR DOMINATES, YUAN SAGS
The greenback, measured against a basket of currencies, scaled a 2018 peak, while the euro nudged up slightly to $1.1350 after data showed euro zone inflation picking up in October. 
""Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,"" said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London. 
China's offshore yuan fell to a 22-month low of 6.9795. In onshore markets it was flat at 6.9673 per dollar but remained near a decade low brushed on Tuesday.
The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly loss, the longest such losing streak on record.
The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent while the Japanese yen was flat at 113.12 versus the dollar, a three-week low.
The recovery in global stocks, including gains overnight on Wall Street, pushed Treasury yields higher. The 10-year U.S. bonds rose three basis points to 3.1397 percent.
Oil prices recovered as markets braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran next week. 
U.S. crude futures rose half a percent to $66.49 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, the lowest since mid-August.
Brent crude gained more than one percent to $76.75 before settling half a percent up at $76.29. Brent had declined 1.8 percent on Tuesday to two-month lows.
Gold, set for its best month since January, dipped on the stronger dollar, Spot gold prices were down 0.4 percent at $1,217 an ounce.

The largest U.S. automaker earned $1.87 a share on revenue of $35.8 billion in the June-Sept. period. Analysts expected the automaker to bring in a profit of $1.24 a share. The revenue target was $35.3 billion.
The solid third-quarter performance reflected profitability in all core operating segments. Strong results in North America were driven by all-new full-size trucks, and crossovers. GM China equity income and GM Financial EBT were third-quarter records.
""Our third-quarter performance demonstrates our determination to manage risks and deliver strong business results,"" GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement.
GM also said its full-year earnings outlook would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America.
The Detroit automaker said it still sees a full-year profit in the range of $5.80 to $6.20 a share, but said it now expected to finish at the high end of the range with potential to finish even higher. It cited a favorable tax rate and its strong performance.
Following the release of the report, GM shares jumped around 10% in pre-market trade to $36.90.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's (T:7267) joint venture with GAC Group (SS:601238) (HK:2238) will invest 3.27 billion yuan ($469 million) in new-energy vehicle production in China, GAC said in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday.
The move is part of Honda and GAC's push to meet China’s stringent green car quotas. 
The Honda-GAC joint venture will build a new plant with capacity to produce 170,000 new-energy vehicles a year, the filing said. New-energy vehicles include all electric battery cars as well as plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
A source close to the joint venture said that the plan envisages Japan's Honda producing GAC's Trumpchi GS4, a battery powered compact SUV, to sell through Honda outlets operated with GAC. 
The Honda-produced car is likely to be sold with the Trumpchi badge rather than Honda's, the source said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the matter.
It is a highly unusual arrangement but provides a quick way to meet Beijing’s requirements for such vehicles to represent 10 percent of an auto manufacturer’s production by 2019.
The deal is similar to an earlier one between Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and its local partner. Toyota showrooms will sell an electric vehicle without the Japanese company’s distinctive triple-oval logo. Instead, it will feature the label of its Chinese partner GAC and be built using GAC’s lower-cost technology.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",Airbus says tougher to meet jet delivery goal after snags,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus softened its key target for jet deliveries on Wednesday and warned that reaching it would be a ""greater stretch"" after a sequence of industrial problems.
The cautious tone on deliveries - which implied a 2 percent cut in the annual target by changing its parameters to include a recently acquired Canadian jet - came despite higher than expected third-quarter core earnings and strong demand from airlines.
The maker of jetliners, satellites and helicopters said it had made an adjusted operating profit of 1.576 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the quarter on revenues of 15.451 billion.
Analysts on average expected third-quarter adjusted operating profit of 1.441 billion euros on sales of 15.316 billion, according to a Reuters poll. 
Airbus shares rose 0.3 percent to 94.21 euros.
The company has been struggling with fresh industrial problems as production of its fast-selling A321neo passenger jet hit a snag in Hamburg, Germany, even as bottlenecks eased at some engine makers.
The problems with the A321neo, a model central to Airbus's ambition to dominate the top end of the single-aisle market and
thwart Boeing's plans for a new mid-sized passenger jet, were first reported by Reuters.
""A lot remains to be done before the end of the year to fulfill commitments,"" Airbus said in a statement.
Airbus stuck to its headline target of around 800 commercial deliveries in 2018 but disclosed this now included 18 deliveries of the Bombardier CSeries jet, renamed A220. 
Delegates at a Hong Kong gathering this week had warned that Airbus faced a challenge to meet the crucial goal.
Airbus also trimmed its cashflow target for the year.
INDUSTRIAL CHALLENGES
Delays in supplies of engines for medium-haul jets from Pratt & Whitney and French-U.S. supplier CFM International are receding but Britain's Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) last week cut the number of engines it plans to deliver for the wide-body Airbus A330neo this year.
""We have engines and we have the airframes but the whole industrial planning had to be reshuffled time and again ... next to some industrial challenges on our own operation,"" Finance Director Harald Wilhelm told analysts.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) too has suffered industrial problems, but the world's largest planemaker last week reported stronger-than-expected profits, reflecting continued strong airliner demand.
The commercial aerospace sector is in the eighth year of an extended upcycle but there are some concerns about airline profitability that usually drives jet orders, speakers at the Airline Economics conference in Hong Kong said this week.
Even so, planemakers and their suppliers are pushing production to record levels based on eight years' worth of new plane orders, and their attention is focused on ironing out flaws in an already stretched global supply chain.
Airbus said talks aimed at overhauling a loss-making contract with European buyer nations for the delayed A400M military airlifter were advancing ""a bit slower than planned,"" as Airbus focuses on commercial deliveries and securing the ramp-up of the A320neo family, which includes the A321neo.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alternative asset manager  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) on Wednesday missed estimates for earnings per unit for the third quarter, as the value of its private equity investments rose less than that one of its key rivals.
Carlyle, which owns assets such as British premium car service Addison Lee and U.S. entertainment services provider Apex Parks Group, said quarterly economic net income per unit came in at 25 cents. That missed analysts' expectations for 51 cents, according to Refinitiv data, and compared with 56 cents a year earlier. 
Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Carlyle's portfolio and is a key earnings metric for many U.S. private equity firms.
Carlyle's corporate private equity funds, from which it earns performance fees, increased in value by 1 percent in the three months to end-September. Rival Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) reported a rise of 7.5 percent in the value of its private equity holdings in the same period. 
Despite the earnings miss, Carlyle's assets under management grew to $212.3 billion, with $6 billion raised in the quarter and $26 billion raised so far in 2018. Carlyle has a $30 billion fundraising target for 2018, part of a larger $100 billion fundraising goal.
""During the third quarter, we remained on track or ahead of schedule for many of the goals we laid out for the year and we have good momentum for future growth,"" Co-Chief Executives Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. 
""Global markets are growing increasingly volatile, but we believe Carlyle is well positioned to take advantage of market dislocations and opportunities,"" the pair added, echoing comments last week by rival KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR).
After-tax distributable earnings (DE) - the actual cash available for paying dividends - fell year on year to $194.7 million from $254.5 million. Peers Blackstone and KKR reported year-on-year rises in after-tax DE.
Carlyle also said it would pay a quarterly distribution of 42 cents per common unit.

Despite making a lot of noise about its electric vehicle-focused mines such as nickel, copper and cobalt, Glencore has continued to buy more coal assets, adding rival Rio Tinto’s Australian operations to its portfolio this year. That, along with soaring coal prices, will see profit jump to $6.2 billion next year, according to a presentation.
Coal-mining profit will eclipse copper earnings -- which are forecast by analysts to be about $5.5 billion -- for the first time since the trading house sold shares in London in 2011.
Coal producers have been raking in profit as the price of the dirtiest fuel soars. Those gains have been underpinned by rising Chinese demand for high-quality imported coal, while many in the mining industry are reluctant to build new capacity as banks and investors shun the sector.
Glencore said its record coal profit will be driven by an almost 10 percent gain in shipments, while costs will fall from $52 a ton to $49 a ton.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rallied on Wednesday as a tumultuous October drew to a close and strong results from L'Oreal, Sanofi and banks  Standard Chartered  and Santander soothed investors' nerves. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 1.5 percent by 0945 GMT, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) 1.3 percent higher.
Despite gains, the STOXX 600 was on track for its worst month since January 2016 after global equity markets reeled from sudden sell-offs and a pick-up in volatility this month. 
The euro zone stocks index (STOXXE) remained on course for its worst month since August 2015.
Analysts and investors said month-end repositioning was part of the reason for the strong bounce on Wednesday. 
""Ultimately I'm still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. 
""I still think there is an element of complacency, or at least a lack of sense of any real panic - particularly in retail investor sentiment,"" he added.
L’Oreal (PA:OREP) shares jumped 5.9 percent after sales growth at the company, whose brands include Maybelline, picked up pace in the third quarter, driven by booming demand in Asia.
This bucked the trend of results so far warning of slower Chinese growth.
""Management hosted a confident conference call reiterating confidence in the goal of achieving organic sales growth ahead of global market growth in 2018,"" wrote Liberum analysts.
Shares in French pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 5.2 percent after it confirmed its return to growth with higher-than-expected third-quarter profits and raised its 2018 profit target for the second time this year.
Banks Santander (MC:SAN) and Standard Chartered (L:STAN) rose 3.8 and 5.7 percent respectively after both lenders reported better results, helping boost sentiment in the battered banks sector. 
Outside of earnings, the market was lifted by oil and gas stocks (SXEP) as crude prices jumped, and tech stocks which have been among the worst hit by this month's slide. 
Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) were top gainers.
Earnings disappointments still took big chunks out of some stocks. 
Finnish tire maker Nokian (HE:NRE1V) sank 13.3 percent after it cut its profit outlook, blaming unfavorable currency moves, high inventory levels in Russia, and lower new car sales in the Nordics for a surprise fall in quarterly earnings.
Nokian was the latest in the autos sector to report weaker profits due to slowing car sales.
Eutelsat (PA:ETL) shares dived 10.6 percent after the satellite firm cut its revenue guidance.
Drugmaker  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  (ST:SOBIV) dropped 13.6 percent after it cut its full-year outlook due to development costs, even though it lifted its sales forecast after a strong performance by haemophilia drug Elocta.
M&A also drove some big moves. 
Shares in British gambling firm  William Hill  (L:WMH) jumped 8.3 percent after it offered to buy Swedish gaming company Mr Green (ST:MRG) for 2.82 billion crowns ($307 million).
Shares in the acquisition target surged 47 percent in early deals after the offer, a near 49 percent premium to Mr Green's last closing price.
Investors were licking their wounds after a testing October for global stock markets which saw U.S. stocks sell off sharply, joining in the already bearish trend of other developed markets. 
""Markets are going to have to get on board with the idea (U.S.) earnings are not going to grow by 20 percent every quarter,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.

""Since 2012 we have transformed our approach to financial-crime controls and risk management,"" Winters said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. ""We’ve seen an almost ten-fold increase in our annual financial crime compliance spending and a more than seven-fold increase in headcount dedicated to this.""
Meanwhile, Chief Finance Officer Andy Halford said the bank continues to cooperate with U.S. authorities on resolving the Iran sanctions probe, and that it’s too early to provision for any likely fine. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month the London-based lender is bracing for a potential penalty of around $1.5 billion for allowing customers to violate Iran sanctions.
Winters said that U.S. authorities who are probing Standard Chartered shared his view that the bank had made ""substantial progress.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) went back to its Berlin roots on Wednesday as it announced plans to invest up to 600 million euros ($681 million) to create an industrial and technology hub in the German capital.
The investment will help to create a new Siemensstadt, or Siemens city, in the part of Berlin where the engineering group's predecessor company set up factories at the end of the 19th century.
The new project in Spandau, which covers an area of 70 hectares, aims to transform the large industrial area into a modern, urban district of the future, to promote innovation and collaboration between sciences and business, Siemens said.
As part of the project, Siemens' current property in Spandau is to be developed into a technology park and base for business start-ups by the end of 2030.
Activities in fields such as distributed energy systems and energy management, electric vehicle technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain are to be based in Siemensstadt, the company said.
Siemens said the investment signaled its long-term commitment to Germany as a business location. Hundreds of jobs are likely to be created, though Siemens said it was too early to give a precise figure.
Last month the company said it would cut about 2,900 jobs in Germany as part of a restructuring plan to achieve 500 million euros in cost savings.
The trains-to-industrial-turbines group also said on Wednesday that it will create an industrial and scientific campus on the Berlin site to look at conventional power plant technology.
Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said the new Siemensstadt would follow the example of the original Siemmensstadt by helping to shape future industry.
""The idea behind the founding of Siemensstadt in 1897 was to combine space for working, researching and living to cultivate a beneficial symbiosis for a successful future,"" he said.
""Today, too, we need to rethink the future of work. Working, learning and residential living will be more integrated, and increasing connectivity among people and things will create new ecosystems.""
Berlin mayor, Michael Mueller, said new jobs would be created and the city's status as a scientific center would be boosted by the investment.

""The impact of the money laundering scandal on the Estonian financial sector overall remains small,"" the Bank of Estonia said in a statement.
The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which Denmark's largest bank said in a report last month it regards as suspicious.
The central bank said the situation in the banking sector has improved since.
""The lion's share of the funding for the Estonian banking sector comes from resident client deposits and the share of non-resident deposits has fallen over the years and is now only 7 percent,"" the central bank said. 

""Companies from outside the European Union, which may be considered the riskiest clients, are now less than 1 percent of all clients,"" it said.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Australia's banking watchdog rejects blame for lenders' misconduct,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prudential watchdog rejected on Wednesday criticism it was too soft in regulating the country's beleaguered banking industry, saying it is mandated to focus on material risks to banks' stability and not on their treatment of customers.
Australia's biggest banks are in damage-control mode after a powerful inquiry, called a Royal Commission, uncovered a culture of greed and widespread misconduct in the industry.
The Commission's interim report last month reserved special criticism for regulators that failed to pick up or punish problems ranging from billing fees to the dead to aggressive loan selling.
Responding to the report's criticism that it failed to prosecute banks and had too narrow a focus, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA), said its handling of misconduct was ""broadly appropriate"" and reforming its remit was unnecessary.
""APRA has largely focused its response to matters that relate to prudential risks and on issues that may have a material impact on the regulated entity concerned,"" the regulator said in its submission to the Commission, published on Wednesday. 
""That some information was not known to APRA is not surprising,"" it said, adding the scale of its task leaves it reliant on bank assurances that their behavior is legal and fair, shifting much of the blame on to the banks themselves. 
""Solutions to past problems must involve industry taking more responsibility, not less, for maintaining appropriate standards of conduct and guarding against misconduct.""
The Commission has shredded the finance sector's reputation and value, with some A$60 billion ($43 billion) wiped from the market capitalization of Australia's four largest banks and wealth manager AMP Ltd since it was announced.
Investors are bracing for it to recommend structural changes and extra regulatory scrutiny when it issues its final report in February, though APRA said on Wednesday wholesale regulatory changes were not needed because it would unnecessarily complicate things.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd slashed 2018 capex by more than a quarter on Wednesday and warned of lower profit until early next year, calling an end to a two-year boom in memory chips that fueled record third-quarter profit.
Graphic: Samsung Electronics' earnings IMG - http://tmsnrt.rs/23JLkmD
The downbeat forecast by the world's biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones adds to investor jitters over waning global demand for mobile and other electronics devices that roiled world stock markets this month.
Graphic: Samsung Electronics' operating profit growth interactive - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OW0c5E
The South Korean technology giant said it expected a quarter-on-quarter earnings decline in the fourth quarter due to weak demand for memory chips and higher smartphone marketing spend during the year-end holiday season.
""Looking further ahead to 2019, earnings are forecast to be weak for the first quarter due to seasonality, but then strengthen as business conditions, particularly in the memory market, improve,"" Samsung said in a statement.
Analysts said the capex cut should ease concerns over further supply growth and price declines, as prices of some memory chips have already fallen to over two-year lows and rivals are set to start new production lines next year.
Samsung, one of the industry's biggest buyers of chip-manufacturing tools, said its capital spending this year would drop by 27 percent to 31.8 trillion won ($28 billion) from a record 43.4 trillion won last year.
""NAND (flash memory) chip prices will further decline through the first half of next year ... (as) Toshiba's new production line will start and Hynix starts mass production of one of its NAND lines,"" said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
""Oversupply is expected to continue.""
Samsung, however, sought to assuage investor concerns of a steep downturn in the chip market, citing solid demand from servers as cloud-based data services grow fast.
A Samsung executive said the company believed it was at the ""start of a virtuous up-cycle"" in chip sales to the server industry.
""Temporary price changes can repeat but fundamentally we have a very strong demand base for memory,"" Chun Sewon, senior vice president of Samsung's memory marketing, told analysts.
Samsung also said it was considering converting some of its NAND production lines to make DRAM chips next year, rather than add capacity amid a glut of NAND flash chips.
SOFT LANDING
Samsung reported a record 17.6 trillion won operating profit in the July-September quarter, in line with the company's estimate.
With chip prices weakening after years of stellar growth, analysts expect Samsung's fourth-quarter profit will decline by 4 percent from the third quarter's record, according to Refinitiv data.
That will be still up 11 percent from a year ago, helped by efficiency improvements and cost-cutting in the chip business, which accounts for nearly four-fifths of Samsung's operating profit.
""Since Samsung continues to reduce the costs of (semiconductors), it is not very likely to witness a so-called hard-landing situation,"" said Avril Wu, senior research director at DRAMeXchange.
Higher server demand would help the memory chip market regain stability after the first quarter of next year, Samsung said, chiming with the outlook given by South Korean peer SK Hynix last week.
Samsung's semiconductor business booked a 37 percent rise in operating profit to 13.7 trillion won, while the mobile business posted a 33 percent fall to 2.2 trillion won.
Squeezed by competition with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the premium segment and with Chinese rivals in other segments, Samsung's smartphone business saw profit fall to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2017.
It plans to share details of its development of foldable smartphones at a conference early next month, hoping the model will help revive its premium cache.
Samsung said third-quarter revenue rose 5.5 percent to 65.5 trillion won, slightly ahead of its guidance.
Shares in Samsung, which has $265 billion in market value, fell 1.2 percent. The stock has fallen 16 percent so far this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc (N:BKS) on Tuesday filed a countersuit seeking damages from the former chief executive officer it fired in part because of claims he sexually harassed a female employee.
The largest U.S. bookstore chain said Demos Parneros breached his duties of loyalty and good faith by sexually harassing the female employee, bullying subordinates, and attempting to ""sabotage"" a potential sale of the New York-based company.
In a statement, Parneros rejected Barnes & Noble’s accusations. He said he never bullied anyone, called the sexual harassment claim “completely false,” and said he was ""fully supportive of the sales process from the start"".
Parneros had accused Barnes & Noble of breach of contract and defamation in his Aug. 28 lawsuit, saying the company and Leonard Riggio, its founder and largest shareholder, made up reasons to fire him in July after just 14 months.
He sought more than $4 million of severance plus other damages.
In its countersuit, Barnes & Noble said Parneros' lawsuit ""downplays what occurred,"" and that the company should recoup his salary, bonus and other benefits during the period of his ""disloyal conduct"" and cancel his outstanding equity awards.
Barnes & Noble said the female employee reported two incidents in which Parneros allegedly subjected her to unwanted touching or comments of a sexual nature.
It said that in the second incident, Parneros allegedly pulled the employee toward him so their faces touched, and as she tried to pull away he said she seemed like someone who ""would put out"" if he ""wined and dined"" her.
Barnes & Noble also said Parneros derailed a takeover that would have cost him the CEO role, after portraying the company as an ""ugly mess"" that had ""no realistic prospects for success"" in a June meeting with executives of the potential acquirer.
According to the countersuit, Barnes & Noble has received ""additional complaints about Parneros' inappropriate behavior toward women"" at the company since his termination. Barnes & Noble declined to elaborate.
The company is now considering its options, which could include a sale, and in July appointed a three-person leadership group to share the CEO duties until a replacement for Parneros could be found. Riggio remained executive chairman.
Barnes & Noble's share price has fallen by nearly two-thirds since July 2015. It has struggled with falling sales and foot traffic amid competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Tuesday relieved investors by forecasting that margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease up, sending shares up despite a second-straight quarter with record-low user growth.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg repeated the company's warning that growing user interest in private messaging, video and safer content would cause costs to rise faster than revenue for “some time.” But he said he was focused on bringing them in line. 
That same guidance three months ago sparked Facebook's biggest one-day sell-off as some investors braced for dire results. The third-quarter performance and revised guidance suggested that the downward trend would be more gradual and taper off after 2019, financial analysts said. 
Shares of Facebook traded up about 3 percent after updating its forecast. They reversed course several times, falling and gaining as much as 5 percent, during an hour of volatility after closing on Tuesday up 2.9 percent at $146.22. 
Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) had suffered a battering over the last month on Wall Street after leading a years-long rally. Slowing growth has been a top concern, and Facebook's weak results did not squash those fears.
""The best news was that the quarter was just not a disaster,"" Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners, told Reuters. 
The company estimated revenue growth would slow in the current quarter, compared with last quarter, which could mark the worst performance since its initial public offering in 2012.
The main Facebook service and its Messenger sibling grew monthly users to 2.27 billion, up 10 percent compared with a year ago but a percentage point below both expectations and last quarter's pace.
Zuckerberg said that Facebook's problem is that users are gravitating toward features such as direct messaging and video viewing faster than it can find ways to place ads there while attracting clicks and not annoying users. 
Adding to the challenge is that the bulk of new users are from countries including India, Indonesia and Philippines where advertisers focus more on TV, print and outdoor advertising, Facebook executives said.
Average revenue per U.S and Canadian user grew 6.7 percent in third quarter compared with the same period last year. Growth for Asian-Pacific users was 4.6 percent. 
Though the factors are holding back ad prices, they also leave Facebook with significant untapped commercial opportunities with newer businesses such as WhatsApp. Still, Facebook said WhatsApp would not be a revenue driver in 2019.
A few financial analysts are concerned that the company's operational problems are so vast that revenue growth and cost containment will not come as expected.
The company disclosed its latest gaffe on Tuesday, saying that its misclassification of user activity had led to immaterial overcounting of monthly and daily users.
More broadly, the social network's reputation has suffered from a data breach affecting 29 million users in September and a privacy scandal involving a British political consulting firm in March.
It also has been rocked by domestic and international information warfare on its services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, and a wave of executive departures.
About 2.6 billion users interact with at least one of Facebook's services each month, up from 2.5 billion when it released the figure for the first time last quarter to emphasize that its potential audience for advertisers is unrivaled in size.
Facebook's spending has ballooned from licensing more engaging content such as video, and as it tries to fortify itself against fraudsters and hackers.
Zuckerberg said upcoming elections would be a test of its new systems, which he expects will be fully installed by end of 2019.
""With a community of more than 2 billion people, we will see all the good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect,"" he said.
Total expenses in the third quarter surged to nearly $8 billion, up 53 percent compared with a year ago. Operating margin, which Facebook has said should fall around 35 percent, dropped 2 percentage points from last quarter, to 42 percent.
The company estimated 2018 expenses would rise 50 percent to 55 percent above last year, trimming an earlier range of up to 60 percent. It forecasts expenses will grow 40 percent to 50 percent in 2019.
Overall third-quarter revenue was $13.7 billion, up 33 percent from the same period last year and in line with expectations when accounting for currency fluctuations. 
Quarterly profit of $5.1 billion, or $1.76 per share, was up 9 percent and above the average per-share estimate of $1.48.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's team approached Roberto Castello Branco, a former board member at state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) (Petrobras), about the possibility of his becoming its new chief executive, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
The sources, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter publicly, said Castello Branco initially turned down the idea. Bolsonaro's main advisers did not immediately comment on the matter.
Castello Branco had recent meetings with the Bolsonaro team led by incoming Finance minister Paulo Guedes to discuss oil and mining issues, given his prior experience. Castello Branco has also been director at miner Vale SA (SA:VALE3).
The sources said that while Castello Branco did not commit immediately to the Petrobras post, he said he was willing to contribute to the elected government. The conversation did not represent a formal invitation, one of the sources said, adding that he might evaluate an offer if it came.
Castello Branco, currently a professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), has a PhD from the University of Chicago, where Guedes also studied.

The first half saw 14 insurance deals worth over 500 million euros ($567.80 million), but total deal volume fell to 84 deals, the lowest number since 2009, the report showed.
The report cited the changing nature of business models as a driver for deals, with regulatory pressures leading to new models and more firms trying to return to their core strategy. 
The report also said companies are divesting unwanted parts of their business, meaning that valuable assets are once again on the market. The report included completed deals with a value of at least $5 million.
For private equity investors, record levels of inflow – with cash reserves reaching $1 trillion in 2017 – has driven interest in insurance assets, leading to complex acquisitions from these buyers in 2018.
Private equity firm Bain Capital agreed to buy esure (L:ESUR) for 1.21 billion pounds in August, ending over two years of speculation around the British insurer being a takeover target for U.S. private equity firms.
According to the report regulatory change has played a big role in the U.S., as tax reform in the country has provided an immediate boost to company earnings since the turn of the year.
""Debt continues to be cheap, and following the recent tax reforms, U.S. companies have been given a steroid kick. We will continue to see an active M&A market,"" Managing Director at Willis Towers Watson Jack Gibson, said.
""It's just a matter of paying the right price and overcoming the hurdles that have led to deals taking longer to consummate and perhaps driving the lower number of deals this year.""
Earlier in September, U.S. financial services group Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (N:MMC) agreed to buy  Jardine Lloyd  Thompson (L:JLT) valuing the British insurance and reinsurance broker at about 4.3 billion pounds.
The report highlighted growing investment from Asian companies, but said political and economic uncertainty could affect global dealmaking, with volatility surrounding Britain's impending exit from the European Union and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington threatening appetites.
The period also saw seven deals in the reinsurance sector and  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) expects the global reinsurance industry to consolidate as the distinction between insurers and reinsurers become increasingly blurred.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:57PM ET</span>","Yields steady, volume low with spate of data ahead","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds were steady in light trading on Tuesday as investors held off on making big moves ahead of this week's spate of economic data.
Yields were up modestly on the day, aided by a recovery in equities after Monday's sell-off and a raucous month driven by U.S. stock market volatility.
Daily trading volume was at its lowest in more than a week ahead of the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) private payrolls report and the Treasury refunding announcement due on Wednesday, the Markit PMI Manufacturing Index and the ISM Manufacturing Index on Thursday, and the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday.
""Treasuries are following the stock market right now. The volume has been relatively light and I think it will remain so until the jobs number on Friday and the election next week,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading. 
Trading volume of the Chicago Board of Trade 10-year U.S. Treasury note composite bond future was down by nearly 100 percent on Tuesday afternoon from Monday's high. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government note was up around 2 basis points, as were yields on the 30-year bond and two-year note.
Treasury yields have fallen in October as companies have reported that tariffs, rising borrowing costs and a slowdown in China hurt earnings in the third quarter and are expected to do the same in the fourth. Stock prices, and yields, were driven lower following a Bloomberg report on Monday that Washington was preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between Trump and his counterpart President Xi Jinping failed to ease a trade war.
The report sparked a wild ride on Wall Street on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) falling more than 900 points from its high and the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) closing within a whisker of confirming correction territory. U.S. Treasury debt, a safe-haven investment, rises in price in times of volatility.
The sell-off was stanched on Tuesday after Trump - in an interview with Fox News Channel late Monday - said he expected ""a great deal"" with China on trade, but warned new tariffs would be imposed if a deal was not possible.
On Wednesday, the Treasury will make its quarterly refunding announcement. Analysts expect that two-, three-, and five-year note auctions will be increased by $1 billion a month, and that seven-, 10- and 30-year bond auctions will increase by $1 billion a quarter.

(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by managing costs at a time when bigger rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) missed revenue estimates and forecast sales below expectations for the holiday quarter.
Shares of EBay, which also expects fourth-quarter profit marginally above analysts' estimates, rose as much as 6.0 percent in after-hours trading. The shares have fallen 27 percent so far in 2018.
The San Jose, California-based company has been splurging on product developments, brand marketing and making its website more user-friendly to better compete with increased competition in the online shopping sphere, while also cutting jobs to rein in costs.
""Effective expenses management has resulted in consistent EPS upside,"" said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte.
EBay's initiatives like grouped listings that let buyers see all identical items grouped together, personal recommendations, and a simplified payment process have also helped lure more online shoppers. The company said it had 177 million active buyers in the third quarter, compared to 175 million in the second.
EBay forecast fourth-quarter adjusted profit of 67 cents to 69 cents per share and revenue of $2.85 billion to $2.89 billion.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 67 cents per share and revenue of $2.90 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue from StubHub, EBay's marketplace for event tickets, rose 6.0 percent to $286 million, setting aside some fears of slowing growth in the business and showing that a strategy of expanding into international and non-traditional ticket markets was bearing fruit.
""StubHub delivered modest volume acceleration in Q3, driven primarily by strength in concerts, partially offset by a weaker NFL performance,"" Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig said on a post-earnings call.
However, EBay's total gross merchandise volume (GMV), the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain timeframe, rose 4.8 percent to $22.72 billion in the third quarter, but missed Refinitiv estimates of $23.40 billion.
The company's profit rose to $721 million, or 73 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $520 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 56 cents per share, beating estimates of 54 cents.

Net revenue rose 6 percent to $2.65 billion, in line with analyst expectations.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","After tragedies and big losses, Hyundai looks to reverse North Korea fortunes","By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - For Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, North Korea has been a story of lost opportunities – and tragedy.
In 2003, months before Hyundai was set to open an industrial complex in North Korea, the executive behind the project committed suicide amid accusations his company had made a secret $500 million payment to the North. 
Five years later, a Hyundai-run resort in the North was closed after a North Korean soldier shot a South Korean tourist.
Both projects have long been shuttered, symbolizing the difficulties South Korean companies have had doing business across the border.
But, emboldened by a thawing of relations on the Korean peninsula and attracted by its promise of cheap labor and untapped growth, Hyundai is again preparing to return to North Korea.
Hyundai executives and investors are encouraged by a pledge by Seoul and Pyongyang to re-open the Kaesong industrial park and the Mt. Kumgang resort as part of a warming in ties between the neighbors.
International sanctions over the North's nuclear weapons program make it unclear how quickly investments can resume. But executives and investors are betting Hyundai stands to benefit the most from any peace dividend on the Korean peninsula.
“We have invested a lot for a long time, and have a solid and wide network and business rights there,"" said Baek Cheon-ho, a senior executive at Hyundai Asan, the subsidiary that managed the Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang projects. ""Combining all that, Hyundai will eventually be better off in North Korea."" 
For Korea Inc, struggling with high labor costs and slowing growth, North Korea's cheap labor, vast resources and huge growth potential represent an unmissable opportunity, Baek and several business executives told Reuters.
For Hyundai and its ruling family, North Korea also has symbolic importance. Founder Chung Ju-yung was born to a peasant family in Asan, North Korea and named the subsidiary to handle the group’s enterprises after his birthplace.
""We're doing this not only for Hyundai, but for the greater good of all South Korean companies,"" Baek said. ""If we restart our North Korea businesses, there will be many new jobs for us, but also for a number of other firms working with us."" 
EBB AND FLOW
Hyundai's ebb and flow in North Korea also illustrate how it could again become one of the biggest casualties from any setback in international efforts to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program. 
Other South Korean conglomerates such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Lotte have made smaller bets on North Korea and will need to start from scratch if economic ties resume. Both have set up taskforces in recent months to explore opportunities.
Shares of unlisted Hyundai Asan have nearly quadrupled to a record high in over-the-counter trading this year. 
Other companies such as train maker Hyundai Rotem (KS:064350), builder Hyundai Engineering & Construction (KS:000720) and  Hyundai Elevator  (KS:017800), have also surged as the two Koreas work toward officially ending their 1950-53 conflict.
""Stocks like Hyundai Elevator are now going up and down driven by anticipation and headline news, rather than fundamentals,"" said Lee Gun-min, a fund manager BNK Asset Management. ""But we think there is a better chance and visibility about economic cooperation than in the past since the two Koreas are now talking about ending the war."" 
Lee manages a ""Unification Fund"" for his investment firm, targeting stocks with potential exposure to North Korea, mostly Hyundai companies such as Hyundai Elevator but also banks and logistics firms. 
'LIFELINE' 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has pushed for rapprochement with the North since his election last year, calls the Kaesong industrial park a ""lifeline"" for South Korea.
Asia's fourth-biggest economy is being squeezed globally between high-end, innovative manufacturers and low-cost producers in China and elsewhere.
Before the 2016 closure of Kaesong, some 120 South Korean companies employed 55,000 North Korean workers there, making everything from clothes and kitchen utensils to electronic components. The North Korean workers were well qualified, hard working and cost just a fraction of what workers in the South were paid, factory owners said.
Almost all small and medium enterprises which used to operate in Kaesong said they would like to go back, according to an April survey. 
Seven out of 10 South Korean companies would prefer to use North Korean workers instead of foreign migrants due to language barriers and high costs associated with hiring foreign labor, a separate survey by the Korea Federation of SMEs found.
Hyundai Asan has the most riding on the prospect of a peaceful peninsula. 
It paid $1.2 billion to buy exclusive rights for Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang, and has interests in railroads and infrastructure projects including reconnecting inter-Korean railways. 
Hyundai Asan's rights to land the size of Manhattan in Kaesong last for 50 years, and it has a plan to build an even bigger factory town if the complex reopens, accommodating 2,000 companies and 350,000 North Korean workers. 
Less than 5 percent of the total property in Kaesong has been developed currently, Hyundai told Reuters. 
Officials say Hyundai has also agreed with the North to run tours in the coastal city of Wonsan, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to build into a hotspot for tourism and foreign investment, as well as Mt. Paektu, the mythical homeland of both Koreas.
Hyundai's Baek said the company is also in talks with Seoul and state-run corporations about projects to reconnect railroads between the North and South.
""The government respects Hyundai's business rights it signed with the North,"" said a spokeswoman at South Korea's Unification Ministry, who did not respond to a question about its discussions with Hyundai. 
NO LOVE FROM WASHINGTON
South Korean government officials and business executives say the biggest hurdle is opposition from Washington, which wants to maintain sanctions until Pyongyang completely denuclearizes.
In July, Mark Lambert, director for Korean affairs at the U.S. State Department, called about 10 South Korean businessmen for a meeting at the U.S. embassy in Seoul to deliver a stern message: No resumption of any businesses until denuclearization.
“The mood in the room was bleak,” said SJTech Chairman Yoo Chang-geun, who used to operate a factory at Kaesong and attended the meeting. 
Baek, who was also present, unsuccessfully argued Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang should be waived from sanctions ""to show our goodwill to North Korea"".
A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department declined to comment on details of ""private diplomatic conversations"".
Hyundai's relationship with North Korea goes back a long way. 
Hyundai founder Chung drove 500 head of cattle across the border to the North in 1998 to aid reconciliation on the divided peninsula. 
Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, was quoted as saying: ""Our first love is Hyundai when it comes to North-South relations, a way earlier than with (South Korean) authorities,"" according to a North Korean book titled ""Patriots Who Left Their Names On Path To Unification"".
But the suspension of its North Korea projects left Hyundai Asan with combined losses of $367 million in the past decade.
Hyundai admitted it paid North Korean authorities $500 million in 2000 to secure business rights there. 
Two days after being questioned by prosecutors over the scandal, Chung Ju-yung's son and successor, Chung Mong-hun fell to his death from Hyundai headquarters. Indictments against him were dropped after his death. 
The Supreme Court gave Hyundai Asan's then chief executive a suspended jail term for violating foreign money transfer rules, but he was later pardoned.
The widow of the younger Chung now heads Hyundai Asan's parent group and visited Pyongyang in September as part of a South Korean delegation for a summit between Moon and Kim. 
""There are many hurdles to be overcome, but I feel there is hope ahead of us,"" Hyun Jeong-eun said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - A yellow excavator, forklift and other heavy equipment made by U.S. firm  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) gleam outside Cuba's annual trade fair, reflecting once-bright hopes for increased U.S.-Cuban commerce fanned by the 2014 detente between the old Cold War foes.
But inside the pavilion where U.S. firms present their wares, only eight have stands this year, according to a Reuters count. That is down from 13 last year and several dozens in 2015-16, underscoring the decline in U.S. business interest since Donald Trump became president. 
Last year, the Trump administration tightened the decades-old trade embargo on the Communist-run island once more and sharply reduced staffing at the U.S. embassy in Havana due to a series of health incidents among U.S. diplomats.
""Trump has scared everyone off,"" said Eduardo Aparicio, general manager of U.S. logistics company Apacargoexpress, operating under an exemption to the embargo allowing U.S. companies to sell food and medical supplies here.
Aparicio says he is struggling to find U.S. firms keen on doing business with Cuba given fears of reprisals from the Trump administration.
""Not that many things have changed with the Trump administration but the outlook has. It no longer feels like we are advancing,"" said Jay Brickman, vice president of Florida-based shipping company Crowley Maritime Corporation, which has been shipping to Cuba for 17 years.
""If you are a corporate executive who feels like nothing is happening, then eventually you look elsewhere.""
Brickman, Aparicio and others at Cuba's premier business event said the country's dire financial situation was another factor in declining U.S. business interest. Cuba is battling a cash crunch amid lower aid from ally Venezuela and weaker exports.
Brickman said Cuban orders via his firm were down 10 percent this year.
U.S. companies had embraced Cuba in the wake of the detente reached by former U.S. and Cuban Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro, jostling for a foothold in an opening market of 11 million consumers.
Lawyers working with U.S. firms interested in doing business with Cuba say the larger ones are taking a long-term view and remain keen.
Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, for example, had lobbied to sell in Cuba for years before one of its dealers, privately held Puerto Rican company Rimco, said last year it was opening a distribution center here.
""This is the beginning of a lot of things to come,"" Rimco Vice President Caroline McConnie said of the machinery displayed outside the pavilion.
McConnie said Rimco would look to rent as well as sell machines in Cuba given its cash crunch, and expected to announce its first two deals soon: one to rent equipment for quarries and another to sell marine motors for tugboats.
""We will benefit from the first movers' advantage,"" she said.

Faraday Future, which has ambitions of overtaking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), said its senior vice president for global product and technology Peter Savagian has stepped down as well.
The move comes as the company is embroiled in a stand-off with its primary investor, China's Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd, after a planned $2 billion investment from the unit of Evergrande Group went sour.
""Recent actions taken by Evergrande is causing FF to experience extraordinary financial hardship,"" the company told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""The investor has intervened in the company's capital planning and is preventing FF from utilizing our assets, which requires FF to take some very difficult yet necessary actions,"" the company said.
Faraday Future can seek financing from sources other than Evergrande Health, according to an interim ruling earlier this month, by a Hong Kong arbitration court in a dispute between the startup and its main investor.
The company said it has now asked certain employees to take an unpaid leave of absence for November and December and is offering other employees the option of taking leave for the same period of time.

""We anticipate the furlough to last through the end of December 2018,"" the company said.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>",MSCI indexes will not restrict stocks that deny shareholders a vote,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Index provider  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI) said on Tuesday it would allow companies that give shareholders unequal voting rights to remain on its current equity indexes, backing down from an earlier proposal that would have reduced exposure to such companies.
But MSCI, whose indexes guide hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, said it would launch a new set of indexes that could give investors a choice to avoid companies based on voting rights next year.
A decision to restrict companies in its flagship indexes would have affected dozens of stocks around the world, including technology heavyweights  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Many fund operators merely copy the index rather than making a choice about which stocks to hold and could have been forced to sell stock as a result of the decision.
The proposal raised concern among some investors who want indexes to mirror the full market.
BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest fund manager and a top MSCI client, in April said securities regulators, not index providers, should set international standards for shareholder voting rights. It said MSCI's proposal could distort markets.
Uneven voting structures has been a hot corporate governance topic, especially as a number of newly listed U.S. technology firms, such as  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and Dropbox Inc (O:DBX), have listed shares that retain lopsided decision-making power with company founders and other insiders.
Remy Briand, a MSCI managing director and chairman of its Index Policy Committee, said in an interview that regulators or stock exchanges are the logical institution to address voting rights.
He said MSCI did not take competitive concerns into account in making its decision and faced very divided opinion from its clients.
""There was a divide, a divide which was quite clear, which is a little bit unusual,"" said Briand. ""The topic is difficult and the shock was quite high in the context of Snap in particular.""
Last year, S&P Dow Jones Indices started excluding companies with multiple classes of shares from the S&P 500 (SPX) and other indexes, a move that effectively barred Snap after its decision to offer stock with no voting rights.
It did not apply the rule to existing index components, including Alphabet and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa). 

FTSE Russell implemented a similar rule last year, requiring new constituents of its indexes to have at least 5 percent of their voting rights in the hands of public shareholders, while giving a five-year grace period to existing constituents that did not meet the threshold.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>","Ex-Valeant, Philidor executives get prison for fraud","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former executive at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (NYSE:BHC) and the former head of a start-up mail-order pharmacy were sentenced to one year in prison on Tuesday after being convicted of defrauding the drugmaker through a secret kickback scheme.
Gary Tanner, 41, the former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, 50, the former chief executive of Philidor Rx Services LLC, were also ordered to forfeit $9.7 million, representing the alleged kickback.
The sentences were imposed by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan.
Both defendants had been convicted in May on four charges, including honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Prosecutors had recommended prison terms of between 2-1/2 and 10 years for Tanner, and 2-1/2 and eight years for Davenport. The defendants said no prison time was justified.
Lawyers for Tanner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sharon McCarthy, a lawyer for Davenport, said her client plans to appeal his conviction, but that the sentence was ""extremely fair.""
The case was the first criminal prosecution arising from multiple probes into Valeant's business practices, including its ties to the now-defunct Philidor.
Those ties began drawing scrutiny in October 2015, when investors learned that Valeant had in 2014 acquired an option to buy Philidor, and was suspected of using it to boost sales.
The revelations contributed to a steep fall in Valeant's share price that was compounded by the probes and the Laval, Quebec-based company's heavy debt load.
Management was overhauled, and Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Cos in July, taken from the name of its Bausch & Lomb eye care unit.
Tanner had managed Valeant's relationship with Philidor as well as Valeant's ""alternative fulfillment"" program, through which the drugmaker sought to increase prescriptions for its own drugs instead of cheaper generic substitutes.
Prosecutors accused Tanner of steering Valeant business to Philidor, while concealing a $9.7 million kickback from Davenport that came from the roughly $50 million Davenport received when Valeant acquired the option to buy his company.
""I deeply regret giving money to Gary Tanner,"" Davenport told Preska.
Prosecutors said that to keep the scheme secret, Tanner often used an email account with the name ""Brian Wilson"" to communicate with Davenport and sabotage potential business with rival pharmacies.
""Tanner was entrusted to manage Valeant's relationship with Davenport's company,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. ""Instead, they devised a scheme to pillage Valeant and share the proceeds.""  

The case is U.S. v Tanner et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 17-cr-00061.

890,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Facebook Blows Away Profit Estimates Despite Tepid Revenue
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be a big mover for the market tomorrow morning if investors can get a handle on whether they like the company's latest quarterly results or not.
Shares of Facebook fell right after the release of its postmarket results on weak revenue, but then buyers came back in to push shares just into the green.
The company reported earnings per share of $1.76 on revenue of $13.73 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $13.77 billion.
The number of active users also looked slightly below Wall Street forecasts.
But the stock rose about 1% in after-hours trading, following some volatile initial trading. Shares were up about 3% in the regular trading session ahead of the results.
2. GM, Yum! and Kellogg's to Report
Among the earnings scheduled before the bell tomorrow, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stands out.
The automaker has consistently beaten profit expectations of late, but fell short on sales in the last quarter. Shares have struggled and are down more than 20% in the past year.
On average, analysts expect GM to post a profit of $1.24 per share on sales of a little more than $35 billion.
Also on the docket are earnings from fast-food operator Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) and numbers from cereal company Kellogg's (NYSE:K).
3. ADP Employment Expected to Slip
They can get lost in the deluge of earnings, but jobs numbers arrive this week as well.
Starting tomorrow, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) releases its measure of October private sector employment at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm employment rose by 189,000 this month, down from a rise in payrolls of 230,000 in September.
At 9:45 AM ET there will be numbers on Midwest manufacturing activity with the release of October’s Chicago PMI.
The PMI is forecast to have fallen very slightly to 60.3 from 60.4 the month before."
891,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Buyout firms Bain, CVC compete to acquire Papa John's - sources","By Joshua Franklin and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners are among the private equity firms competing to acquire Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA), the world's third-largest pizza delivery company, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The buyout interest in Papa John's comes amid a battle for control with its founder John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company. He resigned as chairman in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. 
Since then, Schnatter has been seeking ways to regain influence, and asked Papa John's in a letter this month to amend a poison pill provision it has adopted so that he can engage with bidders that had expressed interest in speaking to him.
Private equity firms KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and Roark Capital have also been vying for Papa John's, with binding offers expected in the next few weeks, the sources said.
Hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP, an investor in fast-food chain Wendy's Co (O:WEN) that had expressed interest in Papa John's, is considering a potential investment in Papa John's should a deal for the sale of the company fail to be reached, the sources added.
A special committee formed by Papa John's board of directors is exploring a sale as part of a wide review of strategic alternatives, and there is no certainty that the company will agree to a sale, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Papa John's, Bain, CVC, KKR and Roark declined to comment, while Trian did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Papa John's shares rose 9.3 percent to $53.41 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. They have lost a fifth of their value over the last 12 months amid uncertainty over the company's business prospects.
In August, Papa John’s posted a second-quarter comparable sales decline of 6.1 percent and cut its sales forecast, citing fallout from the company’s split with Schnatter.
Negative publicity surrounding Schnatter depressed July traffic in North America, the company said at the time, noting it was hard to predict how long and how badly that would affect sales. Papa John’s has more than 5,000 locations worldwide, mostly franchised restaurants.

Papa John’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie has vowed to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter’s image from company promotions. Two franchisee associations working with the company have expressed support for its strategy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following a steep recent pullback for equities.
All 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended higher a day after a volatile session that pushed the benchmark S&P 500 lower and close to confirming its second correction of 2018.
“You have had such a pounding here in the month of October that at some point you would expect some bouncing to begin and hold,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
“You are starting to see maybe people wading into the waters with, 'Time to buy some of these stocks.' You saw that yesterday, but obviously it just didn’t hold,"" Carlson said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 431.72 points, or 1.77 percent, to 24,874.64, the S&P 500 gained 41.38 points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,682.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.36 points, or 1.58 percent, to 7,161.65.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 4.2 percent, its biggest one-day percentage gain since March. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) surged 5.2 percent and gave the biggest single-stock boost to the S&P 500.
Chip stocks also gained following a brokerage upgrade of Nvidia shares and a better-than-expected report from chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC). Nvidia shares jumped 9.4 percent and KLA-Tencor shares rose 7.6 percent.
Chip stocks had dropped broadly on Monday, as renewed concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions sparked declines.
The Dow Jones Transport Average jumped 2.8 percent, its biggest one-day rise in about a year. A drop in oil prices may have boosted closely watched transport shares, Carlson said.
Market volatility has spiked in recent weeks, stemming from higher U.S. interest rates and worries about economic growth peaking and trade tensions. Investors also may be increasingly nervous about uncertainty surrounding U.S. congressional elections, now just a week away.
The S&P is on pace for its biggest monthly percentage drop in more than eight years.
S&P 500 companies are on pace to have posted a 25.3 percent rise in third-quarter earnings with more than half of the constituents having reported, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Despite the big overall profit increase, some high-profile companies have issued disappointing reports. On Tuesday,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shares tumbled 8.8 percent after the conglomerate drastically reduced its dividend and said it faced a deeper accounting probe.
“As earnings roll in, most of them have been OK,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""It’s just that some of the misses have been of the most well-known companies and it has kind of overshadowed a little bit of the better earnings of smaller companies or less iconic companies.”
In other earnings news, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's shares rose 2.5 percent after the beverage maker's quarterly revenue and profit topped Wall Street expectations.
Under Armour Inc's shares surged 24.7 percent after the sportswear maker's upbeat quarterly earnings and full-year profit forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 202 new lows. 

About 9.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 8.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.77%. The S&P 500 rose 1.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.58%.
A sea of green swept over Wall Street as rallying chip stocks set the stage for a rebound from a slump a day earlier, leading the broader market out of correction territory.
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) rose sharply, helping the wider tech sector pare some of its recent losses. That overshadowed mostly downbeat earnings from corporates, which did little to ease concerns about peak profit.
Despite the rally in semis, the sector is still nursing losses of nearly 20% for the month.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) rose more than 2%, strengthening consumer staples, after reporting quarterly results that beat consensus on both the top and bottom lines. The beverage giant's bullish quarterly haul was supported by strong sales of Diet Coke following its efforts to boost the brand's appeal among millennials.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) fell about 9% after the company missed earnings and revenue estimates and slashed its dividend to a penny in a bid to bolster its balance sheet. Its shares came under heavy pressure after it disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was expanding a probe into the company's accounting practices.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, supported the move higher in the broader market, shrugging off a slump in oil prices amid fears rising trade tensions could hurt oil demand.
The rally on Wall Street comes as analysts touted further gains in the broader averages on the back of month-end buying, decreased volatility and the return of share buybacks.
The October month-end will lead fixed-weight asset managers to increase their equity exposure, JPMorgan said.
""We also expect volatility to decline into year-end, which should prompt systematic investors to re-build equity positions,"" it added.
In corporate news, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reversed an initial slump in after-hours trade after it beat on earnings, but fell short of revenue estimates as active user growth missed estimates.
Facebook reported earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $13.73 billion, compared with estimates for earnings of $1.47 a share on revenue of $13.77 billion.
On the economic front, consumer confidence hit an 18-year high, reaffirming the narrative of a strong U.S. economy.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 137.9 in October from 135.3 in September, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 136. That was the highest reading in since Sept. 2000.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
 Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA), Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) and Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>","Third Point, Campbell spar over plans for company's future","(Reuters) - Investment firm Third Point LLC and  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) squared off over plans for the company's future on Tuesday, with the hedge fund pushing for hiring a ""highly qualified"" chief executive officer and the company saying it was already searching for a permanent chief. 
Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, unveiled a 100-day plan that includes reviewing the company's recently concluded strategic review and reevaluating its planned divestitures, hiring a ""world-class permanent CEO"" and refreshing the company's core legacy products.
The company said the hedge fund ""simply and effectively copied and pasted the actual plan outlined by Campbell"", adding that the plan was not thoroughly thought out.
""Vote for us and we'll think of something,"" the company said about Third Point's plan.
Loeb has nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell's controlling family, to replace all board members at the Nov. 29 annual meeting, in what will be the season's most contentious proxy battle.
But he faces a high hurdle with other heirs controlling roughly 40 percent of the company.
Loeb and his nominees are set to make their case to influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday that will issue a report in several weeks.
Campbell has been hurt by falling soup sales and a higher debt burden in the wake of its Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis.
The company said on Tuesday it was already searching for a permanent chief, with Third Point saying the proxy contest would make it difficult for Campbell to attract top talent. 
The hedge fund said Bill Toler, a member of its slate and CEO of Hostess Brands, would be prepared to step in as interim CEO if needed. 
Third Point last week sued Campbell in a New Jersey court alleging that the company misled investors with incorrect statement. 
A ruling could come as soon as Friday which could potentially allow the hedge fund's lawyers to question Campbell board members Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance.

916,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",How Low Can the FANG Stocks Go? Traders Search for a Bottom,"(Bloomberg) -- How low can they go?
That’s the key question for traders looking at some of Wall Street’s largest tech and internet stocks, which have been among the most dramatic laggards in the market recently after leading it higher for most of the year.
The so-called FANG stocks have dropped precipitously this month as disappointing growth outlooks torpedoed the thesis that their lofty valuations are supported by fundamentals. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). have seen particular weakness, with the one-time trading favorites getting an equally aggressive move to the downside as the momentum that made them such successful bets for years now works against them.
Other FANG stocks, including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., have also seen double-digit drops in recent weeks. The sell-off “is another momentum play,” according to Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird & Co.
“The market was loaded into these names and now there’s an unwinding, just as you’re seeing in the marijuana industry,” said Bittles, referring to another formerly hot sector. “Now there’s such strong downside momentum that any attempt at a rally fades. People keep calling bottoms and getting hurt; they’re trying to catch falling knives, but the decline still hasn’t caught up to the fundamentals.”
Bittles said he won’t feel like the tide has turned until 90 percent of the trading volume in a single session is to the upside. “I’m looking for a capitulation, and then a rally. Otherwise it seems like the market’s narrow leadership is catching up with the deterioration seen under the major averages,” he said in a phone interview.
Amazon fell as as much as 4.1 percent on Tuesday, its third straight daily drop, even as the broader market rebounded. The company remains on track for its worst month since November 2008, and the sell-off has taken it to its lowest intraday levels since April. Meanwhile, Netflix fell as much as 4.8 percent, extending its own three-day slide, and the stock’s worst monthly performance since April 2012.
Shares of both companies fell below their 200-day moving averages last week but are still sharply higher on the year, suggesting there is still plenty of room for downside.
Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., said investors are paying renewed attention to fundamentals, particularly in an uncertain environment marked by rising interest rates and a potential worsening trade war. Amazon and Netflix look pricey by traditional metrics, one reason that investors have begun to pivot to “old tech” names that have slower growth, but less-rich valuations.
“After Amazon’s report, people started asking why they should pay 90 times earnings for 30 percent growth,” Matousek said in a phone interview. “They just started selling and selling, and that caused the stock to break under key levels that had been holding and keeping people interested.”
Matousek said traders were looking to the April lows in major FAANG names as potential entry points. Netflix broke below that level Tuesday, trading below $280. On a closing basis, Amazon’s April low comes in around $1,372, while it is about $1,010 for Alphabet.
The next test for the group comes soon with Facebook reporting earnings after the close.

917,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",PDVSA Bewilders Bond Analysts by Making $949 Million Payment,"(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela just forked over almost $1 billion to stay current on a bond backed by shares of its U.S. refiner Citgo.
The question is why.
Yes, the payment ensures that Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA gets to hold onto Citgo Holding Inc. for now, but many analysts think it’s just a matter of time before it has to forfeit the company.
""It is hard to visualize a scenario in which Venezuela does not sooner or later lose Citgo to one of its defaulted creditors,"" Francisco Rodriguez, chief economist at brokerage Torino Capital, wrote in a note on Monday.
With Venezuela starved for cash and already in default on many of its foreign bonds, the line of creditors that could lay their hands on Citgo is very, very long: Russia (from collateral for loans from state-run Rosneft); Canadian miner Crystallex International Corp. and U.S. oil giant ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) (both of which won international arbitration cases against Venezuela); Citgo’s own bondholders (from collateral on debt); and the PDVSA bondholders who were paid Monday.
Given this backdrop, most analysts have struggled to come up with a clear-cut explanation for why the payment was made. Here are a handful of the most plausible theories that they put forward:"
918,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler's lower cash forecast overshadows special dividend pledge,"By Agnieszka Flak and Ben Klayman
MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and promised to pay 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in special dividends, but a lower net cash forecast and its over-reliance on the North American market weighed on its shares. 
Milan-listed shares in FCA (MI:FCHA) closed down 3.2 percent on Tuesday. 
The Italian-American carmaker confirmed its revenue and profit forecasts for this year, but cut its net cash estimate to between 1.5 and 2.0 billion euros from around 3 billion euros, citing production adjustments and pension contributions. 
It promised the special dividend after agreeing last week to sell parts unit Magneti Marelli to Japan's Calsonic Kansei for 6.2 billion euros.
The sale was the first big deal since Mike Manley took over in July after long-time chief Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died following complications from surgery.
Manley said the Magneti Marelli sale put FCA in the strongest position since its formation in 2014, and made its liquidity position comparable to peers.
The deal also reaffirmed his commitment to deliver on FCA's strategy to 2022 as an independent company, Manley added. 
""Closing this transaction puts us in a much stronger position ... our aim is to complete that five-year plan, deliver on our commitments as an independent (company),"" he said on a call with analysts, when asked about any future merger plans. 
The special dividend comes on top of ordinary dividends of 20 percent of earnings that the company has already pledged to pay starting early next year. Both still need to be approved by the board and shareholders. 
The world's seventh-largest carmaker said adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the July-September period rose 13 percent to 1.995 billion euros, compared with 1.87 billion euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Sales rose 9 percent, above expectations, helped by higher shipments of the new Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee models and the new RAM 1500 pick-up truck.
ONE REGION STORY
North America accounted for 97 percent of profit in the quarter and operating profit margins in the region rose to 10.2 percent from 8.0 percent last year as a shift to sell more trucks and SUVs continued to pay off. 
However, the over-reliance on one region worried some. 
""This is now a one region story, unless one believes other parts are ripe for a turnaround,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said. ""While the U.S. delivered spectacularly, the news from elsewhere is not encouraging.""
Both Europe and Asia reported an operating loss. 
FCA's operations in Europe were hit by the transition toward tougher emissions tests which became mandatory from the start of September. 
Chinese market weakness weighed on FCA's performance in Asia and hit sales of luxury brand Maserati. The brand's margins fell to 2.4 percent from 13.8 percent last year. 
Manley said he saw significant upside for Europe in future. 
He also expects progress at Maserati in the second half of next year, adding the product remained competitive but was plagued by issues related to how it was positioned and managed.
FCA expects to take a hit of around 850 million euros from higher steel and aluminum prices this year, and a similar impact in 2019.
Group net profit in the quarter was down 38 percent as FCA set aside 713 million euros to cover potential costs related to talks with U.S. authorities over suspected diesel emissions violations - which FCA denies. The charge does not represent an agreed settlement, nor is an admission of liability, FCA added.
""(This provision) sits someway below most expectations of a figure in excess of 1 billion euros,"" Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 01:54PM ET</span>","General Electric reveals deeper regulatory probe, restructuring","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share, promised to restructure its power unit and said it faced a deeper accounting probe as new Chief Executive Larry Culp took his first steps to revive the struggling conglomerate.
GE said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice had expanded ongoing investigations to include a $22-billion writedown of goodwill from GE's power division, which GE reported on Tuesday.
GE's restructuring of Power comes as the 126-year-old company, once the most valuable U.S. corporation, is reeling from missteps that have eroded profits and forced it to announce more than $40 billion in writedowns in less than a year, among the largest such actions in U.S. corporate history.
Culp, who took over on Oct. 1, delivered more bad news on Tuesday: GE will significantly miss its full-year cash flow target of about $6 billion, and cannot estimate profits for the year until Culp gets more detail about its ailing power unit. 
GE all but eliminated its quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share to conserve $3.9 billion in cash. Analysts viewed that positively, and Culp said there were no plans to raise equity capital, as some analysts had feared.
""My priorities in my first 100 days are positioning our businesses to win, starting with Power, and accelerating deleveraging,"" Culp said in the results statement. 
GE shares were down 8.5 percent at $10.21. They had been up earlier after the results.
NEW POWER STRUCTURE
Former CEO John Flannery, who was on the job for just 14 months, said in June that GE would pare its focus to jet engines, power plants and renewable energy by disposing of its healthcare and Baker Hughes units, along with other restructuring already in the works.
Culp added on Tuesday that GE will put its gas turbine equipment and services businesses in a new unit, a move analysts said likely foreshadows the sale of other power assets, such as steam turbines, nuclear plants and power grids.
GE took on much of that capability in 2015 with a $10-billion acquisition of power assets from  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA. It argued it could boost margins and profits. But profits fell as demand for fossil power plants slowed in response to cheaper solar and wind systems. Power services faced stiff competition in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, and use of large power plants has declined, slowing repair revenue.
GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill because the promised profits from power are now unlikely.
""They are acknowledging that it is not going to turn around in a hurry,"" said Paul Healy, a professor at the Harvard Business School who focuses on corporate financial reporting.
Largely as a result, GE reported a loss of $22.8 billion for the third quarter on Tuesday. The power business lost $631 million in the quarter.
Overall, GE posted a loss of $2.63 a share, compared with 16 cents profit a year ago, on a 4-percent revenue decline to $29.6 billion. Adjusted earnings were 14 cents a share, down from 21 cents a year ago. Analysts had expected 20 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data.
Orders at the power division fell 18 percent and revenue fell 33 percent in the quarter. ""The only way out of this mess is to restructure power,"" said Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research in New York. ""It will bottom eventually.""
GE did not cut its earnings forecast for the year from the most recent $1.00 to $1.07 per share, as some had expected. Analysts have cut estimates for adjusted earnings to 88 cents a share, on average, according to Refinitiv data. A spokeswoman said GE would not hit the old targets, but was not providing new ones just yet.
""I just don't think Larry has his hands around this fully yet, enough to put his stamp of approval on guidance,"" Davis said.

Credit agencies have since cut GE's ratings, increasing its debt costs, and its financial challenges, which have prompted talk that it will issue stock to raise capital, limit the funds GE has to fix its power division, according to analysts.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 12:45PM ET</span>","Israel, Boeing sign reciprocal spending deal: ministry","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) has agreed to spend billions of dollars in Israel over the coming decade if it wins major defense contracts, Israel's Economy Ministry said on Tuesday.
The ""reciprocal procurement"" agreement calls for Boeing to collaborate with Israeli industries for at least 35 percent of the value of any transaction it signs with the Israeli government.
This could ease concerns in Israel over new requirements in a U.S. aid package that divert funds away from local industries.
Boeing is competing in Israel for a number of key Defence Ministry contracts, including the purchase of additional F-15 aircraft, fueling planes and a squadron of transport helicopters, the ministry said.
With Israel expecting to make about $10 billion of military purchases from Boeing over the next decade, the agreement with the U.S. aerospace company means $3.5 billion in new business in Israel, the ministry said in a statement.
""A reciprocal procurement agreement of this magnitude is a significant achievement that will lead to the growth of many companies in the economy, increase their activity and also their success in international markets,"" said Economy Minister Eli Cohen.
Under a defense aid deal signed in 2016 by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then U.S. President Barack Obama, the United States agreed to provide Israel with $38 billion in military assistance over 10 years.

However, one component of the deal was to phase out a special arrangement that had allowed Israel to use 26.3 percent of the U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons. All the aid will now have to be spent on U.S. equipment by 2026.

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock's former head of European fundamental credit is preparing to launch his own hedge fund next year in what is likely to be one of the year's biggest debuts, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Michael Phelps, 43, oversaw $35 billion across a number of credit, leveraged finance and credit alternatives portfolios at BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager.
Tresidor Investment Management will launch in the second quarter and invest across European high-yield bonds, leveraged loans, convertible bonds and sovereign debt, aiming to profit from changes in central bank policy, inflation and diverging financial regimes, one source said.
Credit hedge funds took in $4.8 billion in investor cash between January and September, data from industry tracker eVestment showed, second only to inflows into equity funds.
Tresidor plans to join the exclusive club of funds running more than $1 billion in assets over the medium term and was ""progressing extremely well"" toward the target, one source told Reuters.
Estimates of the fund's size at launch varied, with a second source familiar with the matter suggesting a $750 million start, while a third said it would be closer to $300 million.
In any case, that would likely put Tresidor among the biggest hedge fund launches of the year globally. Of 590 launches in 2018, just four started with more than $300 million in assets under management, data from industry tracker Preqin showed.
""He has a very good reputation and a lot of support,"" one investor said, while a second described him as ""awesome"".
Two hedge fund strategies run by Phelps at BlackRock averaged returns in the high teens while a lower-risk, retail-friendly fund made mid- to high-single-digit percentage gains, the first source said.
A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment on the assets overseen by Phelps or his fund performance during his time at BlackRock.
Tresidor will launch with a team of at least 15 people, one of the sources close to the firm said, an unusually large staff for a start-up, pointing to confidence in the amount of money the firm will have in place.
Few hedge funds with $500 million or less in assets under management employ so many people, with just 15 percent employing between 11 and 20, research from trade body AIMA showed.
Joining Phelps as co-founder and CEO is Edgar Senior, 43, previously at hedge fund Marble Bar Asset Management, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), according to filings with the British regulator.
Mike Srba, whose British regulatory filings show he formerly worked at hedge fund giant Millennium Capital Partners and BlackRock, will also join as a trader, the first source told Reuters.
Phelps declined to comment on the launch.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Airbus says close to delivering first A330-900 to TAP Portugal,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) plans to deliver its delayed A330-900 aircraft to launch customer TAP Portugal ""imminently"", an executive with the European planemaker said on Tuesday.
The 290-seat aircraft is part of the A330neo series - an upgrade of the A330 wide-body jet with new engines designed to blunt sales of the lightweight Boeing 787 (N:BA).
A smaller 250-seat sister plane, the A330-800, is close to staging its first flight, Mark Pearman-Wright, head of leasing and investor marketing at Airbus, added while speaking at the Airline Economics conference in Hong Kong.
Rolls-Royce (L:RR) said last week that it faced production delays with engines for the A330neo.
Airbus and Boeing have been locked in a fierce battle for sales of relatively small wide-body jets like the A330neo, which has been struggling to win orders against the 787 Dreamliner.
Airbus earlier this month said it had won an order from Kuwait Airways for eight A330-800s, which had been left without customers after Hawaiian Airlines defected to the Boeing 787. Some conference delegates said this may have been at the expense of at least part of its pending order for newer A350 aircraft.
""Airbus may be ready to give up a few A350s to keep the A330 going,"" a leasing executive said, asking not to be named.

Airbus has said the replacement cycle for earlier models of A330 aircraft, as they retire, will lift demand for the A330neo. Airbus is relying on the jet to continue a profitable but declining wide-body franchise and to keep commercial depth to an airframe that it needs to keep building for military customers.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 10:46AM ET</span>",Coke profits get health kick in third quarter,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's quarterly revenue and profit topped Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, as investments to cater to changing consumer tastes paid off with higher sales of its sugar-free sodas and vitamin waters.
The world's biggest beverage maker, like rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, has been building a portfolio of non-carbonated drinks and doubling down on its investments in enhanced waters such as electrolyte-filled smartwater.
Coke also paid $5.1 billion for the world's second-largest coffee chain Costa earlier this year and took a stake in Kobe Bryant-backed sports drink BodyArmor in a bid to court a younger demographic that prefers sipping lattes over gulping big sodas.
Chief Executive Officer James Quincey played down media reports in recent weeks that the company is looking at cannabis-infused drinks in North America as a wave of legalization spreads across Canada and some U.S. states.
""We don't have any plans at this stage to get into this space,"" he told a post earnings call with analysts, adding that the pace of acquisitions in the quarter should not be taken as a sign of how the company would proceed from here. 
""M&A of course is not a strategy in and of itself – it's an enabler of our strategy.""
Organic revenue, or sales from its core beverage business, rose 6 percent in the third quarter, led by double-digit volume growth for Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 2 percent in the quarter, roughly stable from a year ago. Carbonated drinks grew 2 percent in the quarter, while water and sports drinks, up just 1 percent in the previous quarter, grew 5 percent.
""(We are) starting to see growth coming back into water as we've done a bit of de-prioritizing and moved more into premium and innovation,"" Quincey said. 
GINGER LIME 
Earlier this year the company launched new slim line Diet Coke cans along with flavors including ginger lime and feisty cherry. It promised earlier this month to introduce two new variants of its smartwater brand on the U.S. West coast.
The strategy, which follows Quincey's appointment last year, has drawn support from Wall Street analysts and investors. 
A 2 percent gain on Tuesday took its shares back into positive territory for this year and compared to a near 6-percent decline for Pepsi and an almost 5- percent drop in the S&P consumer staples index over the same period. 
Net income attributable to the company's shareholders rose 30 percent on the year in the three months ended Sept. 28.
Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it earned 58 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 3 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue fell 9 percent to $8.25 billion, due to the disposal of its low-margin bottling operations, but beat expectations.

""We are impressed with Coca-Cola's ability to deliver a strong and balanced top line, suggesting that its refranchising and portfolio transformation are paying off,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",ING to sell Italian real estate lease portfolio to Goldman: document,"MILAN/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch bank  ING Groep  NV (AS:INGA) plans to sell its remaining Italian real estate leasing portfolio to Goldman Sachs (N:GS) as it continues to cut leasing activities outside its home markets, a document reviewed by Reuters showed.
A letter ING sent to unions in Italy said the group expected to sign the deal by early December and close it in the first quarter of next year. 
The portfolio comprises both performing and non-performing real estate leasing contracts, ING said, adding that the disposal would make 31 people in Italy redundant and inviting unions to discuss possible measures to reduce staff.
ING said it had picked Goldman, which is partnering with Italy's Finanziaria Internazionale (FinInt), after evaluating a number of offers by various credit management specialists.
Also in tandem with FinInt, Goldman in November last year bought an Italian performing lease portfolio worth 483 million euros ($548.83 million), the first such deal in Italy following changes to the law that have made it possible to transfer lease contracts as part of securitization deals.
ING, Goldman and FinInt all declined to comment.
""The long maturity of real estate leasing contracts ... means their financial risk is particularly high and makes it difficult to take actions to lower it, creating uncertainty over future results at ING Bank NV,"" the letter said.
In 2006, ING said its Italian leasing operations had a portfolio of 2.5 billion euros and were the best-performing among ING's lease subsidiaries, with high margins and low risk.
By 2013 the bank had sold several lease portfolios and put the remainder, including the Italian business, in run-off so they could be ""wound down in a controlled manner.""
ING said in its 2017 financial report that rising risk costs related to the Italian lease run-off portfolio had contributed to a sharp drop in its underlying pre-tax result at its ""bank treasury and other"" division.
A spokesman declined to comment on the size of the remaining Italian portfolio or whether it was slated for sale.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 10:24AM ET</span>","Pfizer cuts revenue forecast as supply snags, dollar strength weigh","By Tamara Mathias and Aakash B
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) on Tuesday reported worse-than-expected third quarter revenue and lowered the top end of its full-year sales forecast as generic competition and drug pricing pressure in the United States hurt its older drugs business.
Pfizer said it now expects 2018 revenue of between $53 billion and $53.7 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $53 billion to $55 billion.
Sales of breast cancer medicine Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz, both considered growth-drivers for the company, also disappointed in the quarter and shares of the largest U.S. drugmaker declined 3.2 percent in premarket trading. 
Investor attention has been increasingly focused on the company post-2020, with a view toward drugs they hope will be on the market by then, including the non-opioid pain treatment tanezumab,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said.
However, shareholders are keen to know how the company plans to bridge the gap until 2020 with products such as Ibrance and Xeljanz underperforming this quarter, he added.
Ibrance sales for the quarter of $1.03 billion was below analysts' estimates of about $1.07 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Xeljanz brought in $432 million, also short of estimates of about $476.3 million.
Pfizer, which gets just over half of its revenue from outside the United States, said strengthening of the dollar in relation to the euro and certain emerging market currencies led to diminished revenue projections.
""While we are disappointed by the lowered guidance, we recognize that it was the result of factors unrelated to the company's innovative new product portfolio,"" Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said.
Supply problems at facilities making Pfizer's sterile injectables, as well as competition from cheaper generic medicines in the United States, hit sales at the company's Essential Health business.
Sales from the unit, which Pfizer plans to reorganize into a new division that sells off-patent medicines and generic drugs, fell 4.4 percent to $4.83 billion in the quarter.
Excluding one-time items, Pfizer earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to Refinitiv.
The company said it benefited from a 13.3 percent tax rate on adjusted income, well below the 23.7 percent it paid last year before the U.S. Congress passed a bill that significantly lowered corporate tax rates. 
Net income rose 45 percent to $4.11 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.

Overall revenue for the quarter edged 1 percent higher to $13.30 billion. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion.

947,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Trump Says Stock Market Taking ‘A Little Pause’ Before Midterms,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump attributed declines in leading U.S. stock indexes to “a little pause” as investors wait to see the results of the midterm elections.
“If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!”
Stocks fell on Monday after a Bloomberg News report that the administration would move forward with additional tariffs against China if Trump couldn’t make progress toward resolving its trade dispute during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in early December. Markets have already been under pressure from concerns over rising interest rates and peak earnings growth. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes are on track for the steepest monthly declines of the record-long bull market.
Trump previously blamed the Federal Reserve for stock declines, complaining after the central bank raised its benchmark policy rate three times this year, by a quarter-percentage point on each occasion. In an interview last week with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he “maybe” regretted appointing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Trump said in the interview that Powell “almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates” and that it’s “too early to tell, but maybe” he regrets appointing him.
In his tweet Tuesday, Trump said markets were still “massively up” since his election.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 33 percent since Trump was elected, though has seen a decline of 1.12 percent since the beginning of 2018.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has also argued that politics -- rather than the president’s trade policies -- are to blame for recent market losses. Earlier this month, he told reporters that stocks may be “gyrating” because investors were worried Democrats in Congress would overturn the president’s economic policies.
“Businesses large, medium, and small do not want the tax cut overturned,” Kudlow said.

Short sellers of FAANG stocks, or those investors betting against these shares, have seen $5.52 billion in mark-to-market profits since the beginning of the month, a return of 17.14% on an average short position of $32.2 billion, according to data from S3 Partners, a financial-analytics firm.
Since that time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has plunged 12%, in large part because of the FAANG stocks —  Facebook (-13%),  Apple (-6%),  Amazon (-24%),  Netflix (-26%), and  Google (-15%). 
But traders aren't necessarily betting against names outright, some are doing it for hedging purposes, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics.
""The five FAANG stocks are all in the top ten most shorted U.S. equities which indicates that there are more reasons to short these names besides pure Alpha generation on the short side of a portfolio,"" Dusaniwsky said on Monday.
""While a portion of the short non-Alpha trading can be attributed to option and future hedging, most of the non-Alpha trading is related to portfolio Beta hedging.""
Dusaniwsky added that these short sellers could start to buy back FAANG stocks to cover their positions. 
""When tech rallies again, we will probably see short covering of a larger percentage of the October FAANG short selling activity as the notional dollar short interest increases,"" he said.
""These buy to covers will act as accelerants to any FAANG’s upward price movements, October’s significant increase in shares shorted will increase the potential for some volatile swings to the upside.""

Under Armour shares have been under pressure over the past few years, tumbling as much as 79% from their September 2015 peak.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares labored in the red and China's yuan hit a 10-year low on Tuesday as the prospect of an escalation in the U.S.-Sino trade war compounded the recent gloom in global markets.
Traders reacted by sending the dollar a 2-1/2 month high and lifting futures prices on Wall Street's badly-bruised main markets, which have lost between 7 and 10 percent during this month's turbulence. (N)
Asia had also made modest gains thanks to hints of economic stimulus from Beijing (SS), but European bourses could not maintain the momentum as some disappointing company results and data from France and Italy triggered more caution. (EU) 
The euro wallowed near a 10-week low of 1.1352 too as the dollar climbed to its 2 1/2-month high against a basket of the world's top six currencies. 
It was the 10-year low for China's yuan in Asia that grabbed most attention, though, as it weakened to 6.9696 per dollar, stirring speculation over whether Beijing will tolerate a slide beyond 7 per dollar.
That had came on top of reports that Washington will impose tariffs on all Chinese imports by the end of the year without progress at next month’s meeting of Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, though Trump then said in an interview that a ""great deal"" was still possible with China. 
""We don't see the trade war being resolved any time soon,"" said Rabobank's senior macro strategist Teeuwe Mevissen. ""And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.""
There was more negative news out of Italy, the other major concern for Europe at the moment, as its coalition government faces off with the European Commission over spending. 
Data showed the Italian economy had ground to a halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade flows failed to spur any growth.
The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and renewed the pressure on Italy's government debt in the bond markets.
Italy's 10-year government bond yield was up 2.5 basis points at 3.36 percent, having been as low as 3.32 percent earlier in the session. (IT10YT=RR) The closely watched spread over German government debt was back up to 300 bps. (DE10YT=RR)
Traders were also still digesting the news on Monday that Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel will step down as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics.
Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance, became the first candidate to officially throw their hat into the ring to succeed her on Tuesday. 
GLOBAL BEAR MARKET?
Asia's choppy rise had come as China made a fresh attempt to stabilize its stock markets.
Beijing's securities regulator said it would encourage share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions by listed firms and would enhance market liquidity.
Mainland China's benchmark Shanghai Composite (SSEC) and the blue-chip CSI 300 (CSI300) gained to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, having initially fallen after Trump's administration had hit state-backed Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua with U.S. restrictions on Monday.
Japan's Nikkei average (N225) also erased early losses and rose 1.5 percent as traders went shopping for bargains among beaten-down stocks. (T) 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) has lost 12 percent this month and is on track for its biggest October decline since 2008, during the global financial crisis. 
""At this point, nobody can say the equity market is bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo. 
The speed with which a brief rally in U.S. stocks faded on Monday underscored that jittery mood.
Wall Street was pointing to 0.4-0.5 percent gains later, but the S&P 500 will be starting near a six-month low, having dropped almost 10 percent from last month’s record highs. (N)
The chill around China and global trade means emerging- market stocks are at an 18-month low. MSCI's index is down for a sixth day in a row and Monday's post-election rally in Brazil was already in the rear-view mirror. [EMRG/FRX]
The CBOE Global Markets volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", was down a touch, but it had jumped as high as 27.86 points, its second highest level since a worldwide volatility shock in early February. 
""The probability of global stocks turning to a bear market is increasing,"" said Masanari Takada, cross-assets strategist at Nomura Securities.
In the main commodity markets, oil prices were down after easing overnight as Russia signaled that output will remain high and as concern over the global economy led to worries about demand for crude. 
West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) dropped 1.4 percent to $66.13 per barrel. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 1.8 percent to just under $76.
Zinc and copper prices also buckled, along with other base metals, after U.S. President Trump's warning of new tariffs on Chinese goods.

Trump has said during an interview with Fox News that he thinks there will be ""a great deal"" with China on trade, but said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to go if a deal is not possible.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 09:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo says auto insurance remediation will not wrap up until 2020,"(This version of the story has been refiled to correct date of story)
By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co will not finish paying back the estimated 600,000 customers it wrongly charged for auto insurance until at least 2020, the bank said in a letter to U.S. lawmakers seen by Reuters.
U.S. regulators slapped Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty in April when it admitted to wrongly forcing drivers into auto insurance policies. That agreement envisioned the customer payouts would finish within months. 
""We will be contacting customers and providing them with compensation in multiple stages throughout 2019, with the final stage scheduled for January 2020,"" the bank said in a letter dated Oct. 9 to the Senate Banking Committee's top Republican and Democrat.
As Wells Fargo tries to complete a drawn-out remediation, bank executives are also trying to convince the Federal Reserve to lift a cap on growth put in place due to a string of past sales practice abuses. Bank executives have said they expect the Fed to lift that asset cap by the first part of 2019.
And while the bank disclosed the auto insurance issue in July 2017, the amount it expects to pay back customers has grown.
In August, Wells Fargo said that it expected to pay back drivers $212 million. The bank had originally estimated it would pay out $64 million in cash remediation when it disclosed the problems. 
Drivers who bought a car through Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for ""force-place"" policies. The bank enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, regulators have said.
“We regret how this issue impacted our customers. We are finalizing our remediation plan, which is designed to provide each customer with appropriate compensation for their individual circumstances. We look forward to providing our customers with the full compensation they deserve,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said. 
Wells Fargo plans to automatically refund insurance for drivers in five states but will require drivers in other states to prove that they are entitled to a rebate, according to the letter.
State law in Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Tennessee and Washington demands that drivers be given a chance to dispute force-place policies before they are charged and Wells Fargo said it will presume drivers in those states were wronged.
But drivers in other states must submit evidence that they were pushed into unneeded insurance before Wells Fargo will consider a complete refund, according to the letter to Republican Senator Mike Crapo, from Idaho, and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, from Ohio.
Wells Fargo promised to repay customers under a $1 billion settlement the bank reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April.
But regulators rejected the bank's payout plan this summer and told Wells Fargo it must do more to make sure that it can find and repay everyone who was overcharged, Reuters reported in September. 
Customers who were charged for unneeded insurance could face overdraft fees, damaged credit or vehicle repossession. As part of its settlement agreement, Wells Fargo had to review several years' worth of bank and insurance paperwork for those customers.

In the letter, Wells Fargo said it will make ""appropriate adjustments"" to consumer credit scores that might have been hurt by the improper insurance.

The company's shares rose 2.1 percent to $195 in premarket trading.
Consumer confidence has been rising, with levels hitting their highest in 18 years last month. That, coupled with higher wages, led to an overall growth in purchasing power, benefiting companies like Mastercard and its bigger peer, Visa.
Mastercard's gross dollar volume, which refers to the dollar value of transactions processed, rose 9 percent to $1.47 trillion in the quarter.
Rising oil prices during the quarter also helped lift the gross dollar volumes for payments processors. Benchmark Brent crude oil price (LCOc1) rose 7 percent in the reported quarter.
The Purchase-New York based company processed 23.12 billion transactions worldwide in the quarter, up 19.2 percent. Its customers had issued 2.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, as of Sept. 30.
Net income climbed to a record $1.90 billion, or $1.82 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.43 billion, or $1.34 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.78 per share, trouncing estimates of $1.68 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The company's net revenue jumped 14.7 percent to $3.90 billion.

963,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:51AM ET</span>",Democrats Gaining Ground in Midterms Won’t Be Bad News for Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- With Democrats likely to take control of the U.S. House in midterm elections, analysts expect some near-term pressure on bank stocks but say it won’t be all bad news.
Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) at the helm of the Financial Services Committee might seek to return attention to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s misdeeds. Some also expect fresh calls to break up the biggest banks. Even so, most market watchers anticipate President Donald Trump’s efforts to ease bank rules will continue, as his regulators are firmly in place.
That’s good for banks, which have outperformed the broader market since Trump’s 2016 election victory. It may not be enough to boost their stocks, as easier rules, tax cuts and fiscal spending may already be priced in. Still, Veda Partners’ Henrietta Treyz said the very passing of the election itself will eliminate uncertainty and could help shares rise.
Republicans are forecast to retain control of the Senate. Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote that gridlock in Congress would mean bank regulators continue “to advance proposals to moderate the existing regime.” That’s why Cowen is still “overall positive” on the sector from a policy perspective, especially for regional banks. The risk for big banks, Seiberg said, “remains tied to populist anger.”
Capital Alpha’s Ian Katz is skeptical a Democratic House could change much, as long as the Senate stays Republican. Waters at the Financial Services Committee could ask for hearings on Wells Fargo,  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX). and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s financial ties to President Trump, but “the House alone won’t be able to follow through.”
Katz added that a close look at the House races shows a large percentage of the 2019 freshman class may be centrists -- not “‘let’s-blow-up-the-place’ Socialists.”
Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky expects “a legislative logjam"" with a divided Congress, along with “a forceful oversight agenda in the House, a steady pace of confirmations in the Senate, and a slow lurch from deadline to deadline on Capitol Hill.”
Whichever way the House goes, Boltansky sees little chance for overhauling the mortgage finance system, though there may be a chance for administrative change at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Trump administration “has already engaged the regulatory gears,” with Trump appointees controlling nine of 10 key agencies, Height Capital Markets’ Ed Groshans said in an email. A Democratic majority House might create “headline risks” for large institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Capital One and U.S. Bancorp due to hearings, but any House-passed legislation would likely die in a Republican Senate.
If Republicans retain control of the House and Senate, Groshans said large financial institutions would benefit from perceptions Republicans are more sympathetic to big banks. On the flip side, a “Blue Wave” would trigger investor fears Democrats are less sympathetic. But, there’s little real policy risk for the sector even under a Democratic sweep, he said.
If Republicans hold the House, the most significant consequence may be further presidential criticism of the Federal Reserve, Redburn’s Melissa Kidd and Clemmie Elwes wrote in a note. They think that could push the Fed to opt for more tightening, forcing banks to struggle to optimize the benefits of higher rates while curbing the impact on credit and deposit costs.

964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",How $1 Trillion May End Up Being a Sign of the Top: Taking Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- A truly troubling start to the week, to say the least.
Monday’s ~103-handle reversal from the day’s peak was the widest intraday range we’ve seen on the S&P 500 since the meltdown began earlier this month.
The TICK index, a measure of NYSE stocks trading on a downtick versus an uptick, printed a -1734 at 3:42pm and coincided with a jarring plunge in the SPX followed by a near 40-handle bounce in the last 15 minutes of the session. That makes it twice this month (see graphic below) that massive programs mimicked the sell orders seen during the ""Flash Crash"" in May 2010.
This is not anywhere close to normal, although I won’t hesitate to point out that 1) stocks rallied incessantly for eight-plus years after the ""Flash Crash,"" and 2) the S&P 500 reversed on Monday the second that it got within a few points of its long-term support at ~2,600, which is a level tested successfully multiple times this year, as the chart below shows.
That said, the selling that we’ve experienced all month appears more orderly than what we saw during the early Feb. machine-driven breakdown, which lasted just over a week and was more volatility-driven than anything else.
This time around, we have a much larger laundry list of macro worries from a global growth slowdown to the deteriorating situation with the trade war (like our report yesterday that tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports may be announced in early December) that has led to a giant rotation out of growth stocks and the bull market winners and into value and any sector deemed defensive.
$1 Trillion Top?
Tech stocks bled for most of Monday’s session, as they have all month -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have now sank more than 23% month-to-date while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are both down 14% -- as IBM’s $33 billion splash to establish a bigger footprint in the cloud didn’t appear to come close to solidifying any sort of support for momentum stocks (MTUM ETF sank as much as 3.2% at one point on Monday).
Facebook reports tonight, and perhaps they’ll be able to give the bulls something to cheer about, which is not an easy task given that the stock has now firmly broken below its Cambridge Analytica-scandal lows from March. Or perhaps it won’t matter as money continues to come out of the FAANG complex, especially from those that have already printed results.
The only member of the FAANGs left to report after Facebook is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is starting to look precarious as its shares are quickly stumbling back to the $1 trillion market cap level after initially smashing the milestone almost three months ago.
If Apple disappoints in any way, or gets swept up in the wave of tech selling thereafter, then I’d imagine a consensus ""This Is the Top"" opinion forming for the broader market. If that scenario ends up playing out, then Apple passing the $1 trillion mark and the talk of who would be next (Amazon or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now at ~$750 billion and ~$800 billion, respectively) will forever be remembered as perhaps the most momentous sign of the top to this nine-and-a-half year bull market. IBM’s desperate scramble to snag Red Hat won’t be too far behind, though.
Sectors in Focus Today
Notes From the Sell Side
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) upgrades Nvidia to an overweight after the stock’s 34% plunge month-to-date, which is double the selloff in the SOX; they say investors are underestimating gaming demand strength near term and expect ""outsized growth and clear leadership"" in both Gaming and Datacenter/HPC segments over the next few years.
JPMorgan is also out on the airlines, arguing that the case for industry margin expansion remains the best they’ve seen in four years: ""Most stocks are within 10% of their autumnal lows, suggesting seasonal trade-winds may lift equities as they often do."" But then they add that they ""can’t ignore the market’s recent de-rating of nearly two multiple turns,"" and so they make four rating changes as a result -- Upgrading JetBlue to overweight, downgrade Southwest to an underweight, and cut both United and Spirit to neutral.
BofAML is out on the transports, double upgrading Old Dominion Freight to a buy (""quality of business too good to ignore""), raising XPO Logistics to a buy after the pullback (reports earnings Wednesday post-market), and downgrading ArcBest to an underperform on cycle risk (reports Thursday post-market). The firm is also downgrading auto parts retailer Genuine Parts to an underperform as its left with an unloved asset (its office products division whose spinout to Essendant was terminated) that reduces the company’s margin and growth profile.
And  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) tries to explain the brutal selling in defense stocks yesterday (L3 Tech -8.8%, Lockheed -6%, Northrop -5%, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) -4.8%), citing growing talk of budget declines for FY2020 and an unwind of well-owned stocks within the broader industrials universe as the most likely factor. Investors were ""surprised for sure"" by the magnitude of the selloff, though adds that Northrop management was constructive on their outlook at a dinner.

The Oklahama-based oil and natural gas producer said each WildHorse shareholder will get either 5.989 shares of Chesapeake common stock, or a combination of 5.336 shares of Chesapeake stock and $3 in cash, for each share they hold.
WildHorse's shares surged 13.5 percent to $20.50 in premarket trading, while Chesapeake shares slumped 8 percent to $3.42.
The acquisition is expected to give Chesapeake about 420,000 high-margin net acres in the Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk formations in Southeast Texas, and help it save between $200 million and $280 million in annual costs.
Chesapeake has been directing its capital toward oil production and shifting away from natural gas amid a rise in crude prices and a slump in natural gas prices.
""We plan to focus the vast majority of our projected 2019 activity on our high-margin, higher-return oil opportunities in the PRB and Eagle Ford Shale, while decreasing capital and activity directed toward our natural gas portfolio,"" Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler said in a statement.
Chesapeake also reported third-quarter results on Tuesday, which showed a net profit of $60 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $41 million a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 19 cents per share. Wall Street analysts on average had expected 15 cents, according to Refinitiv data. It was not immediately clear if the figures were comparable.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Short-seller Left to seek investor money for fund,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research whose bets against companies from electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC) made him one of Wall Street's most prominent short-sellers, is ready to put investors' money where his mouth is.
After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades, Left is speaking to potential investors about launching Citron Capital, his first-ever hedge fund, that will begin trading in weeks, he told Reuters in an interview. The move could give Left more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies.
While Left will continue to bet against companies, he said he will use the new fund to also bet that some companies' shares will rise.
""If you find the right thing, it is always the right time for short activism,"" Left said. ""Fads, frauds and fading businesses are a constant even in rising markets,"" he added.
Left, whose scathing reports on companies routinely send stock prices reeling, said he plans to raise ""a few hundred million of dollars"" from investors. He is expected to put in $10 million of his own money toward the fund, according to an investor presentation reviewed by Reuters.
Potential investors will be required to invest a minimum of $2 million, leave their money locked up for one year, and pay standard hedge fund industry fees of a 1.5 percent management fee plus a 20 percent cut of the profits to Left, according to the investor prevention.
Left is launching his fund as the stock market has sold off and investors are worrying about frothy valuations of many companies. He is also starting up just as some other prominent long-short equity hedge fund managers are going out of business.
The S&P 500 ended trading on Monday just shy of confirming its second correction of 2018, hurt by fresh worries of an escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions and a sharp drop in big tech and internet names.
Left has started meeting with wealthy investors such as family offices, and said he wished he had launched his new fund six weeks ago, before the stock market began tanking.
Left, 48, who has spent the last 17 years running Citron Research, has earned millions by putting money behind his calls on companies. He earned an average annualized return of 89.98 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to the investor presentation seen by Reuters.
Calling himself a contrarian who is not afraid to speak up or change his mind, Left made news last week when he changed his tune on Tesla. Left said in a research note that the company's Model 3 sedan is a ""proven hit,"" and that serious competition from other automakers for the plug-in car market had not materialized. He attributed his change of heart to a better understanding of the electric car industry and said he believed Tesla had turned the corner.
THE SHORTS SHINE
So-called activist shareholders such as William Ackman and Nelson Peltz publish research to pressure companies to improve shareholder value, by taking actions such as boosting profits or putting a company up for sale. ""Short"" activist shareholders like Left, on the other hand, seek to persuade other shareholders to dump their stock on the basis that a company's flaws have not been priced in by the market.
The average activist hedge fund's returns are roughly flat through the end of September, Hedge Fund Research data show. Several short activist hedge funds, on the other hand, have thrived.
Eiad Asbahi's Prescience Point Capital Management is boasting gains of roughly 47 percent in the first nine months of this year after it alleged accounting fraud at trucking company Celadon, which is currently being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. Sahm Adrangi’s Kerrisdale Capital, which made its reputation by betting against Chinese internet companies, was up 45 percent through the end of September. Ben Axler's Spruce Point Capital and Carson Block's Muddy Waters, which specialize in spotting corporate frauds, are delivering double-digit returns of roughly 18 percent, investors said.
Now that investors are looking for assets uncorrelated to the stock market, short activists are beginning to pull in fresh money. ""By publishing our research (against a company) we lay out a more differentiated case and we find that to be more productive,"" Axler said.
Left said he had several investment ideas for his fund and not all will be shorts.
""I think Wayfair Inc is way over-valued. I would be long on China,"" Left said, adding that stocks like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and JD.com have bright futures.
""For me, this is in my blood and I feel like I have another good 15 years left,"" Left said.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Sony forecasts big jump to record annual profit on winning gaming strategy,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758) boosted its annual profit outlook by 30 percent to a record level after a strong second-quarter, propelled by popular game titles like ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" as well as growing demand for its online gaming services.
The results are a vindication of a strategic shift by the entertainment and electronics firm to build up more content-oriented businesses like gaming, which generate recurring revenue and are less susceptible to the earnings ups and downs seen in consumer electronics.
""Sony has become, more than most people realize, a company that generates profit through content. Until just a few years ago, the worry was always that it was going to revise down on hardware woes but now it has transformed to generate stable earnings,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Securities.
Sony now expects annual operating profit of 870 billion yen ($7.7 billion), a level that comfortably beats market expectations of 796 billion yen. The gaming business will be the biggest profit driver generating 310 billion yen.
Big gaming hits exclusive to Sony have offset declining sales for its mainstay PlayStation 4 console, now five years old. 
Action-adventure title ""God of War"" sold 3.1 million copies in the first three days of its release in April, the fastest sales rate of any PlayStation first-party title in history. The record was renewed just five months later, when ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" was released in September and sold 3.3 million in its first three days. 
""We've been very blessed with some blockbuster titles,"" Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing. ""The lineup will remain strong in the second half of the year.""
Its PlayStation Plus subscription-based service has also seen steady growth in subscriber numbers while in the Japanese mobile gaming market, role playing game ""Fate/Grand Order"" published by a unit of Sony's music division continued to deliver a strong performance. 
In the second-quarter, operating income climbed 17 percent to 239.5 billion yen. Profit for its gaming division surged 65 percent.
Sony also raised its annual profit forecast for its semiconductor division, which includes imaging sensors, by 17 percent to 140 billion yen.
Although the global smartphone market is maturing, demand for Sony's image sensors has remained healthy as phone manufacturers introduce multiple-lens camera systems for high-end models.
Sony now aims to invest 600 billion yen in imaging sensors over the three years through March 2021, up by 20 percent from its previous goal and accounting for half of the group's planned capital expenditures.
Sony controls more than half of the imaging sensor market for smartphones, with customers including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and most other major handset makers.
Meanwhile, Sony's own smartphone handset business was one of few weak spots in the robust earnings as the firm is now bracing for a loss of 95 billion yen for this financial year and expects the business to return to profit only in the year from April 2020.
""We'll scale down the business further to minimize risks,"" Totoki said, but added that the company had no intention of exiting the business entirely.
Also on Tuesday, domestic gaming peer Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) said sales of Switch consoles and games pushed operating profit up 30 percent in the July-September period to reach the firm's highest quarterly result in eight years.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares swung back into negative territory on Tuesday after a strong start, buckling under the weight of disappointing earnings updates as strains rippled through the airline, banking and construction sectors.
The leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E) was down 0.4 percent by 0930 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.6 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) climbed 0.1 percent. 
Trading was fraught after the past fortnight saw heavy losses that left the pan-European STOXX 600 near a 22-month low. 
U.S. stocks were hit on Monday by a report that Washington plans to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports if no progress is made in talks between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. 
Though risk appetite revived slightly in Asian trading after Beijing made a fresh attempt to stabilize the country's markets, Europe's early rally quickly evaporated.
""There were disappointing profits from Lufthansa as well as  Beiersdorf  and Reckitt, which together are not a good look,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. 
Companies continued to flag cost pressures and difficulties in the construction sector.
 Geberit  (S:GEBN) shares were the worst performing, falling 9.1 percent after the Swiss plumbing supplies provider cut its sales outlook and said it was more cautious about the building industry.
UBS analysts said sales had slowed to ""near stagnation"" and that Geberit's margin is ""not fully resilient to wage/raw material inflation and FX"". 
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares tumbled 8.9 percent to a 17-month low after the German airline missed profit estimates for the third quarter and said it would raise its number of flights more modestly than peers this season.
It was the latest airline to warn of higher fuel costs biting into profits.
""A slight shortfall in the Q3 results could be forgiven but we expect attention to focus on deteriorating trends in unit revenues and unit costs,"" wrote Liberum analysts. 
Beiersdorf (DE:BEIG), which owns cosmetics brands Nivea and La Prairie, fell 2.5 percent after sales missed expectations and its rival Reckitt Benckiser also reported weaker sales.
Bank stocks also fell after results. 
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) shares were bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5 percent after France's biggest listed bank reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter revenues, blaming its corporate and investment banking arms and its European retail banks.
Its fixed income, currencies and commodities segment saw its lowest performance since 2013, Jefferies analysts said, due to low rates activity and a ""cautious approach to FX"", particularly in emerging markets.
Denmark's  Jyske Bank  (CO:JYSK) was bottom of the STOXX 600, down 9.8 percent after its profit missed expectations.
Analysts have cut their earnings expectations for banks - the worst-performing European sector this year - to the lowest since Feb 2016. 
Strong earnings from  BP  and Volkswagen were the bright spots, helping limit losses. A beneficiary of higher crude costs, BP (L:BP) jumped 4.2 percent after the oil major's profits soared to a five-year high.
Its gains boosted the oil & gas sector index (SXEP) up 0.5 percent.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) topped the DAX with a 2.5 percent gain after the carmaker's profit beat forecasts - bucking the trend in the autos sector hurt by slower car sales and more stringent anti-emissions regulations.
 Genmab  (CO:GEN) was another strong gainer, up 6.2 percent after positive results for a phase 3 MAIA study of its Daratumumab drug.

Like the rest of the sector, the Volkswagen-owned brand, which builds roughly 11,000 vehicles at a northern English plant in Crewe, is worried about duties and 10 percent tariffs under World Trade Organization terms. 
""Best case, it's an annoying impact on our annual profitability,"" Hallmark told Reuters. ""Worst case, it's quite damaging on our annual profitability so a full no deal Brexit would hurt us as a company, it would limit ability to invest."" 
London and Brussels hope to strike a Brexit agreement next month but Hallmark said if there was no deal by the end of the year, the automaker would have to consider stockpiling more and closing its plant for a few extra days to handle any disruption. 
""We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,"" he said. 
Britain's overwhelmingly foreign-owned automotive industry employs more than 850,000 people and has been vocal about the benefits of keeping free and unfettered trade as thousands of cars, engines and parts move to and from the continent daily.
The country's largest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost it 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) per year whilst Mini has moved its annual shutdown to April, just after Britain leaves the bloc. 
Aston Martin is even considering flying in car components if there are snarl-ups on motorways to and from Dover, prompting many, including Bentley, to consider other ports to help avoid delays. 
Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will get a good deal for the industry with her Chequers plan, which has faced stiff opposition from many in her party, promising a common rulebook for goods with the EU to avoid disruption. 
ELECTRIFICATION
While having to adapt to the uncertainties around Brexit, car firms are also preparing to provide electric and hybrid models as stricter air quality rules come into place and governments increasingly penalize the use of combustion engines. 
Hallmark, who took over as chief executive in February, is trying to make the brand's range more environmentally-friendly and presented his plan to the board earlier this year. 
""It was taking stock of all the models, all the powertrains, all the future technologies that we needed to invest in and re-cut the plan to be more electrified than we were,"" he said.
Bentley expects to near a record 11,089 sales this year despite having faced delays to the arrival of its Continental GT model and the challenge of re-certifying some vehicles due to stricter emissions rules.
It posted an 80 million-euro loss in the first six months of the year and will remain in the red for its full-year performance, Hallmark said.
It also faces a decision within about a year over developing its first pure-electric vehicle which it hopes could be available by mid way through the next decade.
""When is the first full-electric Bentley? That is currently in the decision process but our target is definitely before 2025.""

Baer, Switzerland's third-largest private bank, was charged in 2016 with helping wealthy Americans to dodge tax, resulting in a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that required it to steer clear of wrongdoing for three years to ensure that the charges were eventually dismissed.
On Monday Matthias Krull, 44, a German national who is a former Julius Baer Panama vice-chairman, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty in August for his role in a billion-dollar scheme to launder money embezzled from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.
A U.S. court also fined Krull $50,000 and ordered him to forfeit $600,000.
""Mr Krull is a former employee who has been sentenced to charges brought against him in his personal capacity. The bank is not charged of any wrongdoing,"" a Julius Baer spokesman said in response to an enquiry. 
""The charges brought against Mr Krull are not related to the matters covered in the bank's DPA and we have no indication that these events will have any impact on the DPA.""
As part of his plea, Krull admitted that in his position with the Swiss bank he attracted private clients, particularly from Venezuela, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said. 
Krull's clients included a suspect who was indicted on U.S. money laundering charges in August and three unnamed conspirators described in the indictment, it added. 
The DoJ said Krull joined a conspiracy to launder $1.2 billion of funds embezzled from PDVSA via Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:57AM ET</span>",U.S. restricts exports to Chinese semiconductor firm Fujian Jinhua,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration took action on Monday to cut off a Chinese state-backed chipmaker from U.S. suppliers amid allegations the firm stole intellectual property from U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).
The Commerce Department said it had put Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd on a list of entities that cannot purchase components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms.
The administration is concerned the Chinese firm could flood the market with cheap chips that are also made by U.S. companies that supply the U.S. military. If the U.S. chipmakers go out of business, the military would lose a supplier for an item that must come from the United States.
Trade experts said the Trump administration's move may be an unprecedented effort to use a legal tool known for punishing foreign companies that send U.S.-origin goods to sanctioned countries such as Iran to instead protect the economic viability of a U.S. firm.
The move escalated what until now had been a business dispute into the realm of an international trade conflict between the United States and China. The Commerce Department spokesman said the move was ""based on the regulatory standard.""
The action against Fujian Jinhua is likely to ignite new tensions between Beijing and Washington since the company is at the heart of the ""Made in China 2025"" program to develop new high-technology industries.
The world's top two economies are already waging a tariff war over their trade disputes, with U.S. duties in place on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and Chinese duties on $110 billion of U.S. goods.
Fujian Jinhua makes so-called DRAM, the memory chips that make computers, phones and other devices run more quickly and smoothly.
Micron, a maker of memory chips with factories in Virginia and Utah, has accused Fujian Jinhua and Taiwanese partner United Microelectronics Corp of stealing its chip designs in a lawsuit in California. In turn, the companies countersued Micron in China, where courts sided with them and banned some of Micron's chips in China.
""When a foreign company engages in activity contrary to our national security interests, we will take strong action to protect our national security,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
A Commerce Department spokesman said the agency would review any appeal by Fujian Jinhua.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang referred specific questions on the case to the Commerce Ministry, which has yet to comment.
But, in principle, the Chinese government has always asked Chinese companies to strictly follow local laws when they operate overseas, and asks foreign governments to provide fair treatment to Chinese firms, Lu added.
'ENTITY LIST'
The action is similar to a Commerce Department move that nearly put Chinese telecommunications equipment company ZTE Corp (HK:0763) out of business earlier this year by cutting it off from U.S. suppliers.
Linley Gwennap, a chip expert and president of the Linley Group, said Fujian Jinhua was a relatively new company building DRAM as part of China's larger plan to become self-sufficient at making such chips.
He said suppliers such as Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT),  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) and KLA-Tencor Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC) were likely supplying equipment to Fujian Jinhua.
""It's pretty much impossible to build a leading-edge fab (semiconductor plant) without buying equipment from these American companies,"" Gwennap said.
On an earnings call on Monday, KLA-Tencor Chief Executive Rick Wallace said the company expected no financial impact in 2018 or 2019 from the move.
Neither of the other companies that Gwennap named immediately returned a request for comment.
The use of the ""entity list"" - which governs what companies U.S. firms can do business with - to protect the economic viability of a U.S. industry appears to be unprecedented, said Washington trade lawyer Douglas Jacobson.
“This appears to be a dramatic expansion of the use of the entity list for economic purposes,” he said, explaining that the entity list had traditionally been used to prevent imminent violations of U.S. export control laws.

The carmaker's adjusted operating profit came to 3.51 billion euros ($4 billion) in the three months through September, better than the 3.21 billion euros predicted in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages.
It affirmed on Tuesday its target for 2018 operating return on sales before special items at both the group and its passenger cars business area of 6.5 to 7.5 percent.
Including special items, such as an 800 million euros fine against VW's premium brand Audi, the adjusted operating margin will fall moderately short of the expected range, it said.
""The fact that VW does not have to change its forecast makes it look more robust than most of its competitors, namely Daimler and BMW, it demonstrates VW’s talents in both the product and the cost side,"" Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper said.
Shares in Volkswagen rose 4.9 percent to 149.42 euros in early trade, making them the biggest gainers on Germany's blue-chip DAX index.
Volkswagen has struggled to adapt its fleet to the worldwide harmonized light vehicle test procedure, known as WLTP which took effect last month, resulting in a 3.6 percent decline in deliveries during the quarter as some car models remained unavailable for sale.
Volkswagen is also still feeling the impact of its 2015 diesel emissions scandal that has rewritten the rules for the car industry in many major markets.
Analysts at NordLB said the carmaker could still face penalties and fines of up to 20 billion euros tied to its diesel cheating scandal.
NordLB and Metzler reiterated their ""buy"" ratings on Volkswagen's stock.

Despite the new WLTP rules, VW said it expects new vehicle sales to rise moderately this year, after delivering 10.74 million vehicles to customers in 2017.($1 = 0.8794 euros)

988,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Defense firms see only hundreds of new U.S. jobs from Saudi mega deal,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Every time President Donald Trump mentions the $110 billion arms deal he negotiated with Saudi Arabia last year, he quickly follows up, saying ""It's 500,000 jobs.""
But if he means new U.S. defense jobs, an internal document seen by Reuters from  Lockheed Martin  forecasts fewer than 1,000 positions would be created by the defense contractor, which could potentially deliver around $28 billion of goods in the deal.
Graphic: U.S. weapons deliveries to Saudi Arabia - https://tmsnrt.rs/2JgvPkq
Lockheed instead predicts the deal could create nearly 10,000 new jobs in Saudi Arabia, while keeping up to 18,000 existing U.S. workers busy if the whole package comes together - an outcome experts say is unlikely.
A person familiar with Raytheon's planning said if the Saudi order were executed it could help to sustain about 10,000 U.S. jobs, but the number of new jobs created would be a small percentage of that figure. 
Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) declined to comment on the Saudi package. Raytheon Co's Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien said last week that hiring overall is growing, but he did not pin it to any particular program.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jobs are important to Trump. He campaigned on his ability to create American jobs, especially high-paying manufacturing ones. Meanwhile he has limited his criticism of Saudi leadership over the killing of a prominent critic because he did not want to endanger the massive arms deal.
Trump's 500,000 figure has been greeted with widespread skepticism given the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, who make nearly every item on the Saudi list, now employ 383,000 people.
Documents seen by Reuters and interviews with defense industry sources familiar with the arms package suggest that between 20,000 and 40,000 current U.S. defense industry workers could be involved in Saudi-bound production if the whole $110 billion package goes through. 
Existing workers typically are experienced, skilled, who can be redeployed more easily than new hires who would require significant upfront investment in their training.
One significant caveat to any predictions on job creation is whether all of the missile defenses and radars, ships, tanks, software, bombs and other equipment listed in the full Saudi package get delivered.
SAUDI ARABIA JOBS
Interviews with people familiar with other major defense contractors' plans and estimates reflect similar dynamic as Lockheed's and Raytheon's plans - relatively minor additions to their U.S. workforce and more significant build-up in Saudi Arabia.
Since Trump's trip to the Kingdom last year, little economic activity has taken place beyond Lockheed's work on four frigates the Saudis have ordered.
The order will yield nearly 10,000 jobs in the Saudi ports for maintenance workers, but only 500 new U.S. jobs will be created, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Executives at the several of top U.S. defense companies say Riyadh had wanted much of the military equipment as a way to both develop new domestic industry and to create new jobs and local expertise as a part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative to wean the country off oil dependency.
Saudi Arabia has set a goal of creating 40,000 defense industry jobs by 2030. 
The arms package Trump announced in May 2017 came under renewed scrutiny after the Oct. 2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing provoked international outrage and both the administration and defense contractors have been working to prevent a backlash that could imperil what Trump has called a ""tremendous order"" and 500,000 jobs.
Industry executives have argued that without the Saudi package coming through they would have fewer orders to fill, but robust U.S. defense budgets, which account for the majority of their sales, coupled with a record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers would face layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize.
Certainly for each defense manufacturing job, other adjacent jobs are supported indirectly by higher demand for defense products.
But Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research fellow at the Political Economy Research Institute, estimated that for this type of industry the highest multiplier would be just below 3.2. Given that, 20,000 to 40,000 sustained or new jobs could generate between about 64,000 to 128,000 jobs in related industries, Reuters calculations show, bringing the total of sustained and new jobs to between 84,000 and 168,000.
In short, 500,000 jobs Trump keeps bringing up is at least three to five times higher than what one could expect from the Saudi deal, given the estimates from the companies themselves, plus the most generous use of the indirect multiplier.

By its own math, the U.S. State Department said in May 2017 that the Saudi deal could support ""tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.""

989,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",British regulator says company annual reports need a makeover,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Company annual reports are far too long and need a makeover to better serve investors in the digital age, Britain's Financial Reporting Council said on Tuesday.
Despite attempts to streamline company reports by ditching ""boilerplate"" or generic disclosures, some have swollen to several hundred pages, making them harder for investors to navigate and digest.
""We are getting to the stage where the concept of the annual report is at breaking point,"" said Paul George, the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) executive director of corporate governance and reporting.
The FRC polices how companies comply with corporate governance codes.
""There are lots of people out there who believe the annual report is too long and a document that is struggling to have an identity,"" George said.
The watchdog said it was launching a project to challenge existing thinking in corporate reporting and called for participants to join an advisory group by mid-November.
The different types of corporate communications from companies will also be examined.
The FRC will publish its thinking and any suggestions in the second half of next year, which may need legislation to implement. It may set out ideas before then as they emerge to aid discussion.
George said the mantra at the FRC has been for the annual report to tell the story of the company and where it's headed.
The project will look at the purpose of an annual report at a time of rapid advances in how technology delivers information to investors, such as via apps on smartphones.
""New models for corporate reporting will inevitably lead to consideration of how audit and assurance models will need to evolve to respond to the changes,"" George said.
The FRC suggested in the past that companies should not have to publish the annual report in physical form, but was met with a barrage of complaints.
""That is something that needs exploring. I don't know today how many shareholders elect to carry on receiving a hard copy of the annual report,"" George said.

Through the May deal Ocado will ratchet up its delivery business with the construction of robotically operated warehouses for Kroger, upping the ante in the battle with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Ocado said the new agreement includes how Kroger will order warehouses, or what Ocado calls Customer Fulfilment Centres (CFCs), and the basis on which Ocado will develop and operate those sites in the United States.
Kroger is expected to order 20 CFCs over the first three years of the agreement, and order the first three CFCs by the end of 2018.
Ocado did not disclose the location of the first three sites but said details will be made public by Kroger in several weeks.
The target is for Kroger's CFCs to go live within approximately two years of each order being placed.
Ocado said the terms and fee structure of the Kroger deal are similar to those for its other transactions to-date combining up-front fees and ongoing capacity fees.
As with previous deals, Ocado has agreed to install and maintain modules of Mechanical Handling Equipment (MHE) sufficient to provide an agreed level of throughput.
Ocado expects the earnings impact of the deal to be neutral in full year 2018 and said the expected peak cumulative net capital outflow of the initial three CFCs was 90 million pounds ($116 million). It has over 500 million pounds of financing headroom.

Xiaomi was one of several internet firms named in the annual inspection by China's Ministry of Finance. Other firms include e-commerce giant Suning.Com Co Ltd and online game developer Wuhu Shunrong Sanqi Interactive Entertainment Network Technology Co Ltd.
Xiaomi's stock was down 4 percent on Tuesday morning.
The ministry in its report said Xiaomi had made tax errors on corporate gifts and had incorrectly recorded some corporate costs. The document noted that the firm has already rectified the errors.
It also noted that other companies had made efforts to evade taxes by shifting their profits overseas.
A Xiaomi spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
The rebuke comes as the company is facing teething issues following its much-anticipated listing in July. Its stock is down more than 30 percent since the initial public offering (IPO) amid a wider sell off of China tech stocks that has also affected peers  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd. 
It also comes as China is making revisions to its tax code and cracking down on evasion in a wide-scale cleanup that ensnared A-list movie star Fan Bingbing among others.

Despite its tumbling price, Xiaomi has reported healthy smartphone sales in 2018. Earlier this month it said it has already surpassed its full-year sales goal of 100 million handsets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Tuesday it will offer faster checkout at its stores and easier navigation with digital maps indicating exact locations of products, as it gears up to grab a larger share of shoppers' gift budgets this holiday season.
The retailer is also comfortable with the amount of inventory it has in stock, said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer at Walmart. Online sales suffered during the same period last year when Walmart added more holiday merchandise like electronics, toys and gifts, but did not stock enough everyday items.
Walmart announced its plans for the November and December holiday shopping season at a media briefing. The last two months of the year are critical for retailers, when they book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits.
Walmart's new ""Check out with Me"" feature will allow customers to bypass the checkout lines and pay for items in the product department where they are shopping.
The company will also stock a broader assortment of toys, electronics, fashion and home products in its stores and on its revamped website, which the retailer is hoping will boost sales.
Walmart has added over 2,000 brands online, Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer, Walmart e-commerce, U.S., told reporters. Content on the website will range from a new deals hub to gift guides and the monthly Ellen's List from talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, he said.
Walmart will also offer free-two day shipping on orders over $35. This will qualify millions of items it sells directly to shoppers and products that are sold by its third-party marketplace sellers.
Rival  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) one-upped rivals last week when it announced it will offer free two-day shipping on items from Nov. 1 to Dec. 22 with no order minimum or membership.
In August, Walmart said it significantly increased the selection of toys in its stores and online for the holiday season. It added 30 percent more new toys to its stores and expanded its online selection by 40 percent.
Bratspies said the company has permanently expanded space to stock toys in 235 stores this year after the collapse of Toys R Us.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","U.S. go-go growth stock days are gone, value back in play","By Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One undeniable fact has underpinned the latest leg of the long-running U.S. bull market: Paying up for growth stocks at any price paid off, hugely.
Paying a premium for shares of fast-growing companies like Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) over those viewed as good value for the money has been a recipe for success for more than five years. Growth stocks have beaten their value rivals by a margin of more than two-for-one in that span.
Until now. 
In the last month, the wheels have fallen off that profit vehicle. The Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG), which features stocks that trade at high prices relative to their earnings, has sunk more than 10 percent so far in October, its poorest performance since the financial crisis. In that same period, the Russell 1000 Value Index (RLV) is down just 7 percent.
That shift was cast into sharp relief last week after major revenue shortfalls reported by both Amazon and Alphabet triggered the largest drops in their stock prices in years. Nasdaq (IXIC), stacked with growth names from the tech sector in particular, is in a full-fledged correction - the term for a fall of at least 10 percent from the most recent peak.
Heading into the month, the gap in performance between the Russell's growth and value indexes hit the widest level in at least 40 years. Previous instances of such a widening led to a comeback in value stocks, which include names such as JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), and has fueled rotation speculation.
""When the rotation started to go back the other way, sort of reversion to the mean, value went on to outperform growth for several years. It was a longstanding reversion-to-the-mean kind of a trade,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) is now down about 9 percent from its Sept. 20 high, with some of the year's best-performing and heavily weighted sectors, such as technology (SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD), contributing to the decline. 
Both of those sectors have fallen for three straight weeks and include growth stocks such as Amazon, and Alphabet, leading some market participants to believe a full-blown rotation into value stocks is under way. 
Technology accounts for a weighting of nearly 35 percent in the Russell 1000 growth index, followed by an 18.8 percent weighting in consumer discretionary, according to FTSERussell data. 
Even with the recent downturn, growth stocks remain expensive on a forward price-to-earnings ratio basis, making the argument for value stocks more persuasive given investor concerns that have fueled the sell-off. 
Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York, said there are sound reasons to own value stocks now.
""We are starting to see earnings accelerate faster for value than for growth, and if GDP is going to be north of 3 percent, we should see a pretty good earnings backdrop,"" DeSanctis said. 
Third-quarter gross domestic product reported on Friday came in at a 3.5 percent annualized growth rate. 
Still, questions remain over whether the shift to value will be a full rotation as the bull market enters its late-cycle stages, or merely a temporary defensive play during a selloff, similar to what happened earlier this year when the S&P 500 tumbled into correction territory in February. 
One thing distinguishing the current environment from earlier this year is that the Federal Reserve seems more determined than previously to keep pressing interest rates higher, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, in New York. That has resulted in higher yields on U.S. Treasury securities.
""Investor psychology has shifted to the idea that long-term yields are rising. When that happens it’s an implicit negative for high-multiple stocks, which tend to reside in the growth category,"" Emanuel said.
Along with the Fed's raising rates, investor concerns have included a slowing China and a stronger dollar, which in turn hurts emerging markets and corporate earnings for large multinational companies. 
""The Fed is saying we are moving ahead, steady rate hikes. That in the face of the weak global issues is what has people spooked and what has value outperforming,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell in New York. 
Still, investors may be missing out on gains by moving too heavily into value now, should the pendulum swing back before the cycle starts to end. 
Not all market participants are convinced the end is near for growth stocks.

""If you think value's going to outperform, you're thinking more at the end of the cycle,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. ""As far as consistent meaningful outperformance by value, that's not going to happen until we're halfway through the next recession.""

999,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 12:02AM ET</span>",Death of chairman adds to King Power uncertainty as Thai duty-free changes loom,"By Panu Wongcha-um and Chayut Setboonsarng
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The death of Leicester City soccer club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha adds to challenges his King Power International empire faces as its dominance of the lucrative Thai duty-free industry comes under scrutiny.
Vichai, the founder of King Power, was killed on Saturday along with four others when his helicopter crashed and exploded outside the King Power Stadium in the central England city after a Premier League match.
His death comes just weeks before Thailand plans to hold an auction for its duty-free and commercial concessions, threatening to end King Power's near monopoly of the sector.
State-owned Airports of Thailand Pcl (AOT), which grants the concessions, may consider awarding licenses to multiple operators, analysts said. Unlisted King Power currently controls more than 90 percent of Thailand's duty-free market, being a sole operator with concessions in all major airports in the country until 2020. 
AOT also plans to expand Bangkok's main airport, which will increase commercial and duty free space up for auction by around 70 percent, increasing competition among retailers.
Tourism is booming in Thailand, which received nearly 35 million visitors last year, most funneled through the airports where King Power is ubiquitous. But public debate has increased over the single duty-free operator structure.
""If there is more competition from others and this new generation of leadership (at King Power) is not as effective as Vichai's generation, then there could be changes (in the way the licenses are granted),"" a senior government official told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
""AOT has not been convincing enough in defending this model so it will be a tough sell for them to come up with a bidding terms or process that limits competition.""
AOT, which has said the current system is important to provide continuity, declined to comment on the bidding process.
""(King Power) has a successful history in duty free retailing and the travel industry, now the question is how effective King Power can be in engaging the government other stakeholders without Vichai's leadership, especially in upcoming auction for concessions in Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya and Samut Prakan,"" said Nattabhorn Juengsanguansit, Director at Asia Group Advisors, a government affairs consultancy.
""Winning the upcoming bid is crucial for King Power's business and the future of Leicester football club.”
Retail rivals including Central Group, the Mall Group and South Korea's Hotel Shilla are interested in bidding, analysts said.
The companies declined to comment. 
SUCCESSOR
While it is not immediately clear who will take over from Vichai, analysts and sources say Aiyawatt, Vichai's youngest son and chief executive officer of King Power, and his widow Aimon are most likely to run the family business. Aiyawatt's nickname is Top.
""Top has been his father's apprentice for more than 10 years so he must have learnt a lot of his trade,"" said a politician who has close ties with the Srivaddhanaprabha family.
King Power declined to comment on who will succeed Vichai as group chairman. Vichai's four children and his wife are part of the executive team of the company. 
A descendant of Chinese immigrants, Vichai founded what became the King Power empire in 1989 with a store in Bangkok selling duty free goods and souvenirs.
His business took off in 2006 when it was granted a concession at the new Suvarnabhumi Airport under the government of then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Even after Thaksin's ouster that year, Vichai's close relationship with the royal family and a knack for winning people over helped King Power navigate political turmoil. Vichai became the country's fifth-richest person with an estimated net worth of nearly $5 billion.
For the group, which has been expanding into sports, winning the upcoming duty-free license auction has become more crucial to get steady cash flow and fund heavy investments to acquire athletes and managing staff. 
It bought Leicester City in 2010 and also owns Belgian soccer club Oud-Heverlee Leuven.
While Vichai has been public face of Leicester City, he entrusted the task of running the team to Top, his 32-year-old son.
Top admitted he made some big mistakes while managing the team, but also learned from them.
""If I didn't make those mistakes, I wouldn't be here,"" he told a TEDx Talk show in 2016, referring to his decision to fire three team managers and buy expensive players who did not perform well.
Top said the team's failure to get promoted to the Premier League in 2012/13 season was ""torture"" but three years later, Leicester City beat odds of 5,000/1 to win the Premier League title.
Whether he can hit a similar jackpot with the group's duty-free business remains to be seen.

""I don't know how good Vichai's son is,"" the senior government official said. ""If he is as skilful as his father then there is no problem, but we simply do not know.""

The operation was mainly conducted in the one-year tenor of dollar/yuan swaps, the traders said.
The swap points for such a contract  sunk to as low as -135 points, the lowest level since Sept. 6, down from the previous close of -109 points.
A negative number implies the yuan's anticipated value against the dollar in a year's time was expected to rise.
""Big state banks were pushing down the swap points, forcing others to follow,"" said one of the traders.
Similar operations by major Chinese banks took place during the summer, with traders saying the action was fueled by easing monetary policy.
On Tuesday, traders said there was no immediate evidence that the banks were selling the dollars they acquired via swaps in the spot market. Such a maneuver would support the value of spot yuan  against the dollar.
Two traders said they suspected the state-run banks were stockpiling dollars for future use.
China's biggest state-owned banks are widely believed to often act on behalf of the People's Bank of China in the foreign exchange market.
The yuan is trading at its weakest level in over a decade in the onshore spot market, stirring speculation over whether the central bank will tolerate a slide beyond the closely watched level of 7 per dollar, which could risk a sharp increase in capital outflows from the already cooling economy.

The net loss for the three months to September will be $90 million to $115 million, according to a filing on Monday. It expects to incur restructuring costs of about $35 million, after spending more than $100 million in the first half.
Once Asia’s largest commodity trader, Noble Group’s crisis has escalated in recent years as losses and defaults mounted. Creditors gather on Nov. 8 to vote on its restructuring plan, which has been approved by shareholders.
In addition to restructuring costs, the company highlighted a loss of $55 million from discontinued operations, including from assets disposed of several years ago as troubles intensified. The figure included a provision for agricultural operations sold in 2014 and 2015, as well as against the oil liquids business.
More than 88 percent of creditors have acceded to the restructuring, Noble said on Monday. The deal, which is due to be completed before the end of the year, will wipe out about half of the trader’s debt.
The loss left the company with a negative net asset position of $1.1 billion, it said. Despite “constraints on liquidity and availability of competitive trade finance to support operations,” Noble said implementing the debt plan should “restore shareholders’ equity and create a sustainable capital structure.”
Share Rout
Once worth more than $10 billion, the company now has a market value of about $80 million. On Tuesday, the stock fell as much as 7 percent.
The trader expects third-quarter operating profit before interest, tax and restructuring expenses, but after selling costs, of $20 million to $35 million, aided by the metals business, which includes its Jamalco alumina plant in Jamaica. Prices of alumina have spiked this year on supply concerns.
“The operating profit guided for 3Q is a decline from 2Q,” said Neel Gopalakrishnan, a senior credit strategist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “Although details are not available, the trend is not positive,” he said, adding that investors are likely to focus on the longer-term sustainability of any turnaround after the restructuring.
While Noble continued to execute on contracted flows in the latest period, total volumes -- including offtake and marketing -- were lower than in the first and second quarters as it reduced freight business volumes, the company said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber heads to a British court on Tuesday to defend its business model of treating drivers as self-employed, entitling them to few rights in law, in the latest stage of a long-running battle at the taxi app.
The Silicon Valley-based company, which could be valued at $120 billion in a forthcoming flotation, has faced legal action, protests, regulator crackdowns and license losses around the world as it challenges existing competitors and rapidly expands. 
In 2016, two British drivers successfully argued at a tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and that they should be given workers’ rights, which include receiving the minimum wage.
An employment appeal tribunal upheld that decision last year prompting Uber to go to the Court of Appeal, with a two-day hearing due to begin on Tuesday. 
Unions argue that the gig economy - where people often work for various employers at the same time without fixed contracts - is exploitative, whilst Uber says its drivers enjoy the terms of their work and on average earn much more than the minimum wage. 
""We will do everything that we can to preserve that flexibility and preserve that power for our driver partners because every single one that I've talked to says that they absolutely treasure it,"" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said last week in London. 
In Britain, the self-employed are entitled to only basic protections such as health and safety but workers receive benefits such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks. Uber has introduced a number of benefits for drivers.
Co-claimant in the case and chair of the drivers' branch of The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain James Farrar criticized the taxi app for continuing to oppose the original tribunal decision.
""It's two years since we beat Uber at the Employment Tribunal, yet minicab drivers all over the UK are still waiting for justice, while Uber exhausts endless appeals,"" he said. 
Rights at firms such as Uber, fellow taxi service Addison Lee and food courier Deliveroo have risen up the political agenda in Britain as more people work for companies without fixed hours or a guaranteed income.
A march backed by several trade unions and involving cleaners, receptionists and security officers is due to take place on Tuesday. 
Prime Minister Theresa May launched a review into working practices but her administration has yet to provide a response after a consultation closed over the summer. 

The government will reply in ""due course,"" a business ministry spokeswoman said.

According to the report, no decisions had been made but preparations for a new list of U.S. tariffs were being made in case the Trump-Xi meeting does not yield progress in resolving the U.S.-China disputes. https://bloom.bg/2OUfGHv)
A person familiar with the administration's tariff deliberations told Reuters that there could soon be movement toward a new round of tariffs, adding ""the wheels are turning"" in that direction, with no further elaboration.
The Bloomberg report sent stocks lower on Monday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) ended down 1 percent, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) fell 1.6 percent, also on weakness in technology and internet shares.
Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States, which exceed $257 billion, if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies.
Trump has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. Previous rounds of U.S. tariffs have taken at least two months to impose once a list of products was announced, allowing for public comments to be aired.
Previous rounds of tariffs have focused on Chinese capital and intermediate goods, but a final round would hit consumer products including cell phones, computers, clothing and footwear hard.
Asked about a new tariff announcement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told a briefing: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the president's meeting, and I hope it goes well.""
Another White House spokeswoman said there was ""nothing new at this time"" regarding tariffs on Chinese goods.
Leaders of the world's two largest economies are due to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office referred Reuters to Sanders' statement, while U.S. Commerce Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters earlier this month in Bali, Indonesia that China needed to agree to specific ""action items"" to rebalance the U.S.-Chin economic relationship, opening markets and changing technology transfer, subsidy and currency policies.
U.S.-China Business Council senior vice president Erin Ennis said that it would not be a surprise to see Trump move toward announcing more tariffs, given his repeated threats to do so. But she said the group representing U.S. companies doing business in China was urging both sides to better use the time before the Trump-Xi meeting to figure out how progress can be made on substantive issues.

""Our hope is that cooler heads will prevail and they will start having substantive discussions that will address the Americans' concerns and start lifting the tariffs,"" Ennis said.

According to Commerce, Jinhua “poses a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States.”
“Placing Jinhua on the Entity List will limit its ability to threaten the supply chain for essential components in our military systems,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in the statement.
As a result, a license is required for all exports, re-exports and transfers of commodities, software and technology subject to the Export Administration Regulations. Such license applications will be reviewed with a presumption of denial, Commerce said.
The development is adding pressure to the already fragile relationship between the world’s two largest economies, which have been engaging in an escalating trade war for months. The two have imposed tariffs on about $360 billion worth of two-way trade on each other.
Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the company was one of China’s potential national champions in the semiconductor industry and is in a dispute with its main competitor, U.S.-based chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).
While the decision would mainly help Micron in the short term, the administration is trying to set a precedent for how it treats Chinese state-owned enterprises in the long run, he said."

“The concern about global growth and global trade ... continues to create an overhang for U.S. corporations and global equities,"" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey.
""Growth stocks typically do poorly in situations of global growth decelerating,"" he said. ""You set yourself up for a more defensive market until there’s a clear sign that investors can grab hold of.""
Market volatility has spiked in recent weeks, stemming from higher U.S. interest rates and worries about economic growth peaking and trade tensions. Investors also may be increasingly nervous about uncertainty surrounding U.S. congressional elections, now just a week away.
""Probably the most pervasive headwind is concern about midterm elections,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""That is weighing down stocks, particularly technology as there is greater concern about regulation.""
Internet stocks also may have been wounded by Britain's plan to tax the revenue from online platforms.
In corporate news, shares of software maker Red Hat Inc (N:RHT) surged 45.4 percent after the company agreed to be bought by  IBM  Corp (N:IBM) for $34 billion, but IBM shares fell 4.1 percent, weighing on the Dow and S&P.
Investors who are bullish about stocks point to strong corporate profits this year and economic growth, but there are also concerns about the extent of a slowdown in earnings growth next year, while weak housing data has raised some worries about the consumer.
Data on Monday showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh consecutive month in September, but income recorded its smallest gain in more than a year amid moderate wage growth, suggesting the current pace of spending was unlikely to be sustained.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 65 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 260 new lows. 

About 9.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 8.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 05:16PM ET</span>","China's OnePlus, backed by Qualcomm and T-Mobile, launches smartphone in U.S","By Sijia Jiang and Sheila Dang
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Chinese smartphone company whose high-end products are little known outside a tech-savvy niche entered the U.S. market on Monday with the backing of two key local allies - chipmaking giant Qualcomm (O:QCOM) and mobile operator T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) - and no questions from U.S. regulators.
The foray by 5-year-old Shenzhen-based OnePlus comes after U.S. mobile carriers AT&T (N:T) and Verizon (N:VZ) this year backed away from plans to work with China's Huawei on high-end phones in face of pressure from the U.S. government, which considers Huawei a security risk.
The United States also briefly banned companies from selling goods to ZTE (SZ:000063) , which was caught shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea, violating U.S. sanctions.
""Given the involvement of the Chinese government with other Chinese telecommunications companies, we should always take a close look any time a new Chinese telecommunications supplier tries to enter the domestic market,"" said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, in an emailed response to a Reuters question. ""There can be real security concerns here, as we saw with Huawei and ZTE.""
But the OnePlus alliance, announced at an event on Monday in New York, shows how many U.S.-China business relationships, including those involving the most advanced technologies, are marching ahead despite the escalating U.S. China trade war. 
T-Mobile said the OnePlus 6T smart phone would launch exclusively at the carrier's stores on Nov. 1 with a starting price of $549, the first time a OnePlus handset has been sold through a U.S. wireless provider - and a deal that the firm's larger rivals such as Huawei could not pull off. 
While some OnePlus models have been on sale in the United States through e-commerce websites, carrier relationships like the one with T-Mobile are critical because most U.S. consumers still purchase phones through their carriers.
""I don't know if it is a good time for anybody else,"" Carl Pei, the 29-year-old founder of OnePlus, said of the prospect of entering the U.S. carrier-bundled phone market during an interview with Reuters at an event in Hong Kong last week. ""It is a good time for us.""
In an interview on Monday, Jon Freier, T-mobile's executive vice president of U.S. retail, said the U.S.-China trade battle played no role in this deal and the carrier has not heard from U.S. regulators. ""OnePlus has a sterling reputation, and we've researched the device and vetted it thoroughly,"" Freier said.
Xiaomi, a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature-packed phones at bargain prices, has said it plans to launch in the United States next year but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place. 
OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies, which typically focus on mass-market products for domestic customers. OnePlus, by contrast, only sells premium phones that cost $400 or more and almost exclusively online except in India. It derives two-thirds of its revenue from outside China and is the top seller of premium smartphones in India.
OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO, a Chinese smartphone-maker and a major force in mid-end phones, which are sold globally and cost about $300. The relationship helps OnePlus keep its costs low, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.
According to Chinese company registration records, the two companies have common shareholders.
Pei shrugged off any concerns that U.S. consumer sentiment would be affected by the China-US trade conflict. ""At the end of the day, all you can control is your own [product].""
Pei, who was born in China and raised in Sweden, said the brand is cross-cultural and international: ""When we started, we saw that through social media, you can talk to everyone around the world, as long as you can speak their language.""

""If OnePlus is an independent actor and not under the thumb of the Chinese communist party, we should welcome them to compete in the US market,"" Senator Warner said. ""But we need to make sure they are that independent actor and cannot be leveraged by the Chinese government to hurt our national security.""

1. Coke Leads Earnings Parade
Several big names are reporting their latest results as earnings season continued.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will report numbers before the bell, with the Street looking for a profit of 55 cents per share, up from a profit of 50 cents per share in the year-ago period.
Investors will also be looking to see if there is any update on possible plans for the company to enter the cannabis beverage market.
Also reporting are  General Electric  (NYSE:GE),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Under Armour (NYSE:UA).
2. Consumer Confidence Expected to Dip
The highlight of the economic calendar tomorrow will be the latest reading on the health of the consumer.
The Conference Board will release its consumer confidence index at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the index fell to 136 in October from 138.4 in the previous month.
Confidence has been steadily increasing and is now around levels not seen since 2000.
3. Oil in Focus as Energy Stocks Struggle
Oil prices will be closely watched as crude’s decline is hampering energy stocks.
With the deadline to the Nov. 4 Iran sanctions in its final stretch, there is no credible information on the volumes of crude Iran is still shipping to the world, according to multiple sources trying to track outbound oil cargoes from the Islamic republic.
“The problem in the oil market right now is the speed with which information and even expected developments are getting priced in, as the explosion in machine-driving trading has led to more extreme swings within days, if not hours, compared to the past, when trends were allowed to develop over months, ” London-based Energy Aspects said in a note.
Prices could be pushed lower tomorrow if APR reports another strong rise in crude inventories."

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Australia's AMP says banking arm to cut fees,"(Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd said on Monday its banking arm would reduce or remove 20 fees to simplify its product offering to customers, after saying last week it was losing clients at its flagship wealth management division.
The troubled wealth manager, which has admitted at a government-backed inquiry to having charged customers for advice they never received and misleading regulators, said it would remove nine special service fees and reduce a further 11 across its deposit and lending products, effective Nov. 30.
In a statement on its website, AMP added that the fees being reduced were one-off transaction fees and that the bank planned to further simplify fees next year, including mortgage fees.
Customers in legacy transaction accounts will be moved to up-to-date products, it said.
The announcement comes after the 170-year-old company said last week it would sell its life insurance arm at a discount and revealed that its funds were rapidly losing cash as clients pulled out their money in response to revelations of systematic wrongdoing.
Withdrawals soared to about A$1.5 billion in the third quarter, from A$243 million in the second. The division had total assets under management of A$132.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
Shares fell 25 percent in response to the news last Thursday, to a record low. The stock has halved since the inquiry into the Australian finance sector began in February.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 04:08PM ET</span>",GM says it favors fuel-efficiency rules based on historic rates,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) backs an annual increase in fuel-efficiency standards based on ""historic rates"" rather than tough Obama era rules or a Trump administration proposal that would freeze requirements, according to a federal filing made public on Monday.
The largest U.S. automaker said the Obama rules that aimed to hike fleetwide fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 are ""not technologically feasible or economically practicable.
The Detroit automaker said that since 1980, the motor vehicle fleet has improved fuel efficiency at an average rate of 1 percent a year.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said in separate comments that the auto industry is complying with existing fuel efficiency requirements by using credits from prior model years.
As a result even if requirements are frozen at 2020 levels ""the industry would need to continue to improve fuel economy"" as credits expire, it added, warning if the government hikes standards beyond 2020 requirements ""the situation worsens ... without some significant form of offset or flexibility.""
Fiat Chrysler and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) urged the government to reclassify two-wheel drive SUVs as light trucks, which face less stringent requirements than cars. A four-wheel drive version of the same SUV is considered a light truck.
Ford's comments back fuel rules ""that increase year-over-year with additional flexibility to help us provide more affordable options for our customers.""
GM's comments said it was ""troubled"" that President Donald Trump's administration wants to phase out incentives for electric vehicles.
The Trump plan’s preferred alternative freezes standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s but reduce automakers' collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules.
The administration of former President Barack Obama had adopted rules, effective in 2021, calling for an annual increase of 4.4 percent in fuel-efficiency requirements from 2022 through 2025.
GM has been lobbying Congress to lift the existing cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The credit phases out over a 12-month period after an individual automaker hits 200,000 electric vehicles sold.
GM said the current tax credit puts ""companies like GM and Tesla (O:TSLA) at severe pricing disadvantage in the market for several years."" On Friday, GM called for a nationwide zero-emission vehicle program, while 20 U.S. states called for the administration to abandon its proposal to weaken the Obama rules. 
The GM proposal also calls for a U.S. national building code to require new residential construction to support EV charging and dramatically increase government spending on research and development in battery cell technologies.

The Trump administration said it will review all comments before issuing final regulations by the end of March.

1066,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Sinks as Trade Tensions Rattle Investors,"Investing.com – The Dow reversed intraday gains to close sharply lower Monday on fears of a further escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.99%. The S&P 500 fell 0.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.63%.
The blue-chip index was down more than 500 points before a last-minute rise pared some losses, with the Dow ending down less than 300 points.
Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. is planning on implementing additional tariffs on more Chinese products if upcoming talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are unsuccessful.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of US imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
The report rattled risk sentiment, prompting investors to abandon their bullish intraday bets, with trade-sensitive names and technology leading the decline on Wall Street.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 6% and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) nearly 1%, two bellwethers for global trade. Boeing was also pressured by news that a Boeing 737 airliner crashed into the sea with 189 people on board in Indonesia.
A plunge in tech stocks, meanwhile, also exacerbated the selloff on Wall Street, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The S&P 500 Information Technology index closed down about 2%.
Energy, meanwhile, retreated further into correction territory, as oil prices fell on concerns about waning global demand and a continued increase in output from Saudi Arabia and Russia ahead of sanctions on Iran, slated for Nov. 4.
Financials, however, offered a semblance of refuge, rising nearly 1% as banking stocks edged higher supported by an uptick in U.S. government bond yields.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose 1%, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rose nearly 2%.
The weaker start to the week on Wall Street comes despite calls from analysts claiming the broader averages were set for a rebound as the recent selloff was overdone.
""The recent sell-off has priced too sharp of a near-term growth slowdown,"" David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a note to clients. ""We expect continued economic and earnings growth will support a rebound in the S&P 500.""
In corporate news,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) closed 4% lower after announcing Sunday it would acquire software maker Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) in a deal worth about $34 billion, or $190 a share, 63% above Red Hat's closing price Friday, raising concerns about margin pressures. IBM said it would continue to grow its dividend, but will suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.
IBM's M&A activity, which by design is supposed to augment its IT Services segment with digital-related skills ""will likely continue to have a detrimental impact on margins and free cash flows,"" Wedbush said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states are preparing to counter money-laundering by giving bank supervisors clearer powers and reviewing recent high-profile cases, a draft plan seen by Reuters showed.
The plan is a response to alleged money-laundering scandals involving banks in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain and Cyprus, with schemes often executed through foreign branches inside the EU.
The paper, dated Oct. 29, which is subject to changes until its adoption in early December, mandates the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission to conduct a review of alleged money-laundering cases by mid-2019 with the view of ""possible additional actions"" to strengthen the EU legal framework.
The document outlining the plan lists a number of short-term measures to be taken by the end of next year to improve the EU's ability to prevent and counter financial crime.
EU supervisors would have clearer powers to assess whether bank managers are fit for their job and to withdraw banking licences for serious breaches of anti money-laundering rules.

The plan invites the European Commission to propose by September 2019 other long-term measures to strengthen EU rules, but does not explicitly mention forming a common agency to supervise financial crime, as demanded by the ECB.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) will have to equal a record final quarter for deliveries if the European planemaker is going to meet its overall 2018 targets following a series of production setbacks.
Flight Ascend, a UK-based consultancy which monitors fleet developments worldwide, told aircraft investors in Hong Kong that Airbus may struggle to meet its target for 800 total aircraft deliveries this year.
And Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said in a note that Airbus faced a shortfall in deliveries of its best-selling A320neo due to ongoing engine delays and operational problems.
The warnings came as Airbus prepares to post third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, when all eyes will be on whether it keeps its full-year target of 800 jet deliveries.
By end-September, Airbus was already facing a tough - though not unprecedented - challenge in meeting its full-year goal, a Reuters analysis of delivery data shows.
To meet the goal it would have to repeat exactly the record pattern of 2017, when 37 percent of the total number of annual deliveries were squeezed into the final quarter.
Airbus ""usually pulls a rabbit out of the hat, so I wouldn't bet against it,"" a financial source familiar with the process said, adding delays had stressed the global aircraft industry.
For the first nine months, Airbus delivered 503 aircraft, leaving it once again with 37 percent of the targeted annual figure to accomplish in just three months. 
The average achieved over that quarterly period in the past 10 years was 31 percent, according to a Reuters review of Airbus data.
Crucial to whether Airbus meets its goal is progress on best-selling single-aisle jets like the A320 and A321.
Commercial jets make up 76 percent of Airbus revenues, which are mostly paid on delivery, while aircraft lessors, who control around half the global fleet, lose $10,000 a day for a late A320-family jet, experts said.
Airbus does not publish separate delivery targets for single-aisle jets but Flight Ascend estimates this year's target at around 630, leaving 76 a month to go in the last quarter.
""October numbers are sitting in the mid-50s which means it ... is very challenging to reach the target for the end of year,"" Ascend's Ryan Hammacott told a Hong Kong seminar.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported Airbus faced new problems in producing the A321neo, a model central to its ambition to dominate the top end of the single-aisle market and thwart Boeing's (N:BA) plans for a new mid-sized passenger jet. 
Last week Rolls-Royce (L:RR) disclosed a shortfall in engine deliveries for the big A330neo.
Airbus planemaking president Guillame Faury last week confirmed Airbus was facing internal problems with the A321neo, but declined to discuss any impact on the delivery target.
Faury, who is the designated future Airbus chief executive has made stabilizing deliveries a top priority.
Harned said stock markets may absorb a downgrade in the delivery target but would watch for any signs of stress in 2019.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Danske Bank clears whistleblower to speak freely in European Parliament,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A whistleblower who helped to reveal a major money laundering scandal at  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) has been freed of confidentiality obligations to the company ahead of his testimony in the European Parliament next month.
The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which Denmark's largest bank said in a report last month it regards as suspicious.
Howard Wilkinson, a British trader in Danske Bank's Estonia branch until 2014, is scheduled to testify at public hearings in Copenhagen on Nov. 19, and in Brussels on Nov. 21.
""We have released the person in question of all contractual duties of confidentiality in relation to Danske Bank,"" a Danske spokesman said in a statement.
""We have previously sent a legal statement to the (whistleblower) giving our permission to talk to the relevant supervisory authorities in Denmark and Estonia, and have encouraged the person in question to,"" the spokesman said.
Wilkinson's U.S.-based lawyer Stephen Kohn confirmed in an emailed statement that his client had been granted permission to testify and encouraged Danske Bank to give a waiver to all employees who had signed similar agreements.
""Had the Bank not insisted upon an overly broad secrecy agreement, the harm caused by the illegal money laundering scheme would have been significantly mitigated,"" Kohn said.
""The bank must also permit full disclosure to all law enforcement entities in Estonia and Denmark,"" he added.
It is crucial that Wilkinson be freed of any non-disclosure agreements following so that he can speak freely, Jeppe Kofod, a spokesman for the European Parliament committee that is arranging the Brussels hearing, told Reuters last week.
The scandal has led the bank's former chief executive Thomas Borgen to resign and almost halved Danske Bank share price since February.

The bank's interim CEO, Jesper Nielsen, will represent the bank in the hearings in the Danish and European Parliament, the Danske statement said.

(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. automakers rose on Monday after a report that China was considering halving its car purchase tax to 5 percent to support its struggling auto industry, which has been hit hard by the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war.
Shares of General Motors Co (N:GM), the No.1 U.S. automaker by sales, rose as much as 5 percent to $34.30, while those of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) jumped about 7 percent. Shares of the two companies have fallen more than 20 percent this year.
""From a China perspective, the extension of a purchase benefit (could) help to alleviate some of the trade dispute overhang, and is likely contributing to stocks performance today,"" Consumer Edge Research analyst James Albertine said.
China's National Development and Reform Commission, the top regulator, has submitted a plan but no decision has been made, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/2RgGRZy)
The measure would apply to cars with engines no bigger than 1.6 liters, according to the report. 
Reuters had previously reported that the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) had submitted documents to the country's finance and commerce ministries, proposing the auto purchase tax be halved.
The European auto stocks index (SXAP) also rose after the report and was set for its best day in nearly 4 months.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 11:29AM ET</span>",Pot firm Curaleaf shares fall on debut after record equity raise,"By Nichola Saminather and John Tilak
TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. cannabis retailer Curaleaf Holdings Inc (CD:CURA) opened lower in its trading debut in Toronto on Monday after amassing $400 million in the biggest equity raising in Canada's marijuana industry.
Curaleaf opened at C$8.70 on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), lower than the offer price of C$11.45. 
It recovered to trade 18.4 percent higher at 10:26 a.m. ET but remained below the issue price at C$10.30. That compared with a 3.8 percent fall in the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (TO:HMMJ). 
Curaleaf's raising was almost triple its intended $150 million offering, giving it a market value of about $4 billion in the biggest-ever reverse takeover on the CSE. 
Reverse takeovers allow companies to go public by rolling into listed shell corporations. 
The lower trading price ""is not unusual when a company increases the size of the raise,"" said Russell Stanley, managing director for equity research at Beacon Securities. ""We've also seen a rough couple of weeks for the cannabis space as a whole.""
The marijuana industry saw a flurry of capital raisings and acquisitions, as well as strong share price rallies before Canada's legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct. 17. 
Since then, cannabis shares have retreated on profit-taking and concerns about valuations.
Even so, Curaleaf's raising attracted more than 100 institutional investors, according to the company. 
Those institutions, from the United States, Canada and Europe, accounted for 90 percent of demand, Boris Jordan, executive chairman of the Wakefield, Massachusetts-based company, told Reuters. 
""We were quite surprised by the demand,"" Jordan said. ""Being one of the larger players in the U.S., there was a lot of attraction in investing in a company that has a multi-state footprint.""
Curaleaf owns 28 dispensaries, 12 cultivation and 9 processing sites in 12 U.S. states.
It plans to grow to 41 stores by year end, and to over 69 by the end of 2020, with cultivation also expanding, Jordan said. 
With the company focused on the United States, it will likely open stores in Ohio and Illinois next, Jordan said. 
The United States is the world's largest cannabis market, accounting for almost 90 percent of the $9.5 billion in global sales in 2017, despite a federal ban, according to research firms Arcview Group and BDS Analytics. 

""If we can build the biggest company in the U.S. we’ll have the wherewithal, when we get to maximum penetration here, (to) start looking at other markets,"" Jordan said.

""We think it will be difficult for prosecutors to prove criminal wrongdoing,"" Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, said in a note to clients as reported by Bloomberg. Kallo, who has a bullish $411 price target for the stock, added that ""investigators would need to find evidence TSLA made projections it knew would be impossible to achieve, which we believe is a high bar to meet.""
Kallo also added that the article ""largely recycled previously reported information,"" and that it finds ""certainaspects of the article suspect."" 
He wasn't the only Tesla bull skeptical of the Paper's reporting, which said late Friday that an FBI investigation is focused on Model 3 communications by Tesla as far back as early 2017, citing people ""familiar with the matter."" The company said it had received ""no additional document requests"" from the Department of Justice for ""months,"" while supporters nearly immediately sought to connect the article with short sellers, or those investors betting against Tesla's stock price.
""Good question,” CEO Elon Musk added on twitter in response to a question asking ""where is the SEC when the WSJ published old information purely meant to distort the stock and harm investors?""
Another vocal Tesla supporter, Ross Gerber of the Los Angeles firm Gerber Kawasaki, called the article questionable.
""You’ve got to wonder how much the media is being manipulated by Tesla shorts,""  he tweeted. ""Of course as the stock breaks out they release some BS WSJ article. Mid day. Not questionable at all.""
Shares of Tesla fell slightly following the Wall Street Journal's report Friday, but still managed to close in the green. The stock opened up more than 2% Monday morning following the bullish note from Baird.
Musk, who  recently informed Tesla of his plans to purchase $20 million of the company's stock in the next available window, seemed to hint that the purchase could be made Monday in a tweet. Shortly after, he said he would be ""signing off Twitter for a few days."""
1130,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>",Banks could reap as much as $115 million for orchestrating the IBM-Red Hat deal — the largest software acquisition in history,"IBM unleashed the largest software deal in history over the weekend, and if  its $34 billion buyout of Red Hat closes, the bankers who helped orchestrate the acquisition could reap as much as $115 million in fees. 
On Sunday IBM announced it was paying $190 a share for Red Hat — best known for selling open-source Linux software for enterprise computing infrastructure, app development, and cloud management — a 60% premium from the company's closing stock price on Friday, which has been battered amid the ongoing market turmoil. 
Guggenheim and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Red Hat's advisers, are set to split an estimated $50 million to $70 million in fees for working on the deal, according to Jeffrey Nassof, the director of the consulting firm Freeman & Co.
IBM's advisers — JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Lazard — are expected to split an estimated $35 million to $45 million, Nassof said. 
That doesn't include fees for financing. Depending on how IBM pays for the deal, banks that underwrite the debt would be in line for another hefty payday. 
In a year that has already been hot for tech mergers and acquisitions, this tie-up tops the chart.
Through the first three quarters of the year, banks pulled in about $3 billion in revenue from tech M&A globally, far outpacing any other sector, according to data from Dealogic. Healthcare was a distant second at less than $2 billion.
The IBM-Red Hat deal, which is the largest tech buyout since Dell paid $67 billion for data-storage giant EMC back in 2015 and the largest software deal ever, could boost that tally even further if the deal closes. "

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>","Norway wealth fund's China investments bound to grow, says CEO","By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $970-billion sovereign wealth fund will inevitably step up its investments in China in tandem with other major global funds, but that process could take a decade rather than a couple of years, its CEO said.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund owns stock in over 9,000 companies and about 1.4 percent of globally listed shares, giving it a broad investment base whose performance closely tracks that of the world economy.
But it is under-represented in China, where Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters in an interview that it had ""extraordinarily small"" investments of around $25 billion.
""I think gradually the large index providers and large institutional funds will include China, Asia, into their main indices and large institutions like ourselves are likely to increase our investments as a consequence of that,"" he said. 
""It will be a process over a decade, not one to two years. But certainly investments in China will increase over time."" 
GRAPHIC: Largest sovereign wealth funds - http://tmsnrt.rs/2tskfub 
U.S. investments, by contrast, account for nearly half the fund's portfolio, said Slyngstad.
It is a major investor in the U.S. tech sector, where he expects regulation to be imposed on firms with information management at the core of their businesses.
Firms including Facebook (O:FB), Google (O:GOOGL), Twitter (N:TWTR) have been a source of concerns for regulators in Europe and in the United States over their handling of user data.
""I don't think it is a question of whether you will get regulation, it is just which format it will take,"" he said.
""...Information is of course a sensitive topic in a democracy. Who sits on it? Who owns it? Who is allowed to use it and in which ways?""
Asked whether the fund had addressed these issues directly with companies it is invested in, Slyngstad said, citing Facebook, that it had mainly done it through voting at annual general meetings.
This year it backed shareholder proposals opposed by management requiring Facebook to make a report on major 'fake news' controversies. The fund is the ninth-largest Facebook investor with a 0.91 percent stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
On global trade, Slyngstad has previously expressed concerns about what trade wars could do to international supply chains, raising the question of whether they might give rise to a U.S.-centered one and a Chinese-centered one. 

""You may get two different internet regions: the Chinese internet with giants Ali Baba (N:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700) ... They have more cross-service functionality than the U.S. ones.""

1135,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Says Sell Rallies as Goldman Sees Chance to Buy,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock sell-off this month has been ugly, despite the rally Monday. Whether it’s been hideous enough to signal a turnaround is a topic of debate among two of the biggest U.S. banks.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is of the opinion that there’s further downside left.
“The rolling bear market continues to make progress and there is growing evidence that it is morphing into a proper cyclical bear market,” strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note Monday, affirming a theme he’s been discussing for several months. “Rallies should be sold until the liquidity picture improves, valuations compress further or 2019 earnings estimates are reduced.”
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., on the other hand, thinks the rout has gone too far.
“The sell-off appears to have overshot the fundamentals,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. “We expect continued positive economic data and prospective EPS growth (+7% in 2019) to support an S&P 500 rebound to our year-end target of 2,850. The resumption of discretionary buybacks should also provide a tailwind.”
This divergence of opinion comes after a persistent downtrend that’s lopped more than 9 percent off the S&P 500 since its record high Sept. 20 amid concerns global growth is slowing and U.S. corporate earnings are vulnerable. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). pointed out on Friday that only about 20 percent of assets have generated positive returns on the year, a lower amount than any time other than the 2008 financial crisis and 1970s stagflation.
The stock market is selling off in ways that differ from other recent declines and it bodes badly for future performance, Wilson said. For instance, the losses were concentrated in sectors where portfolio managers are most exposed such as technology and consumer discretionary, meaning there’s “extreme portfolio pain.” Nearly half of stocks in the MSCI U.S. Equity Index have fallen at least 20 percent from their 52-week high, he added, saying momentum suggests that number is likely to increase if things don’t stabilize soon.
Wilson also pointed to the S&P 500’s break below its 200-day moving average, showing the collapse in market breadth “is more fundamentally driven than most market participants and commentators have acknowledged.” He said a pullback in earnings is looking more likely, and that would fit with his bear-case 2018 S&P 500 target of 2,400. He noted, however, that he sees the S&P 500 as in a secular bull market, with this year representing a cyclical bear within that.
Goldman’s Kostin isn’t saying everything’s rosy -- for instance, he expects U.S. gross domestic product growth to decelerate and says that earnings estimates are too optimistic. But amid the backdrop, he recommends buying “quality stocks” as the cycle matures.
JPMorgan strategists led by John Normand said investors are nervous about liquidity constraints in what they see as the late stages of a bull cycle.
“If complacency is one of the words most associated with the pre-Lehman years,” then “paranoia may be the one most tied to what remains of this cycle,” the strategists wrote.
But if Morgan Stanley is right, there could still be 10 percent downside from Friday’s close of 2,658.69.
“Our 2,400 bear case target should hold throughout this correction,” Wilson said. “We think this cyclical bear is taking the course of a consolidation that will keep the S&P 500 in a wide range of 2,400-3,000 for up to two years.”

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>","Red Hat jumps, IBM shares dip on cloud mega-merger","By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp's $34 billion deal to buy Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT) drove shares in the small but fast-growing software maker about 50 percent higher on Monday, reflecting the huge premium IBM is paying to ward off any potential challenger bids.
At $172, shares of Red Hat were still trading around $18 short of the $190 price agreed by the two companies in Sunday's announcement, and analysts said that pointed to some remaining nerves among investors over the chances of the deal closing. 
The breakup fee for the deal, which would be among the largest on record in the tech sector, has yet to be announced and a high fee would also deter Red Hat from entertaining other buyers. 
IBM's stock was down 2 percent on news of the deal, a hint that investors were concerned that, at 10 times 2019 projected sales, it had overpaid for the deal. 
The company's Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty told CNBC in an interview aired early on Monday that she felt the deal was done at the right price. 
""This is a very fair price...(Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst) has built a great company, and unlike others, high growth, high profit and cash and so this is why I think really those are important things for our investors,"" Rometty said.
One brokerage, Stifel, raised the prospect of a competing offer from one of the other major players in cloud computing for whom the deal represents the emergence of a more substantial rival.
""Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (and potentially Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)) have the strategic motivations and financial resources to consummate such a transaction and would not be surprised if we were to see one of them make a competing bid,"" analysts from Stifel said in a note.
HYBRID CLOUD
Rometty told Reuters on Sunday that the increasing use of cloud services from multiple providers was the driving force behind the deal along with the rise of the so-called hybrid cloud, in which companies run some of their software in their own data centers and other elements of it in data centers run by IBM, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, among others. 
Red Hat has been investing heavily in tech tools such as so-called ""containers,"" which make it easier for businesses to split up their computing work among a mix of data centers.
""They want choice and we are going to give it to them,"" Rometty said. ""Multi-cloud is a fact of life.""
In buying Red Hat, IBM will have assembled a cloud that includes physical servers, its own operating system and applications like human resources software. 
But the combined entity will also sell software that runs on its customers own hardware and other clouds. That will put it in direct competition with firms like Microsoft, which has a similar mix of software and cloud services.
""We are going to both compete and partner with those other clouds,"" Rometty said. ""The thing about IBM is, we've been around long enough to know this is a multi-cloud world.""
Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, said the use of multiple clouds has been an advantage for Red Hat.
Cloud providers such as Amazon often offer a house-made version of the Linux operating system for free or at little cost. But that version of Linux is available only on Amazon, and if the business wants to run software on another cloud they would have to ensure it works with a different version of Linux there.
Red Hat offers a standard version of Linux that runs on commonly available clouds as well as a business's own data centers, and Whitehurst said Red Hat customers were increasingly running its operating system on public clouds.
""We are growing faster on the public clouds than the public clouds are growing,"" Whitehurst said in an interview. ""Yeah, you pay us a little extra versus a free cloud offering, but you get the benefit of a standard operating environment.""
Analysts had raised concerns that the purchase may alienate customers worrying that IBM will infringe on the neutrality of Red Hat, which is dubbed as ""Switzerland of the IT stack.""
IBM reiterated on a conference call on Monday that Red Hat would continue to be led by Whitehurst and Red Hat's current management team. It also intends to maintain Red Hat's headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.

The net loss for the three months through September will be about $90 million to $115 million, Noble Group said in a filing to the Singapore Exchange on Monday. It expects to incur restructuring costs of about $35 million for the quarter, after spending more than $100 million in the first half of the year.
Once Asia’s largest commodity trader, Noble Group’s crisis has escalated in recent years as losses and defaults mounted. Creditors gather on Nov. 8 to vote on its restructuring plan, which has already been approved by shareholders.
More than 88 percent of creditors have acceded to the restructuring, Noble said on Monday. The deal, which is due to be completed before the end of the year, will wipe out about half of Noble Group’s debt and hand creditors a controlling stake in the equity.
The quarterly loss left the company with a negative net asset position of about $1.1 billion as of Sept. 30, it said. Despite “ongoing constraints on liquidity and availability of competitive trade finance to support operations,” Noble Group said the implementation of the debt plan should “restore shareholders’ equity and create a sustainable capital structure.”
Once worth more than $10 billion, the company is now valued at about $83 million on the Singapore Exchange.
The trader expects to report third-quarter operating income at $40 million to $55 million, driven by the company’s metals business, which includes its Jamalco alumina plant in Jamaica. Prices of alumina have spiked this year on major supply concerns.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Hitachi agrees to buy Elliott's stake in Italy's Ansaldo STS, ending feud","MILAN (Reuters) - Hitachi (T:6501) has wrapped up a bitter feud with U.S. activist investor Elliott over  Ansaldo STS  (MI:STS), agreeing to buy the fund's stake in the Italian rail signaling group as part of a move to take full control.
The Japanese conglomerate could spend as much as 1.25 billion euros to become the sole owner of Ansaldo STS, which it said would have a leading role to play in growing its rail business, including through acquisitions. 
Hitachi and investment funds led by Elliott have been rowing since the Japanese company took a majority stake in Ansaldo STS in 2015, with Elliott - which holds a minority stake - complaining about the price paid by Hitachi as well as Ansaldo's strategy and governance.
Under the deal announced on Monday, Hitachi will pay a premium of 9.5 percent to buy Elliott's 31.79 percent stake in Ansaldo STS, costing it around 807.6 million euros ($920 million). 
It will then launch a bid for the rest of Italian company with the aim of delisting it.
Hitachi will buy Elliott's shares in Ansaldo STS at 12.70 euros. The mandatory bid on residual shares will then be launched at the same price.
Ansaldo STS shares rose more than 9 percent to a session high of 12.68 euros, matching the offer price.
Owned by U.S. hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Elliott is an outspoken investor in many European and U.S. companies. 
In 2015 Elliott refused to sell its Ansaldo STS shares to Hitachi in a previous public offer on the Italian company, judging the 9.50 euro per share price offered then too low.
The railway industry was shaken last year when  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) announced a plan to merge their rail units into a Franco-German champion to stave off competition from bigger Chinese rival China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation and Canada's Bombardier Transportation.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>",U.S. October auto sales seen down slightly: consultants,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales likely fell slightly in October from a year earlier, when replacement demand following hurricanes Harvey and Irma boosted business, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.
""The year-over-year comparison is difficult as sales in October last year were inflated by vehicle replacement demand associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma,"" Thomas King, senior vice president of J.D. Power's data and analytics division, said in a statement. 
October U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.349 million units, down marginally from 1.351 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 17 selling days of October. Automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), will release October U.S. sales results on Nov. 1.
Earlier this year, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) switched to reporting sales quarterly instead of monthly.
The consultancies said that in October consumers continued to shift away from passenger cars to pickup trucks and SUVs, which accounted for more than 70 percent of retail sales in the first 17 selling days of October. 
This was the first time pickup trucks and SUVs had crossed the 70 percent threshold, the consultancies said. As recently as 2012, passenger cars accounted for more than half of sales.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales for October will be 17.4 million units, down from 17.9 million units in October 2017, the consultancies said.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to around 17.2 million units after hitting a record high in 2016.
Sales had originally been expected to drop further in 2018 because of rising interest rates and the return of more late-model used cars to dealer lots to compete with new ones. 
With a strong U.S. economy and low unemployment, however, sales thus far have exceeded expectations.
LMC stuck with its existing forecast for full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales of 17.2 million units.
Average new vehicle prices remained high, reaching a monthly record in October. 
Jeff Schuster, LMC's president of operations for the Americas, said in a statement that high prices along with further interest rate hikes could cause problems for the auto industry.
""This is a combination that could cause consumers to be squeezed out of the new vehicle market, putting pressure on volume even if other fundamentals are favorable,"" he said.

1151,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Brazil Assets Jump After Bolsonaro Renews Pledge to Fix Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Jair Bolsonaro said the words investors wanted to hear.
Brazil’s next president pledged to trim the deficit, pay down debt and reduce the size of government after results showed him cruising to victory over Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers’ Party. An American depository receipt of Petroleo Brasileiro SA trading in pre-market hours jumped 8 percent, while the biggest overseas exchange-traded fund, the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, added 5.6 percent. Sovereign bonds trading on European exchanges gained.
Brazilian assets are the world’s best performers since polls in mid-September showed the conservative lawmaker and former army captain ascending in polls. The comments from Bolsonaro should tamp down on any skepticism that he wasn’t fully committed to pension and tax overhauls -- which lingered since the candidate himself often professed an ignorance when it came to economics -- pleasing investors who had abandoned Latin America’s largest economy over the past several years as fiscal accounts deteriorated.
“Bolsonaro landed a landslide victory promising Brazil a better future after years of economic downturn and corruption scandals,” said Bernd Berg, a macro and foreign-exchange strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zug, Switzerland. “I am confident Bolsonaro is going to deliver much needed reforms.”
He sees the Ibovespa stock index soaring more than 50 percent to 130,000 by the middle of next year, and predicts the real will climb 21 percent in the same span to 3 per dollar.
He’s not alone in the optimism. UBS Group AG, after months of skepticism on Brazil’s stocks, is now telling investors that under the right circumstances the Ibovespa could rally almost 40 percent over just the next two months. Banco Bradesco SA and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). have both predicted surges, and investors from  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc to NCH Capital are adding to their Brazilian holdings.
The Ibovespa has surged 29 percent in dollar terms over the past six weeks, with the real jumping 15 percent, both posting the best performances globally.
“We will break the vicious cycle of growing debt,” Bolsonaro said in his victory speech. “Substitute it with the virtuous cycle of smaller deficits, falling debt and lower interest rates.”
Part of investors’ giddiness is simply that the Workers’ Party, known as the PT for its initials in Portuguese, won’t be returning to power. Much of the business community blames Brazil’s leftest politicians for corruption and years of economic mismanagement, culminating in the country’s worse recession in a century and the loss of its investment-grade credit rating.
“All of us feel an immense amount of relief that we don’t have to deal with the PT for the next four years, so it’s natural that markets will continue to buy Brazilian assets,” said James Gulbrandsen, the chief investment officer at NCH Capital in Rio de Janeiro, which has $3 billion of assets under management. “We are now focused on the progress of reforms.”
The top priority for most investors is an overhaul of the pension system, which is broadly seen as too expensive to sustain. Changes such as setting a minimum retirement age could go a long way to shoring up fiscal accounts, though they’re likely to meet some resistance among Brazilians who don’t want to give up benefits they believe they’re entitled to.
“It was an expressive win,” said Christopher Garman, the director for the Americas as the political consulting organization Eurasia Group. “But Bolsonaro will have a big challenge ahead. His honeymoon won’t last long, and he’ll have to push through difficult reforms.”
Bolsonaro got 55 percent of the vote to Haddad’s 45 percent with almost all votes counted.

Bolsonaro focused much of his campaign on a tough-on-crime pledge that some observers saw as having racial overtones, and his disparaging comments about women and homosexuals have contributed to a high rejection rate among Brazilians -- about 45 percent. Adding to his potential difficulties when he takes office Jan. 1 in a fractious congress with more than a dozen political parties also seeking to prioritize their pet projects.
In his victory speech, Bolsonaro pledged to heal divisions and govern for all Brazilians.
“We are all a single nation, a democratic nation,” he said. “I will guide a government that defends and protects the rights of the citizens that fulfills its duties and respects its citizens.”
For now, investors are giving him the benefit of the doubt and cheering on his pledges to fortify the economy.
“The local scenario should be extremely positive for earnings growth and for the Brazilian equity market generally,” Frederico Sampaio, the chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity Brazil, wrote in a note. “There should be a more positive climate where consumer and business confidence can pick up again.”

Shares of American and European automakers including General Motors (N:GM), BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) extended gains following the report.
Reuters reported https://reut.rs/2RmNyto earlier this month that the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) has submitted documents to the country's finance and commerce ministries proposing the 10 percent auto purchase tax be halved. 
CADA has made proposals in previous years that have helped shape auto policy. 
China's car sales fell by 11.6 percent to 2.39 million units last month, the most in nearly seven years, stoking concerns that the world's biggest auto market could contract for the first time in decades this year. 

When China last cut the purchase tax three years ago, car sales soared in the world's biggest auto market that is a key battleground for global car makers from GM to Toyota Motor (T:7203).

Dieter Zetsche told the daily Rzeczpospolita that after selling the Tesla shares he ""never regretted it. This does not exclude a cooperation in a future.""
Daimler says Zetsche's remarks were made in response to a hypothetical question during a roundtable discussion at the Paris Motor Show and that there was no plan currently to explore opportunities to cooperate with Tesla.
The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars sold its 4 percent stake in Tesla in 2014. Last month it unveiled its electric SUV to compete with Tesla, which has dominated the fast-growing market for premium battery cars.

Zetsche, who is set to leave his post in May, said he saw no reason to buy Tesla shares again.

The acquisition of eharmony, which was founded in 2000 in Los Angeles and expects to register 2.8 million new users this year, complements ProSieben's own Parship dating franchise which is the market leader in Germany.
""We are bringing together two strong brands and will build them into one of the world's leading online dating businesses,"" ProSieben CEO Max Conze said in a statement.
Terms were not disclosed for the deal to buy eharmony, which was founded by clinical psychologist Neil Clark Warren and uses an extensive online questionnaire to determine the compatibility of potential couples seeking long-term relationships.
Parship and sister brand ElitePartner, which count 2 million registrations a year, use an algorithm that was developed separately in Germany but that is based on a similar approach, said Claas van Delden, co-CEO of Nucom.
""They are based on the same conviction,"" van Delden said. ""In addition the takeover is so attractive because eharmony has a brand awareness of nearly 90 percent and a very big user base that we can serve better from a common platform.""
The transaction follows through on ProSieben's push to diversify away from its core commercial TV franchise, where ad revenues are flat and the sector is being disrupted by streaming platforms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The Munich-based broadcaster bought eharmony via its newly created Nucom division, in which investor General Atlantic took a 24.9 percent stake in February. Nucom in turn owns 94 percent of Parship.
It said the deal would open access not only to the online dating markets in the United States, but also in Canada and Australia where eharmony is also present. The U.S. market is the most richly valued on a per-user basis and is worth $3 billion, ProSieben said, citing independent research.
Privately held eharmony has raised a total of $113 million in two funding rounds, the most recent being in 2004, when it was backed by Tuputele Ventures, TCV, Sequoia Capital and Fayez Sarofim & Co, according to Crunchbase.

Eharmony CEO Grant Langston will continue to run the business while representatives of Parship will join its board.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>","After years of global success, India's Reliance Industries faces oil shock at home","By Koustav Samanta and Promit Mukherjee
SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), currently India's second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market.
Reliance's refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
That began to change when India's oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world's third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country's retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations.
This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after India's government imposed cost controls on Oct. 4 on gasoline and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs.
Reliance's shares plunged 6.9 percent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 percent since their record close on Aug. 28.
The decline has pushed Reliance's market capitalization down to 6.64 trillion rupees ($90.47 billion) and it is no longer India's most valuable company, sitting behind  Tata Consultancy Services  Ltd (NS:TCS) at 6.77 trillion rupees.
The price shock, driven by soaring crude import costs, angered consumers and triggered riots by farmers, forcing the government to react at the cost of its refiners' health.
For now, Reliance is staying with its retail plans despite the recent trouble.
""When prices are cut, you have to effectively match it,"" said Venkatachari Srikanth, Reliance's joint chief financial officer, during their earnings presentation on Oct. 17. ""We are not going to let this alter broadly our strategy on retail petroleum.""
In line with that, Reliance is planning as many as 2,000 retail stations with oil major  BP  (LON:BP) Plc over the next three years, local media reported on Tuesday.
Reliance's domestic push made sense in an Asian fuel market that is increasingly crowded with new refinery capacity from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China.
The new capacity, combined with soaring crude prices, has eroded profit margins for producing refined fuels.
With the domestic market now also under pressure from price controls, some analysts have been spooked.
Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian oil consultancy Trifecta said the government move could ""be disastrous for Reliance.""
The retail move puts Reliance into competition against government controlled refiners like  Bharat Petroleum  Corp (NS:BPCL),  Hindustan Petroleum  Corp (NS:HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp (NS:IOC), the country's biggest refiner.
Reliance's domestic strategy initially won the backing of investors and the retail fuels group was touted by company Chairman Mukesh Ambani in a speech at its annual general meeting in July.
Between January and August, Reliance's shares soared 45 percent, far outpacing the state-owned refiners as well as India's main stock index, the Nifty 50 (NSEI), which gained 12.5 percent.
But rising crude prices (LCOc1), which jumped from under $70 per barrel in early 2018 to around $85 in early October, and a tumbling rupee (INRUSD=R) combined to push domestic fuel prices to records, undermining Reliance's retail strategy despite some relief from a dip in crude prices in recent weeks.
Still, Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president of India's BOB Capital Markets, which has a buy rating on Reliance, said signs of an ""oil price shock"" in India were ""already visible.""
Reliance may gradually mothball its retail stations because of the cost controls, said Macquarie Capital Ltd Analyst Aditya Suresh in a note on Oct. 5, though the bank expects no meaningful impact on its earnings.
EXPORT MARKET & IMO 2020
Reliance may be better placed to thrive on exports despite the increasing competition in Asia and the Middle East.
The company operates the world's biggest refinery complex at the port of Jamnagar in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The first Jamnagar plant can process 663,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude while the second site can process another 709,000 bpd.
Reliance's refining margins last quarter were at a premium of $3.40 per barrel over the average Singapore margin, the benchmark for Asia.
However, the Singapore margin  has dropped by about 50 percent since mid-2017 because of rising crude prices. Reliance also said in its results that fewer refinery outages last quarter meant global run rates were high.
Still, Reliance's refineries benefit from being among the most modern in the world. 
Several units process residual fuel oil, the leftovers after crude oil is initially refined, into higher-value gasoline and distillate products as well as remove pollutants such as sulfur. 
That ability to cut its high-sulfur fuel oil output to nearly nothing while maximizing its diesel fuel output gives Reliance an advantage as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require new low-sulfur fuel oil used in ships starting in 2020.
""IMO regulations are positive because of our mid-distillate configuration,"" said Reliance's Srikanth.
With a move toward cleaner fuels as part of IMO, BOB Capital's Ahuja said Reliance's gross refining margins could rise by up to $5 per barrel. 
Beyond IMO 2020 and the Indian fuel price turmoil, the oil industry is threatened by the rise of electric vehicles and alternative fuels that could reduce oil's use as a transport fuel.
Refiners are looking at petrochemicals to replace potentially lost demand in the transport sector.
""If I have to look at it from a 'oil demand hit from electric vehicles' perspective, it's going to be petrochemicals that's going to survive for them (Reliance) beyond ten years,"" said Ahuja.
Combined, Reliance's refining and marketing group along with its petrochemicals division contribute more than 90 percent of the overall company revenues, its latest annual report showed.
Under Reliance's ""Oil to Chemicals Journey"" strategy the company is seeking to ""upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals"" over the next decade.

""We are focusing to produce and sell at every level,"" said Reliance's Srikanth. ""Between whether to sell domestically or on bulk, whether we will export, every day is an analysis of which is a better option.""

Shares in Hitachi Chemical fell about 10 percent by mid-morning on Monday, losing more than 30 billion yen ($268 million) in market value.
The source, who is not authorized to speak to media on the matter and declined to be identified, said the Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) unit recently notified customers of improper tests.
Local media reported over the weekend that the material, which is used to protect semiconductors from scratches and debris, is used in a wide range of products such as computers and other electronic devices.
The company said in a statement on Saturday that a committee of external experts was investigating the issue and would announce the results as soon as they were available.
The revelations follow Hitachi Chemical's admission in June that it found data falsification in quality tests of lead-acid batteries for industrial use over a period of more than seven years, affecting some 60,000 products shipped to roughly 500 companies.
Other recent compliance failings at Japanese manufacturers include scandals at Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and Subaru Corp (T:7270).
The Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday issued a warning to investors, citing a lack of clarity around the Hitachi Chemical issue.

The transaction is by far IBM's biggest acquisition. It underscores IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty's efforts to expand the company's subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.
IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 63 percent premium to Friday's closing share price.
Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue.
Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow, Rometty, who has been IBM's CEO since 2012, said in an interview with Reuters.
""This acquisition we are clearly doing for growth synergies. This is not about cost synergies at all,"" Rometty said in the interview.
The acquisition illustrates how older technology companies are turning to dealmaking to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing, where customers using enterprise software are seeking to save money by consolidating their vendor relationships.
IBM is hoping the deal will help it catch up with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud business. IBM shares have lost almost a third of their value in the past five years, while Red Hat shares are up 170 percent over the same period.
""This deal represents the culmination of IBM's existing partnership with Red Hat, and, in our view, allows IBM to gain a highly strategic asset to advance its hybrid cloud initiatives,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a research note.
They added that for the deal to work, it was important for IBM to uphold Red Hat's neutrality when it came to operating platforms and maintain Red Hat's open-source and multi-cloud position in the market.
BIG BLUE 
IBM was founded in 1911 and is known in the technology industry as Big Blue, a reference to its once ubiquitous blue computers. It has faced years of revenue declines, as it transitions its legacy computer maker business into new technology products and services. Its recent initiatives have included artificial intelligence and business lines around Watson, named after the supercomputer it developed. 
To be sure, IBM is no stranger to acquisitions. It acquired cloud infrastructure provider Softlayer in 2013 for $2 billion, and the Weather Channel's data assets for more than $2 billion in 2015. It also acquired Canadian business software maker Cognos in 2008 for $5 billion.
Other big technology companies have also recently sought to reinvent themselves through acquisitions. Microsoft this year acquired open source software platform GitHub for $7.5 billion; chip maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc agreed to acquire software maker CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) for nearly $19 billion; and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc agreed to acquire marketing software maker Marketo for $5 billion.
One of IBM's main competitors, Dell Technologies Inc, made a big bet on software and cloud computing two years ago, when it acquired data storage company EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion. As part of that deal, Dell inherited an 82 percent stake in virtualization software company VMware Inc.
The deal between IBM and Red Hat is expected to close in the second half of 2019. IBM said it planned to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 to help pay for the deal.
IBM said Red Hat would continue to be led by Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and Red Hat's current management team. It intends to maintain Red Hat's headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.
Lazard Ltd offered financial advice to IBM, alongside  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which also provided financing for the deal. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP provided legal advice to IBM.
Guggenheim Partners LLC and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were financial advisers to Red Hat, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP offered legal advice to the company on the deal. 

""Knowing first-hand how important open, hybrid cloud technologies are to helping businesses unlock value, we see the power of bringing these two companies together, and are honored to advise IBM and commit financing for this transaction,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

""We will continue to keep the best interests of our employees and clients in mind as we consider alternative options,"" the bank said in a statement.
Accendo said in a statement that it did not agree with the plan to suspend the deal and that it was still analyzing it.
Accendo announced the deal in late 2016 but was forced to put it on hold after a shareholder was arrested in the United States on charges of laundering more than $100 million.

Mexico's banking regulator last year cleared the bank of wrongdoing in connection with the U.S. charges, allowing the acquisition to continue, although it imposed $1.3 million in fines on the bank for lesser violations.

S&P 500 e-mini futures  were 0.09 percent lower by 6:11 p.m. after the open of weekly trading. Nasdaq 100 Index e-mini futures (NQc1) were higher by 0.05 percent.
The S&P 500 ended at its lowest level since early May on Friday and flirted with correction territory after technology and internet shares sold off further, capping another volatile week for U.S. stocks.
During Friday's session, the benchmark S&P 500 fell more than 10 percent from its Sept. 20 record closing high, but pared losses to end above that level. A finish of 10 percent or more below its all-time closing high would confirm a correction.
The Nasdaq registered its biggest weekly drop since March 23 after confirming a correction earlier in the week.
Grim results late on Thursday from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), two stocks that have helped power the equity markets' decade-long bull run, sparked the day's sell-off and overshadowed data showing the U.S. economy growing at a healthy clip.

The group, which opposed Bonderman's re-election at last month's AGM, said it would lobby fellow shareholders to join it to secure the 3 percent of shares required to file a shareholder resolution at the next meeting, due in September 2019. 
The group also plans to file a resolution demanding that succession plans for Chief Executive Michael O'Leary be set out. 
""On the day of Ryanair's first-half results (Oct. 22) Mr O'Leary said Mr Bonderman intends to remain in place for one or two more years and that the company would set out succession plans for Mr O'Leary in the next two or three years,"" the LAPFF said in a statement. 
""Shareholders have made it clear they expect action quicker than this.""
The group said it believed recent staffing and industrial relations issues at Ryanair might have been handled better with a more independent board. 
It said its concerns had been heightened by a profit warning on Oct. 1. when Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent citing damage to bookings from strikes. 
The LAPFF was one of several shareholders to voice concerns at Ryanair's AGM in September, when Bonderman, was re-elected with 70.5 percent of votes, a significant fall from the 89 percent he received the previous year. 
""Ryanair shareholders recently passed all AGM resolutions by a large majority, including the nomination of directors and chairman,"" a Ryanair spokesman said when asked to comment on the LAPFF's plan.
""They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding Chairman like David Bonderman guide the board and the airline."" 

Bonderman, the founder of private equity firm TPG Capital who has chaired Ryanair since 1996, resigned from the board of Uber in 2017 after an ill-judged joke that more women on the board means ""more talking"".

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",UBS may seek clearance to sell more products to U.S. ex-pats in Switzerland,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) may ask U.S. regulators to expand its license to sell more complex products and sophisticated investment advice to wealthy Americans living in Switzerland as it seeks to woo U.S. taxpayers abroad for growth. In an interview published on Sunday, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti told Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung that UBS currently cannot sell some products and investments to U.S. taxpayers in Switzerland.
Ermotti did not specify which products, but a banking source told Reuters they would be investments and advice that UBS's Swiss-based Swiss Financial Advisers unit (SFA), which caters to U.S. taxpayers the country above a certain wealth threshold, cannot offer now.
According to the source, UBS is reviewing options and is likely to approach the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek regulatory permission for some currently off-limits products. 
The source did not name specific products under review.
Expanding UBS's license could help it compete against U.S. rivals just as the largest Swiss bank is seeking more business with wealthy U.S. citizens living abroad, to help accelerate its wealth management business where transaction volumes have been modest.
""Most billionaires are Americans,"" Ermotti said in the newspaper interview. ""We don't want to just cede that business to the U.S. banks."" 
In 2009, UBS paid $780 million to settle a dispute over wealthy Americans who had stashed undeclared money in Swiss accounts.
The source said the limits on what products UBS could offer affluent U.S. taxpayers in Switzerland were not a consequence of that dispute. Rather, its current license with the SEC simply does not cover them.
Ermotti told the newspaper that U.S. banks had worked ""cleverly"" with politicians in that country to take advantage of the tax dispute to advance their commercial interests. 
Still, the Swiss banker said UBS, which maintained a strong U.S. presence even after its settlement, is strong enough to overcome any disadvantage. 
""We have something special to offer,"" he told SonntagsZeitung. ""As David against Goliath, we can do well.""

(This version of the story corrects paragraph 3 to show products and advice in question cannot currently be offered by UBS, clarifies in paragraph 5 that license would help UBS compete against U.S. rivals)

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",France will ask auto makers to fund new car trade-in payments,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will ask carmakers on Monday to help fund an expanded trade-in program to get older, polluting cars off the road with incentives for new ones, the French finance minister told daily Le Parisien on Sunday.
The existing government-funded scrappage scheme, which mainly targets old diesel cars, is already oversubscribed.
The widening of the incentive is partly funded by a hardening of the tax on polluting vehicles adopted on Tuesday, which should raise 40 million euros (35.5 million pounds) to reach a total of 610 million next year to finance contributions for the purchase of more environment-friendly cars.
The minister's agenda says he will hold meetings with Environment Minister Francois de Rugy and carmakers, such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA, to ""discuss measures aimed at speeding up the vehicle fleet's ecological transition.""
""With Francois de Rugy we will ask carmakers tomorrow to contribute to the conversion premium,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Parisien in an interview, adding that the incentive should be more efficient and reach more French people.
The level of carmakers' contribution to the wider scheme would have to be discussed with them, he said.
Newspaper Les Echos earlier this week said French carmakers were already discussing between them the implementation at their expense of a bonus for the conversion of old vehicles. The precise outlines remained under discussion.
There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since leading German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has boosted investment in electric vehicles and incentives for green cars.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners agreed earlier this month on plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes.
But carmakers had said the focus should instead be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices.
Volkswagen on Thursday said it will offer trade-in incentives and a bonus for scrapping older diesel vehicles in Germany.
Separately, Le Maire dismissed calls to reduced taxes on fuel prices which have surged at French petrol stations after a spike in crude oil, saying this would contribute to climate change.

France's 2019 budget includes an increase in diesel taxes of more than 6 cents per liter and those on gasoline by almost 3 cents, an increase that the government has tried to downplay, comparing it to soaring oil prices.

The tweet, sent late Friday evening less than an hour before Musk tweeted that he would take a break from Twitter ""for a few days,"" was in response to a question from a Twitter follower.
The SEC in September charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuing market chaos hurt investors, regulators claimed.
Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement.
Under the settlement agreement, Tesla needs to appoint an independent chairman by Nov. 13.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>",Tesla says has not received subpoena on Model 3 production,"By Alexandria Sage and Arjun Panchadar
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has not received a U.S. subpoena related to its Model 3 production forecasts, the electric carmaker said on Friday, following a report that it faced a deepening criminal probe about the projections.
The company has cooperated in responding to what it called a ""voluntary request"" for documents from the Department of Justice in September, a Tesla spokesperson said. The agency has the ability to press criminal charges.
""We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months,"" the spokesperson said in an email.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether Tesla misstated information about the production of its Model 3 sedans and misled investors about its business going back to early 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
In recent weeks, FBI agents have contacted former Tesla employees to seek testimony in the criminal case, according to the report. The ex-employees received subpoenas earlier in the probe, and FBI agents recently have sought to interview a number of them, the sources said. 
Any focus on Tesla's past statements about Model 3 production targets would broaden the probe by the agency, which Tesla said last month was looking at statements made by Chief Executive Elon Musk about a go-private deal that was later called off.
Tesla first disclosed in September that the DoJ was investigating Musk's tweets about having ""funding secured"" for a deal to take Tesla private, saying the agency had asked for documents about such statements.
Any expansion of the FBI's probe comes as Musk faces pressure to deliver consistent production of the Model 3 at a profit. The company on Wednesday posted a profit and positive cash flow, making good on pledges made by Musk earlier this year, as the company ramps up volume of its new sedan.
MODEL 3 CHALLENGES
Tesla and Musk already face a proposed class action shareholder lawsuit claiming that the company and its top executives made false statements about the readiness of the Model 3 for volume production. 
The car, which the money-losing company is banking on to turn a profit, was introduced to the public in early 2016 to great fanfare, with repeated promises throughout 2017 that Tesla was ""on track"" to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of that year at its factory in Fremont, California.
Such statements were fraudulent, according to the lawsuit, given that the automated assembly lines to build the car in such volume were behind schedule. 
Tesla has denied the claims in the lawsuit, saying it disclosed production bottlenecks once they were identified, and citing Musk's public statements that the company was undergoing a period of ""production hell"" in 2017. 
Tesla only reached a goal to build 5,000 Model 3s per week in June, although current production has fallen short of that.
Musk and Tesla only recently settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk's Aug. 7 tweets. The SEC sued him for fraud, calling his claims ""false and misleading,"" before reaching a settlement.
Both Tesla and Musk must pay a $20 million fine, and Musk must give up his chairman role for three years as the company appoints an independent chair.
Shares of Tesla rose 4.5 to $329, extending their rally following bullish results on Wednesday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Robots will make robots at a new ABB (S:ABBN) factory in China, which the Swiss engineering group said on Saturday it plans to build for $150 million in Shanghai as it defends its place as the country's largest maker of industrial robots.
The factory, located near ABB's China robotics campus, is due to be operating by the end of 2020 and will produce robots for China as well as for export elsewhere in Asia. China is ABB's No. 2 market after the United States.
""Shanghai has become a vital center for advanced technology leadership – for ABB and the world,"" ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a statement announcing the project. 
With the expansion, ABB is banking on Chinese robots sales defying concerns over trade tensions with the United States that some fear could dent demand for electronics, auto parts and other items that require automated manufacturing and robots.
China is expanding its robot workforce, as wages for human workers there rise and the country seeks to compete with lower-cost countries via greater automation. In 2017, one of every three robots sold in the world went to China, which purchased nearly 138,000 units, ABB said.
ABB's new 75,000-square-foot factory will use software meant to allow people and robots to work safely in close proximity, the company said, adding its YuMi robots -- designed to work side-by-side with people -- will also be deployed on many of the small parts assembly tasks needed to manufacture an ABB robot.
Rival  Kuka  (DE:KU2G), taken over in 2016 by China's Midea (SZ:000333) two years ago, has also been expanding in the country, including by building a robot park in Shunde near Hong Kong. 
ABB, whose industrial robots are used, among other things, to build automobiles as well as to assemble electronic devices, will build robots for numerous industries at the Shanghai factory, a spokesman said. 
It did not give a new employee count for the factory, but said it will boost robotics employment that now sits at more than 2,000 ABB workers in China.

The Beijing branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said unrealized losses or lending risks associated with shares that banks hold as collateral against loans will not be part of regulatory inspections, according to Yicai.

CBIRC could not immediately be reached outside normal business hours. 
In the past week, China has unveiled a series of measures to ease liquidity pressure at small and medium-sized enterprises struggling in a slowing economy clouded by the broadening Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Underscoring the liquidity stress, about $620 billion of Chinese shares have been pledged for loans, putting companies under pressure as stock markets tumble and the prospect of forced liquidation rises.

According to Yicai, lenders in Beijing have been urged to set up a dynamic mechanism to monitor risks of pledged shares and to defuse risks in a stable and orderly manner.

Apple and Qualcomm are involved in a series legal actions. Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world's largest mobile phone chip supplier, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.
Qualcomm made its comments about the size of Apple's unpaid royalties in a hearing in one of the cases in federal court in San Diego. Apple has disputed the amount of royalties that it owes to Qualcomm.

Apple has argued that Qualcomm is forcing it to pay for the same patents twice, once when Apple uses Qualcomm's chip in iPhones and then again through patent royalties. Qualcomm has argued that its practices are legal and that Apple is seeking to destroy Qualcomm's business model after agreeing to it for years.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Friday he was satisfied with pilot contract language governing the outsourcing of regional flights and does not see it becoming an issue during upcoming negotiations.
Bastian said he was ""happy with existing"" language, or scope clauses, which set guidelines on the size of planes that can be operated by regional feeder carriers, among other things.
Commercial planemakers are closely watching for any change in pilot scope clauses, which bar planes heavier than 86,000 pounds (39,000 kg) with more than 76 seats from regional routes, where pilots are generally paid less than their mainline counterparts. Pilots are fiercely opposed to any changes.
Delta's contract with its pilots becomes amendable in 2019.
Bastian was speaking at a Montreal-area factory run by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) as the No. 2 U.S. carrier takes delivery of its first A220 jet. 
The 110-seat narrowbody aircraft will serve as a ""cornerstone of domestic growth"" on the carrier's mainline routes, Bastian said. 
United Airlines (O:UAL) has already faced pushback from pilots after asking for changes to its scope clauses.
American Airlines (O:AAL) pilots are not expecting any demands from the carrier to change scope clauses when negotiations kick off in January 2019, said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for their union, the Allied Pilots Association. 
Scope clauses have become an issue for Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) of Japan, which are building new planes that are too heavy to be flown by regional carriers because they exceed the weight requirement. 

Earlier this month, Embraer said it removed a 100-plane order from its backlog due to uncertainty about whether pilots would agree to fly its E175-E2 for U.S. regional carriers, because the plane exceeded scope weight limits.

BEIJING/CHICAGO/CARAMBEI, Brazil (Reuters) - Ken Maschhoff, chairman of the largest U.S. family-owned pork producer, has watched profits fall as trade tensions rise between the United States and China.
His company, The Maschhoffs, has halted U.S. projects worth up to $30 million and may move some operations overseas. Investing in domestic operations now would be “ludicrous"" as China and others retaliate against U.S. agricultural goods, Maschhoff said from the firm’s Carlyle, Illinois headquarters.
Across the globe, Chinese pig farmer Xie Yingqiang sent most of his 1,000-pig herd to slaughter in May to limit losses after Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans hiked feed prices and left him unable to cover his costs.
""It did not really make sense to keep raising them,"" said Xie, from eastern Jiangsu province.
The dueling salvos of the U.S.-China trade war are landing particularly hard on the pork industries of both nations – and spraying shrapnel that has damaged other major pork exporters such as Brazil, Canada and top European producers. In contrast to many industries that trade war has divided into winners and losers, the world’s pork farmers and processors are almost universally shedding profits and jobs from a crippling combination of rising feed costs and sinking pig prices. 
The key reason: The trade war came at precisely the wrong time, after a worldwide expansion to record pork production levels on the expectation of rising meat demand and low feed prices from a global grains glut.
In the United States, meat companies such as Seaboard Triumph Foods (A:SEB) and Prestage Farms have spent hundreds of millions of dollars boosting U.S. slaughter capacity by more than 10 percent from three years ago to nearly half a million hogs daily.
Just before trade barriers went up, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicted in an April analysis that global supply growth would outpace demand this year, sparking “fierce competition and lower prices.” Tariff battles accelerated those trends by shutting off export markets, raising feed prices and upending regional supply-and-demand dynamics that underpinned industry profits.
""As this trade war has heated up, it's made the trade with China very difficult - to even stopping at various points - because the tariff that's been imposed makes it not viable,"" Kenneth Sullivan, chief executive of Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL], the world's largest pork producer and a division of China's WH Group (HK:0288), told Reuters in an interview Friday.
""We're keenly interested in the U.S. and China getting it resolved,"" Sullivan said, adding that expansion of the U.S. pork industry had also hurt profitability. ""Certainly U.S. agriculture has a lot at stake, and China, to the extent that they're on the surplus end of the deficit, has you can argue more at stake.""
U.S. pork faces retaliatory duties of 62 percent in China and up to 20 percent in Mexico, slashing demand from two top U.S. pork export markets and contributing to a mountain of unsold meat in cold storage.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
The USDA said in a statement that pork producers soymeal costs have declined because of a surplus of domestic soybeans that China is no longer buying. The Trump administration is working to increase opportunities for U.S. agriculture with the European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom, the agency said.
In China, tariffs on U.S. soybeans and an outbreak of African swine flu have driven farmers to send hogs for an early slaughter, exacerbating a glut that followed the rapid expansion of more efficient, large-scale farms in recent years. 
Higher domestic supply and rising imports from other suppliers, such as Spain and Brazil, has compensated for the slide in U.S. pork imports. But an African swine fever outbreak this year has added to the problems of China’s pork producers. More than 40 cases have been reported in 13 provinces so far, and restrictions on hog transportation to control the disease have resulted in a glut in some northern provinces and a shortage in the south.
Brazil’s pork industry has suffered higher feed prices partly because farmers now must compete with major Chinese soybean buyers who turned to Brazil to avoid tariffs on U.S. beans.
In Canada, the world’s third largest exporter, producers’ fortunes have fallen along with the U.S. because their prices are tied to that much larger market. In August, prices fell 31 percent less than the previous month, according to data compiled by Hams Marketing Services.
Manitoba farmer George Matheson now expects to sell his about 250 pigs for C$115 per head - well short of the C$150 it costs to raise them.
""I had a hunch this would not be a good thing,"" his said of the trade disputes.
RISING COSTS, FALLING PROFITS
Many farmers in China are searching for cheaper protein-rich ingredients to replace soymeal, such as rapeseed or yellow peas. 
""Everything I use is becoming more expensive,” said Yu Shiqian, who raises 1,800 hogs in northeastern Liaoning province. “Only the hog price is declining."" 
Big producers are also being hit hard. 
Hong Kong-based WH Group (HK:0288), the world's top pork producer, which also owns U.S. giant Smithfield, warned earlier this year that its biggest challenge is the oversupply of meat in the United States and uncertainty over trade tensions.
Top Chinese producers Muyuan Foods Co Ltd (SZ:002714),  Guangdong Wens Foodstuff  Group Co Ltd (SZ:300498) and Beijing Dabeinong Technology (SZ:002385), reported their worst earnings in years in the second quarter due to weak hog prices. Dabeinong also blamed high raw material prices for eroding margins in its feed business. 
Xie had hoped to rebuild his herd after the summer but instead “decided to stay away from the pig business for a while.” 
""At least I can guarantee I don't lose money this way,” he said.
A ‘RED YEAR’
In Iowa, the top U.S. pork-producing state, trade disputes will cause hog farmers to lose $18 per head, or $800 million in total revenue from August 2018 to July 2019, Iowa State University economists predicted in September.
For The Maschhoffs, the estimated loss equates to $100 million.
“We were going to make money in ‘18 and ’19, and now we're going to have a red year,” Maschhoff said. 
The company considered investing in China, Eastern Europe and South America in recent years but shelved the plans because they could more efficiently raise pigs in the United States.
""We're starting to scratch our heads and say, 'Did we make the right decision?’"" he said. 
Producers have scaled back expansion plans because of the trade war, said Barry Kerkaert, a vice president at Minnesota-based Pipestone System, which annually sells farmers about 250,000 sows. 
In Lone Rock, Iowa, a town of about 200 people, Roger Cherland raises 3,000 sows. Housed in long barns, the swine jostle for space next to feed bins topped off by machines. The Cherlands’ hogs fetched about $40 per hundred pounds in August - about $20 less than their break-even price.
""We've got way too many pigs right now,” Cherland said of U.S. farmers.
A RUN ON SOY IN BRAZIL
In Europe, big pork exporters such as Spain and Germany, have made some additional sales to China and Mexico since the trade wars escalated this year. But the new sales have not been enough to support EU prices because of expanded domestic supply and because China bought less pork earlier this year than in past years.
Pig farmers in Brazil, the world’s fourth largest producer and exporter, also might have been well-positioned to capitalize on a U.S.-China trade war by boosting sales to China. But that has hardly offset the damage from higher feed prices and a host of domestic problems that are hurting exports, driving up domestic supply and slashing prices.
Russia, which until recently bought nearly 40 percent of Brazilian pork exports, imposed a ban in December after discovering traces of the prohibited food additive ractopamine. And the European Union banned imports from 20 Brazilian meat plants, mainly poultry suppliers, due to alleged deficiencies in the nation’s health inspection system.
Brazil’s pig farmers normally can buy cheap local soybeans, a key ingredient in animal feed, because the nation is the world’s second-largest soy producer - but now they pay record prices in part because of the rush of Chinese buyers. 
Wilant Boogaard, a hog farmer in Paraná, operates as a member of a cooperative, a scheme that guarantees his production costs are covered by an associated meat processor. 
But as partners in the processing business, the cooperative’s farmers have a 40 percent stake, leaving them on the hook for losses. 
""The meat-packer is losing money,"" he said. ""If we manage to survive, it will be a great thing.”

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:54PM ET</span>","S&P 500 ends at lowest since May as tech, internet stocks tumble","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended at its lowest level since early May on Friday and flirted with correction territory after technology and internet shares sold off further, capping another volatile week for U.S. stocks.
During the session, the benchmark S&P 500 fell more than 10 percent from its Sept. 20 record closing high, but pared losses to end above that level. A finish of 10 percent or more below its all-time closing high would confirm a correction.
The Nasdaq registered its biggest weekly drop since March 23 after confirming a correction earlier in the week.
Grim results late Thursday from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run, sparked the day's selloff and overshadowed data showing the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy clip.
""It's all been driven off quarter reporting,"" said Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. ""When the reports are bad in technology you get a really bad day because of the elevated valuations.""
Investors may see more volatility through the remainder of the U.S. earnings season and ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm congressional elections, he and other money managers said. 
""Once the elections and earnings are out of the way, we'll have a calmer market but not necessarily a big move up,"" Ramos said. 
Google-parent Alphabet's revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth. The stock fell as much as 5.6 percent before recovering to end down just 1.8 percent.
Amazon tumbled 7.8 percent in its worst daily percentage drop since October 2014, after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 296.24 points, or 1.19 percent, to 24,688.31, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 46.88 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,658.69 the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 151.12 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,167.21.
The Dow and the S&P 500 both returned to negative territory for the year.
The Nasdaq fell 3.8 percent for the week, while the Dow was down 3 percent and the S&P 500 was down 4 percent on the week.
While economic growth is mostly healthy, disappointing corporate results and forecasts this earnings season have shown how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies.
Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy pace, offering some support. 
U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed gauge of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, finished little changed at 24.16.
Market participants say a healthy level of hedging activity going into the sell-off and the recent upward bid for Treasury prices explains the volatility index's relative calm.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, said while he expects further downside in stocks, many investors still appear to be looking for chances to buy. 
""Most people I would argue are sitting around talking about where do we buy. They look at this still more as a buying opportunity than a risk,"" he said.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), the other members of the so-called FAANG group, were also sharply lower. The S&P discretionary index (SPLRCD) fell 3.6 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.68-to-1 ratio, while on Nasdaq a 2.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 88 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 323 new lows.

About 10.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:27PM ET</span>",Fitch says it no longer assumes Britain will get a smooth Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ratings agency Fitch said on Friday it no longer assumed that Britain would leave the European Union in a smooth transition and said a ""no deal"" Brexit could lead to a further downgrade of its sovereign credit rating.
""In Fitch's view, an intensification of political divisions within the UK ... has increased the likelihood of an acrimonious and disruptive 'no deal' Brexit.
""Such an outcome would substantially disrupt customs, trade and economic activity, and has led Fitch to abandon its base case on which the ratings were previously predicated.""
Previously Fitch had assumed Britain would leave the EU in March next year with a transition deal in place and the outline of a future trade deal with the bloc.
But Prime Minister Theresa May has struggled to agree a deal that can secure the backing of Brussels and her own lawmakers in the Conservative Party. 
Fitch currently rates British government debt at AA with a negative outlook, which means a further lowering of the rating is possible. Fitch cut its top-notch AAA rating on Britain in 2013, citing the outlook for weaker public finances.
S&P Global Ratings separately affirmed its ratings on the UK, with a negative outlook.
""The ratings are constrained by the uncertainty regarding the UK's exit from and future relationship with the EU, which in our opinion will have important implications for its economy, its ability to attract inflows of capital and labor over time, and its public and external finances,"" S&P said.
Ratings downgrades up to now have had little impact on investors' appetite for British government debt, which is still seen as a safe asset at times of political or economic turmoil.
But downgrades are embarrassing for May's Conservative government, which emphasized preserving the country's AAA rating when it embarked on an austerity program in 2010.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:24PM ET</span>",Global oil pricing worries hit U.S. energy shares as earnings loom,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over global oil pricing and pipeline constraints are hanging over the energy sector as U.S. companies begin to report quarterly results, with many producers' shares trading lower on the year. 
Third-quarter profits for oil producers generally should be higher than a year ago, because the average price per barrel was up about 44 percent over the same period last year. But oil prices on Friday registered their third straight weekly decline, extending a slide on concerns that slower global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade war could dent demand. 
U.S. crude (CLc1) is on track for a decline of roughly 8 percent for the month, while the S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) is down 12.2 percent so far in October compared with the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) 8.8 percent decline. (N) 
U.S. crude prices (CLc1) averaged $69.43 a barrel in the third quarter, up sharply from $48.20 a year earlier. Analysts expect this helped boost S&P 500 energy companies' quarterly earnings 102.9 percent, the biggest expected year-over-year growth among sectors, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
That would be the biggest expected year-over-year percentage growth of any sector for the quarter. Still, some investors say it may not be enough to reverse the trend in shares given trade and other worries. 
""I expect earnings will be good because the last quarter's prices were good,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
But, ""it has been very difficult for these companies to forecast pricing because it has been so volatile,"" he said. Companies that provide drilling and other work for U.S. producers have blamed a near-term slowdown in services demand due to pipeline and other constraints, particularly in the West Texas shale fields. 
While U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil exports could support prices in the coming months, top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia have been signaling they expect to increase production, which should limit increases. 
Upcoming earnings reports, with  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) both due Nov. 2, could reflect those issues. Exxon is down nearly 9 percent for the month to date, while Chevron also is down almost 9 percent. 
""We've seen oil prices sell off here throughout the correction we've had in the broad market. The concern in the sell-off is clearly global growth, and that's immediately reflected in oil prices,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
UBS analysts expect oil demand to grow more slowly in 2019, on higher oil prices and weaker economic growth.
Another producer,  Hess Corp  (N:HES), is due to report Wednesday, while ConocoPhillips (N:COP), the world's largest independent oil and gas producer, beat analysts' estimates for profit in the third quarter when it reported Thursday, citing higher oil prices but also cost cuts.
Recent losses aside, some equity strategists consider oil to be in a bullish cycle and expect prices to rise further over the next year. 
Energy shares have sharply underperformed oil prices so far this year, suggesting there is room for shares to rise further. 
""People are still thinking we're at $40 a barrel oil. We're not,"" said Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which owns shale producer Diamondback Energy (O:FANG) and other names. 
""People are misjudging the balance between supply and demand,"" said Lutts, who sees oil prices heading toward $80 to $90 a barrel within a year. U.S. crude settled at $67.59 on Friday. 
Even with the recent selloff, U.S. oil prices (CLc1) are up roughly 11 percent for the year to date, while the S&P 500 energy index is down about 8 percent for 2018 and market leader Exxon is down about 7 percent.
Some money managers also consider energy shares to be more attractive buys now, with investors fleeing high-flying technology and Internet names in the recent stock market sell-off and seeking value-oriented names. 
Others say it is still too soon for a bullish call on energy.
""To get a sustained move in oil stocks, where they consistently outperform other sectors and where the sector is actually growing as a component of the S&P 500, you need a lot of things like the supply constraint and global growth. 

We're not there right now,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

1233,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Falls Nearly 300 Points as Red October Continues,"Investing.com - The Dow tumbled on Friday, shrugging off data showing ongoing U.S. economic growth as high-flying tech companies were punished in the wake of downbeat reports from Google and Amazon.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1.19%. The S&P 500 fell 1.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.07%. The three indexes are on track for their worst month in years.
Investors grappled with wild swings on Wall Street amid growing concerns U.S. corporates were approaching peak profit growth after tech heavyweights Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered underwhelming quarterly reports and signalled a softer patch of growth for the fourth quarter.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 1.80% after it posted third-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations. Amazon shares, meanwhile, dropped nearly 8% as its third-quarter revenue also fell short, while its weaker-than-expected guidance for the key holiday season exacerbated concerns.
The S&P 500 tech sector closed about 2% lower, while the communication services sector, which includes Netflix, Facebook, Alphabet and telecom companies sunk more than 2%.
The pair of downbeat reports overshadowed data showing the U.S. economy grew 3.5% in the third quarter, above economists' estimates for a 3.3% increase, though analysts said a deeper look into the data revealed signs of a possible slowdown.
Disappointing business investment suggested ""the boost in capex from tax cuts and deregulation was likely front-loaded and fading quickly,"" BNP Paribas said. ""We continue to expect growth to slow from here as the sugar high in consumer spending turns into a sugar low.""
Energy, meanwhile, was also caught up in the selling frenzy, falling nearly 1%, exacerbating the decline in the broader market as a rise in oil prices Friday failed to offset a loss of more than  3% for the week.
Building-products companies were also under pressure, led by a more-than-20% drop in shares of  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) after its third-quarter earnings came up short of estimates and fourth-quarter earnings per share guidance of $2.45 to $2.60 was nearly 30% below the consensus estimate at the midpoint.
Shares of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS) and  Johnson Controls  International (NYSE:JCI) also fell.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) retreated from session highs, but still managed a 5% gain, shrugging off a report from the WSJ claiming the FBI launched a criminal probe into whether the electric automaker had misstated production figures and misled investors.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) regained its spot as the second most valuable U.S. company on Friday after a disappointing quarterly report from Amazon.com (O:AMZN) wiped $65 billion off the online retailer's market capitalization.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) tops the list at over $1 trillion after crossing that threshold in September. Microsoft's market capitalization was Wall Street's highest in late 1998 through early 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst. 
Amazon's shares dropped 7 percent, the most in nearly three years after its holiday season sales outlook missed targets, fanning concerns that Wall Street's tech darlings are finally starting to face stronger competition.
Microsoft fell a more modest 1.1 percent in a broad technology sell-off that was also driven by a weaker-than-expected report from Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), leaving the Nasdaq composite index (IXIC) down 1.9 percent late Friday afternoon.
(Graphic: Market cap - Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ORT0Yq)
Shares of Microsoft remain up nearly 4 percent from Wednesday, when the four-decade-old software company beat quarterly profit expectations, driven by its cloud computing business that competes with Amazon's.
Its stock market value on Friday stood at $823 billion, on track to close above Amazon's for the first time since April, when it gave up its spot as second largest company by market capitalization.
Amazon was worth $805 billion on Friday, after falling below Microsoft's in extended trade on Thursday. The drop was equivalent to the combined values of  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and  Corning Inc  (N:GLW). 
Amazon's tumble left it up around 40 percent year to date, while Microsoft has gained about 25 percent in 2018. On Wednesday, Amazon's stock traded at the equivalent of 70 times expected earnings, its lowest level since 2011.
The average analyst price target for Microsoft puts its market cap at $963 billion, while the average price target for Amazon values it at $1.068 trillion.
Apple will report quarterly results on November 1.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S. loans hold strong amid rising equity volatility,"By Yun Li
NEW YORK (LPC) - Leveraged loans are standing out as the best-performing asset class in an otherwise brutal October as rising volatility in global equities has rippled across the capital markets. 
While investors pulled US$7.4m from loan funds in the week ending October 24, the first week of outflows in four months, the asset class has been largely unfazed by the risk-off sentiment created by the deepening stock market rout.
US equities renewed their sell-off on Friday on disappointing reports from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The S&P 500 Index and the Dow have wiped out their gains in 2018, while the Nasdaq entered the correction territory, Reuters reported.
Average bids for US loans, meanwhile, held steady at 98.87 on October 25, only slightly down from 98.91 on October 1, according to LPC data. Around 43% of US loans are now trading above par, or above face value, compared to only 23% in July, as demand for floating rate assets remains high in a rising interest rate environment.
“Investors are shifting their portfolio allocations away from public equities and are [going] back into floating-rate loans,” said Kimberly Flynn, managing director at XA Investments. “With concerns about rising interest rates, investors who are making [adjustments] in their equity portfolios are not moving back into investment grade or high yield fixed income. Loans are benefiting from this.”
Equity volatility has spilled into the credit markets. The interest rate-sensitive high yield bond market has traded lower by about 1% in October, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) US High Yield Index.
Despite October’s bout of risk aversion, the loan market is significantly outperforming equities and bonds with gains of +0.18% in October beating the S&P 500 (-8.8%), high yield bonds (-1.22%), and investment grade bonds (-0.87%), JP Morgan analyst Peter Acciavatti said in an October 25 note.
FLOATING-RATE DEMAND
Loan funds have seen US$16.8bn of inflows in the year to date, while high-yield bond funds have seen outflows of US$28.7bn as rising interest rates eat into returns. Loans, whose prices go up as interest rates rise, have seen inflows in 37 of the last 39 weeks.
Such is the demand for floating rate debt that several loan repricing deals started trading in the US secondary market this week and were quoted as high as 101.
Staffing services company EmployBridge's US$485m repriced term loan B opened at 100.75-101.25 on Wednesday after going free to trade. The company priced the deal at 450bp over Libor with a 1% Libor floor at par, which cut 50bp from the spread on its existing loan.
Specialized hospital and outpatient care provider Select Medical's repriced US$1.133bn term loan was quoted at 100.375-100.75 when it broke for trading on October 22. The deal will save the company 25bp by pricing at 250bp over Libor with a 0% floor, compared to 275bp over Libor previously.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 02:49PM ET</span>",NBC says 'Megyn Kelly Today' not returning to the air,"By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Television anchor Megyn Kelly's NBC morning show ""Megyn Kelly Today"" will not return to the air, NBC News said in an emailed statement on Friday.
Earlier this week, Kelly sparked widespread criticism by defending the use of blackface as part of Halloween costumes during remarks on the show. 
Kelly apologized for the comments on the air, but the network began airing taped episodes of her normally live show on Thursday. 
Kelly, 47, remains an employee of NBC News and ""discussions about next steps are continuing,"" her attorney, Bryan Freedman, said in a statement on Friday. According to a ""Today"" show report on Friday, NBC executives and Kelly's representatives were in negotiations about her departure and her remaining three-year $69 million contract.
NBC hired Kelly in January 2017 after she rose to fame on 21st Century Fox's cable channel Fox News. At the time, her contract at Fox was up for renewal and she said she was searching for new opportunities.
Next week, other Today show co-anchors will host during the 9 a.m. hour that had belonged to Kelly, NBC News said.
Kelly made her controversial remarks on her show on Tuesday. ""What is racist? Because you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for Halloween or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween,"" she said. ""When I was a kid, that was OK as long as you were dressing up like a character.""
Kelly apologized on air the next day, saying, ""I was wrong, and I am sorry."" 
NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack condemned the remarks in a staff meeting, according to a report on the network's ""Today"" morning show on Friday.
Last September, Kelly caused a furor when she interviewed actress Jane Fonda and quizzed her about plastic surgery. She was criticized for interviewing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has said the 2012 Connecticut school shooting a hoax. 

Despite her high-profile hiring, Kelly has failed to boost audiences. According to Nielsen ratings data, ""Megyn Kelly Today"" drew an average audience of 2.3 million in the 12 months to September 2018, compared to 2.8 million for ""Today's Take"" that was hosted by Al Roker and Tamron Hall and replaced by Kelly's show.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil will leave a decision on whether to approve the sale of a controlling stake in planemaker Embraer SA's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jet business to  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to the next government, Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna told Reuters on Friday.
That's a reversal from Luna's remarks in August, when he said that current President Michel Temer's administration would reach a decision after elections conclude this Sunday but before the Jan. 1 transition to the next government.
Embraer and Boeing agreed in July to the deal, but Brazil's government, which owns a special class of stock in the planemaker that allows it to veto significant business decisions, has yet to sign off on it.
Luna said negotiations on final details of the deal had reached a stalemate due to the electoral uncertainty. The expectation now is that discussions will accelerate once a president has been elected. 
""But that doesn't mean it's not going to come through,"" Luna said of the deal. 
Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate widely expected to win the election on Sunday by a large margin, has said in the past that he is in favor of the deal. His rival, left-wing Fernando Haddad, has spoken against it. 
Luna said that the deal would probably be presented by the current government to the transition team appointed by the future president-elect. 
""We will surely be calling the transition team to talk about the deal, and the idea is to present everything with clarity and transparency,"" Luna said. 
Under the terms of the proposed deal, Boeing will pay $3.8 billion to own 80 percent of a new joint venture that will hold Embraer's commercial jet business. Embraer will be left with its private jet and defense divisions.

 Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) fell 20% after its third-quarter earnings came up short of estimates and fourth-quarter earnings per share guidance of $2.45 to $2.60 was nearly 30% below the consensus estimate at the midpoint.
The flooring company blamed the results on weakening demand, inflation and pricing pressures, compressed margins owing to rising competition, a declining product mix and lower manufacturing rates.
Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) gave up its gains from a day earlier, when it missed consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines and slashed fourth-quarter earnings guidance, blaming lower-than-previously-expected sales in automotive, higher costs and weaker sales in home furniture.
 Weyerhaeuser  (NYSE:WY), meanwhile, fell 6% after delivering third-quarter sales and profit significantly below analysts' estimates. It guided fourth-quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA below third-quarter levels, citing lower average sales realizations in the West and slightly higher fee harvest volumes and comparable average log sales realizations in the South.
The trio of results underscored the dour state of the U.S. housing market, pressured by both surging input costs and mortgage rates, which climbed to 5% this month for the first time since 2011."

The FBI were reviewing Tesla's stated Model 3 numbers going back to early 2017, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources.
Shares of Tesla nosedived on the news, but have since pared losses to trade 3.5% higher.
In a response to the WSJ report, Tesla blamed difficulties in its production ramp for the delay in meeting its 5,000-unit-per-week guidance.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three former London-based currency traders were found not guilty on Friday of U.S. charges that they schemed to rig benchmark exchange rates, the latest criminal convictions to emerge from a U.S. probe into the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market.
Chris Ashton, Rohan Ramchandani and Richard Usher, who worked at  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), respectively, were acquitted of all charges by a jury in Manhattan federal court after a trial of conspiring to violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.
""Delighted with the verdict,"" Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher, told reporters outside the courtroom. ""Richard can now go home to his lovely family.""
""Chris Ashton and his trial team are extremely grateful for the jury’s decision in the case,"" David Schertler, one of Ashton's lawyers, said in an email. ""We were firmly convinced of Chris’s innocence from the outset.""
A lawyer for Ramchandani declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. prosecutors announced the charges in January 2017, and the three came to the United States to face them voluntarily.
Prosecutors said the three traders and others colluded to influence daily benchmark euro-dollar rates, known as ""fixes,"" in order to benefit their own trading positions. They said the scheme ran from 2007 to 2013.
The traders used a chatroom they dubbed ""the cartel"" to exchange information, according to prosecutors.
During a two-week trial, jurors heard testimony from former  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) trader Matt Gardiner, who said he took part in the chats and helped rig the fixes. Gardiner testified as part of an agreement with authorities to avoid prosecution.
Lawyers for the three defendants argued at the trial that there was nothing illegal about competing traders exchanging information about their positions.
The case followed worldwide investigations that resulted in about $10 billion in fines for large banks.
Several others have been charged in the U.S. probe, including Mark Johnson, a former head of foreign exchange cash trading at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), who was sentenced to two years in prison in April after being found guilty by a jury, and former Barclays trader Jason Katz, who pleaded guilty and faces sentencing next year.
Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan,  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) all entered related guilty pleas, and were collectively fined more than $2.8 billion.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo hit with lawsuit over robocalls to wrong numbers,"By Dena Aubin
, (Reuters) - A proposed class action lawsuit in San Francisco federal court accuses  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) of making tens of thousands of automatically dialed, or ""robo,"" calls to cell phones without consumers' consent.
Filed on Thursday on behalf of a nationwide class, the lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of calling wrong numbers with auto-dialing equipment and failing to honor requests to stop. The complaint seeks triple damages under the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or up to $1,500 for each call.
A spokesman for Wells Fargo could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The lawsuit makes use of a recent 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Marks v Crunch San Diego, a consumer class action against a gym operator. That decision broadened the definition of automatically dialed calls, which are barred by the TCPA if made to cell phones. 
Previously, autodialers were defined as devices that randomly generate phone numbers and call them. But the 9th Circuit on Sept. 20 ruled that the definition also includes equipment that automatically dials numbers stored on a list. 
The 9th Circuit's ruling sparked an outcry from business groups, which have been urging the Federal Communications Commissions to issue an interpretative rule restoring a narrower definition of an auto dialer.
In a comment letter to the FCC on Oct. 24, the American Bankers Association said the 9th Circuit's ruling ignores Congress' intent in restricting auto-dialing when it passed the TCPA in 1991. Congress meant to ban mass calls to random numbers, not calls to lists of a company's customers or similar stored numbers, the ABA said.
Citing the 9th Circuit's decision, Thursday's lawsuit said Wells Fargo's equipment meets the definition of an automatic dialing system because it automatically dials numbers from stored lists. Wells Fargo often leaves prerecorded messages on cell phones, which is also barred by the TCPA, the lawsuit alleged.
The lawsuit was filed by Michigan resident Lisa Barnes, who alleged that Wells Fargo began calling her cell phone in 2016 asking to speak to a Richard Loutman, a man Barnes did not know. 
Barnes was never a Wells Fargo customer and did not consent to be called, the complaint said. Barnes asked Wells to stop calling, but the calls continued, her lawsuit said.
The Federal Communications Commission has been reconsidering its rules on auto dialers since May, when it issued a notice seeking comments.
The case is Barnes v Wells Fargo Bank, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No 18-6520

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared himself in economic ""repair mode"" at a major investment conference on Friday as the country raised a total of $55 billion from investors to help haul itself out of recession.
The former union leader, who inherited a mismanaged economy from the scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma earlier this year, wants $100 billion of new investments over the next five years. 
Investment commitments of almost 290 billion rand ($20 billion) were made at the conference, Ramaphosa said. 
He had already secured pledges for some $35 billion, mainly from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Ramaphosa has made reviving the economy a top priority since assuming power in February, but has been hampered by fiscal constraints and infighting in the ruling African National Congress.
""We are in repair mode,"" Ramaphosa said in his opening speech at the conference, which looked at opportunities in sectors including agriculture, manufacturing and energy.
Ramaphosa said the promised investments would give the country a lift.
""We have witnessed today the beginning of a new narrative about investing in South Africa,"" he said in his closing remarks. ""Today I can say the investment strike is over.""
Analysts have said investors held back during Zuma's rule.
PROPERTY RIGHTS COMMITMENT
Several companies across various sectors made the pledges, including  Anglo American  (L:AAL), one of the world's largest commodities miners, which said it would spend 71.5 billion rand ($5 billion) in the country over the next five years. 
South Africa's association of car makers, which includes Nissan (T:7201), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Isuzu (T:7202), said its members would invest more than 40 billion rand over the next five years, while Telecoms firm Vodacom (J:VODJ) pledged to invest 50 billion rand over the same period.
Investors welcomed Ramaphosa's rise to the presidency partly due to his strong ties to the business community. Since then, however, the economy has sunk into recession and faced a series of downbeat data.
His government's policy of land expropriation without compensation, aimed at addressing racial inequalities that remain more than two decades after the fall of apartheid, has also unnerved investors.
Ramaphosa tried to soothe their concerns about the land policy. ""I want to reaffirm that South Africa is very, very committed to property rights,"" he said, without elaborating.
The investment conference follows a jobs summit earlier this month at which Ramaphosa announced a wide-ranging set of deals between government, big business and labor which he said would create 275,000 more jobs a year. 
Ramaphosa has also unveiled a ""stimulus and recovery plan"", focused on job creation and infrastructure development. 
BLEAK BUDGET
The scale of the challenge facing the president was underlined by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's bleak medium-term budget speech on Wednesday, when he unveiled weak growth forecasts and deficit estimates.
Compounding the challenge, Moody's said in a research note that the weaker fiscal outlook outlined by Mboweni was a negative factor in South Africa's credit outlook.
Moody's is the last of the top three agencies to keep an investment grade rating on South Africa. The agency is expected to issue a report on that soon.
The rand  turned weaker after Moody's report was released, but recovered later when Ramaphosa announced the pledges made at the conference.
""I'm willing to argue my case with them and say 'look at us anew... we are turning this ship around'. Admittedly we will not turn immediately but it is on the way to turning,"" Ramaphosa told Bloomberg television, referring to the ratings agencies.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 12:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus to name outsider after board hastened CFO's exit - sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is close to naming an outsider to replace finance chief Harald Wilhelm after board moves to overhaul top management in response to a corruption probe hastened his surprise resignation in May, people close to the matter said.
British and French authorities are investigating the use of middlemen in jetliner sales and the European planemaker says it is also supplying information to U.S. authorities.
Wilhelm, 52, who is not due to leave Airbus until next year, has not been accused of wrongdoing, two people familiar with the investigation said. 
Indeed, he initiated the planemaker's decision in 2014 to rip up a decades-old system of middlemen supporting jet sales, opening the door to British and French investigators. 
    Wilhelm's departure is the most striking evidence yet of a board-driven clearout designed to help Airbus win more lenient judicial settlements by presenting a completely fresh face to anti-fraud agencies, four people familiar with the matter said.
Airbus declined to comment on management changes, while Wilhelm also declined to comment. Airbus has said it reported its own concerns over the past use of intermediaries to British authorities in 2016 and that it is co-operating with all pending investigations.
Although Airbus abolished a system of political balance between its host states among its top management some years ago, the board will nominate a new German finance chief from outside the group in coming weeks, reflecting a desire to still balance French and German executives, two of the people added.
Wilhelm said in May he would leave Airbus in 2019, dashing plans for a staggered succession after CEO Tom Enders steps down in April. Airbus said at the time he had decided to leave ""in agreement with the board of directors"", without giving a reason.
It also praised the record of Wilhelm, who has spent 18 years in finance roles at Airbus. He had been expected to stay longer and had sought confirmation from the board over his future, two people familiar with the matter said. 
However, only days before the announcement Wilhelm learned that the board wanted him to leave at the same time as Enders, so that Airbus could mark a clean break, they added.
""The board panicked. They handled this very badly,"" a person familiar with the discussions said. Asked about such criticism, a spokesman said neither Airbus nor its board had any comment.
As CFO from 2012, Wilhelm automatically became co-chairman of a panel that ultimately approved payments to agents, five sources said. The German CFO increasingly asked questions about the longstanding system of payments and after a series of audits, he halted them altogether in 2014.
Although he had no role in the handling or recruitment of agents or ""business partners"", Wilhem's position on the obscure ""Company Development and Selection Committee"" left him vulnerable to broader pressure for a clearout of managers from an increasingly skittish board, the sources said. 
INVESTIGATION FALLOUT
The upheaval of the investigations into Airbus has barely disturbed a record run in its share price to around 100 euros, but Wilhelm's exit dismayed some investors, who made their concerns known at the top of the company.
The previously unreported circumstances surrounding Wilhelm's departure highlight the unpredictable and continuing fallout from the compliance probe, which has coincided with a string of management departures since it began in 2016.
The board's decision over Wilhelm mirrored growing signals that only a complete makeover would allow Airbus to win settlements surrounding the Anglo-French investigation.
In a 2017 landmark ruling that is still being digested, a British judge offered engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) a settlement involving a fine rather than criminal charges for allegedly paying bribes, saying it was a ""dramatically changed organisation"" with a new board and new executive team.
Under Britain's fledgling U.S.-style system of deferred prosecution agreements, the ruling demonstrated that firms may avoid prosecution and get discounted fines if they thoroughly overhaul leadership teams and show ""extraordinary cooperation"".
Several sources say Wilhelm's shock departure sowed internal fears of a broader ""witch hunt"" in the hopes of winning such a deal, with staff at every level being interviewed by lawyers.
Enders, who himself faces investigation over an Austrian fighter deal but denies wrongdoing, rejects any witch hunt is taking place at Airbus, which has new compliance rules, and has said its ability to compete depends on a change of culture. 
Even so, some executives have voiced concerns that distractions over probes and industrial snags are nibbling away at Airbus's standing with airlines as its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) wins more orders.
""This whole environment is also very visible to our customers who are very vocal about their own frustrations,"" then sales boss Eric Schulz said in a June memo seen by Reuters.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>",Sears directors tap Evercore to examine former CEO Lampert's deals -sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Two Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) board directors have hired investment bank Evercore Inc (N:EVR) to scrutinize deals that were led by former Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert with the U.S. retailer before it filed for bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The deals, including separations of Sears' businesses and real estate, may come under examination in bankruptcy proceedings, with creditors claiming the transactions stripped the retailer of valuable assets. Billionaire Lampert is the largest shareholder and creditor of Sears through his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc. 
""ESL supported the board's decision to authorize the review,"" a spokesman for Lampert's hedge fund said. ""These types of analyses are customary and ESL is confident that the subcommittee will confirm that the transactions involving ESL were on fair and reasonable terms and approved under appropriate corporate governance procedures,"" 
Sears, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15, and Evercore declined to comment. [nL2N1WV03N]
Sears directors Alan Carr and Bill Transier, who joined the retailer's board earlier in October, would work with Evercore to examine the deals and decide whether there are grounds for any legal action against Lampert, according to bankruptcy-court papers filed last week and the sources who asked not to be identified because Evercore's role is not yet official. 
In addition to the directors, Lampert will also likely face probing from Sears' unsecured creditors' committee, a group selected by a government bankruptcy watchdog in most cases, the sources said. The committee includes Sears' landlords, the U.S. government agency overseeing its remaining pensioners, vendors and representatives for bondholders.
Lampert arranged Sears' merger with discount chain Kmart in 2005. Since then, he has led numerous deals involving the retailer, including separating roughly $2.7 billion of its real estate into  Seritage Growth Properties  (N:SRG). 
In recent years, ESL has extended rescue loans to Sears as it lost billions of dollars and fell behind in the competition with discount retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). Lampert is now owed about $2.6 billion by Sears and owns close to half the company.
Evercore's hiring remains subject to court approval. The committee has also hired law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to help review the deals, according to court filings.
Sears is also trying to secure financing in bankruptcy in an effort to avert liquidation. The retailer delayed a hearing on a loan Lampert was in talks to lead, and did not provide a new date, according to court documents. 
LONG HISTORY OF DEALS WITH SEARS
Andrew Dietderich, an attorney representing Sears creditor Fairholme Capital Management LLC, said the company's many deals over the years resulted in a slow-motion bankruptcy.
""These cases are the last mile in a multi-year liquidation, one that happened without court supervision,"" Dietderich said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York last week. Bruce Berkowitz, Fairholme's founder, stepped down from Sears' board in 2017. 
Creditors can claim that transactions put together before a bankruptcy deprived them of value and preempted court proceedings that are meant to determine their repayment. 
""All of the transactions that took place here, your honor, took place with the strictest of corporate governance oversight,"" ESL attorney James Bromley said at last week's bankruptcy-court hearing, adding that Fairholme representatives served on the Sears board and signed off on multiple transactions.
Lampert is now proposing to buy financially healthier Sears stores in a bankruptcy auction, after making offers to buy the company's real estate, appliance brand Kenmore and home services business outside of court earlier this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Friday it wants the Trump administration to back a nationwide program to boost sales of zero emission vehicles like electric cars, even as the government has proposed ending California's ability to require more clean vehicles.
GM says a nationwide program modeled on California's effort could result in 7 million electric vehicles, or EVs, on U.S. roads by 2030. The largest U.S. automaker said the requirements would not apply if ""battery cost or infrastructure targets are not practicable within the time frame.""
GM product chief Mark Reuss told reporters that governments and industries in Asia and Europe ""are working together to enact policies now to hasten the shift to an all-electric future. It's very simple: America has the opportunity to lead in the technologies of the future.""
A national mandate also would create jobs and reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and ""make EVs more affordable,"" Reuss added. GM also wants the program to offer incentives for electric autonomous and ride-sharing vehicles.
GM has said it plans to offer 20 EVs globally by 2023.
The Trump administration in August proposed reversing Obama administration fuel rules and freezing standards at 2020 model year levels through 2026.
The administration has proposed barring California from setting its own emissions requirements or requiring more zero emission vehicles. The administration is also considering eliminating all emissions compliance credits that automakers receive for building EVs.
Other automakers, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, did not comment on GM's proposal. The Trump administration and California officials did not immediately comment but one environmental group called the GM proposal ""a distraction.""
Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles and fuels at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said automakers should focus on maintaining the Obama era rules that call for hiking fuel efficiency requirements at about 5 percent annually through 2026.
Automakers and others have until Friday to file comments on the administration's proposed emissions revisions. Major automakers say they do not support freezing requirements.
California wants 15.4 percent of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles. Nine other states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, have adopted those requirements. In January, California Governor Jerry Brown set a target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030. 
A nationwide ZEV plan would give automakers more flexibility to meet a single nationwide target, rather than specific state sales requirements, GM said.
California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols said last month the state will ""continue to insist on cars that produce fewer emissions, including millions more zero-emission vehicles.""

The Trump administration criticizes California's ZEV mandate, saying it requires automakers to spend tens of billions of dollars developing vehicles that most consumers do not want, only to sell them at a loss.

(Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) dropped by the most in four years on Friday after its outlook for holiday season sales missed targets, fanning concerns that Wall Street's tech darlings are finally starting to face stronger competition.
The third quarter results were the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos' firm had fallen short of sales targets and, allied to a similar disappointment from Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL), they sent a shockwave reverberating through stock markets.
There were no ratings downgrades from the Wall Street analysts who have almost universally backed the companies' long-term prospects, but several said there were signs that both were beginning to face tougher competition from tech peers as well as the retail companies Amazon has bullied in recent years. 
The 9-percent fall in shares knocked more than $80 billion off Amazon's market value and relegated it behind  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in terms of market value.
Now the Seattle-based firm has devoured retail players like Borders, Sears and Toys 'R' Us, it was facing bigger challenges from multinationals who are investing hard to compete, D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte said. 
""Google, Microsoft, and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) ... are more difficult to kill,"" he said. 
Shares in Alphabet fell about 6 percent, knocking about $45 billion off its market value after it fell short on sales after beating estimates for the past eight quarters. 
Revenue from Amazon's international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, was at the heart of the shortfall in results, growth halving to 13.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.
""We don't see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad, and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Ross Sandler said.
Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, to as much as $72.5 billion, while analysts had expected a maximum figure of $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates. 
Several analysts called the company's outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely.
""Overall, Amazon's growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.

Shares of the company were down 9.0 percent at $1,622 in morning trade.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Long-term care policies loom over U.S. life insurance results,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Big U.S. life insurers are bracing for elevated payouts to owners of long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirmed and elderly customers.
Insurers that have long-term care businesses likely set aside more funds for claims on older policies during the third quarter, analysts said.
 Unum Group  (N:UNM) said on Wednesday that it had boosted long-term care reserves by $593 million, after taxes, partly reflecting its expectation that claims would remain elevated going forward. MetLife Inc (N:MET) and Genworth Financial Inc (N:GNW) are among those scheduled to report next week. Canada's  Manulife Financial  Corp (TO:MFC) is due to report on Nov. 7.
The pattern will continue for long-term care insurers through 2019, with many boosting reserves by at least ten percent, Fitch Ratings said in a recent report.
Some insurers have been reviewing assumptions they made when writing policies many years ago, when life expectancies were shorter and health care expenses were lower. Premiums they initially set have not been enough to cover claims from customers who live well into their 80s or 90s and require increasingly expensive care in nursing homes or their own homes.
""The good news is that we're living longer and the bad news is that we're living longer,"" said Michael Frank, an actuary and president of Aquarius Capital, a consultancy in Port Chester, New York. ""Long-term care insurers are dealing with multiple crises.""
In August,  Prudential  Financial Inc (N:PRU) said it was boosting long-term care reserves by $1.5 billion, a move that analysts said could be a harbinger for others.
At issue was an assumption about so-called ""morbidity improvement,"" a term that actuaries use to describe people becoming healthier and needing less long-term care in the future.
Some state regulators allow insurers to predict brighter outcomes, thereby lessening reserves, but others, including New York, forbid that assumption, industry and regulatory sources told Reuters.
""This is a hot-button item in the world of long-term care insurance,"" said Fred Andersen, who leads a National Association of Insurance Commissioners group examining morbidity improvement assumptions, along with other factors that affect reserves and premiums.
Prudential (LON:PRU) stopped selling long-term care insurance in 2012, but still faces substantial costs from old policies. The insurer no longer considers morbidity improvement when calculating long-term care reserves, Chief Financial Officer Robert Falzon told analysts in August.

Prudential's decision may cause other insurers to consider dropping the assumption too, said Moody's Senior Credit Officer Laura Bazer.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Britain's SFO denied permission to reinstate charges against Barclays,"By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - A judge on Friday denied the Serious Fraud Office's application to reinstate charges against  Barclays  (L:BARC) over its 2008 capital raising, potentially ending the biggest remaining legal headache facing the bank over its conduct during the financial crisis.
A British court in May had dismissed the charges against the bank, a decision the SFO said at the time it would seek to reverse by applying to the High Court to reinstate them. 
Barclays denies the SFO's allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped Barclays avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis.
Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as “financial assistance”.
The SFO had been pursuing charges that Barclays unlawfully received such assistance, and that it had conspired with former senior executives to commit fraud over two so-called ""advisory services agreements"" between Qatar and the bank.
The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions represents a major setback for the SFO, which has faced criticism from British politicians over the past few years.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain looks likely to trim the amount of government bonds it plans to issue this financial year thanks to better-than-expected public borrowing figures, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers ahead of Monday's budget.
With only five months to go until Brexit and no agreement yet between London and Brussels, most analysts think finance minister Philip Hammond will take a cautious approach to his budget plans.
Still, stronger-than-expected tax receipts in the current financial year, 2018/19, have provided some leeway with the public finances, should he choose to use it. 
(Graphic: UK likely to lower borrowing forecast for 2018/19 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ORQcu6)
The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to cut on Monday its forecast for Britain's 2018/19 budget deficit to around 31.7 billion pounds ($40.53 billion) from 37.1 billion pounds, according to the median forecast in Friday's poll of primary dealers.
Primary dealers are banks that buy gilts directly from the government to sell them on, helping to create a liquid market.
The smaller profile for borrowing this year means the Debt Management Office (DMO) could in turn trim its planned issuance of gilts for 2018/19 to 101 billion pounds from the 106 billion pounds it forecast in April, the Reuters poll showed.
That would be the smallest volume of gilts issued since 2007/08, before the global financial crisis tipped Britain into recession. 
The fall, however, may prove to be a low watermark ahead of some difficult years. 
""Stronger-than-forecast public finances should lead to the DMO being 8 billion pounds ahead of their remit this year, but issuance is likely to pick up thereafter,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note to clients.
The aging of the population will pressure public finances in the years ahead even before considering Brexit's impact on economic growth, according to the OBR.
A couple of forecasters said the DMO may leave its gilt issuance remit for this year unchanged, building up some over-funding ahead of a trickier 2019/20.
The forecasts pointed to a substantial increase in gilt issuance in the financial year starting next April -- after Brexit is due to occur -- to above 131 billion pounds.
That partly reflects Prime Minister Theresa May's promise of higher health spending, which will add 20 billion pounds to the National Health Service budget by 2023/24.
Most analysts said they did not expect Monday's budget to ruffle fixed income investors too much. 
""This budget is unlikely to be a market mover unless, perhaps, it becomes part of Brexit-related political gamesmanship,"" Citi rates strategist Jamie Searle said.
Gilt yields have been driven lower lately, mostly by Brexit worries but also by ructions in the euro zone, where Italy is attempting to pass a budget that flouts the European Union's fiscal rules.
On Friday, the 10-year benchmark gilt yield (GB10YT=RR) struck its lowest since Sept. 4 at 1.409 percent.
Thirteen of 15 primary dealers polled by Reuters provided forecasts for government borrowing, and 12 gave forecasts for gilt issuance.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",EU shows no sign of heeding U.S. threat over derivatives clearing,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is proposing to give the European Central Bank sweeping powers over foreign clearing houses in times of market stress, an EU document showed, as the bloc shows little sign of heeding U.S. calls to water down the plans.
The bloc has proposed changing the ECB's statute to give it a broad role in the oversight of EU and foreign clearing houses that handle large amounts of euro-denominated securities. That would include those in London, which will lie outside the EU in five months' time.
Now the current EU president Austria has proposed fleshing out the role with detailed powers, such as being able to force foreign clearing houses to ""submit information, cooperate in the assessment of their resilience to adverse market conditions, and open overnight deposit accounts"", the document said.
The EU wants the changes approved in time for Britain's departure from the bloc next March. LCH, a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), dominates clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps and will be outside the EU.
In exceptional situations, the ECB could force a foreign clearing house to comply with temporary requirements on how much margin customers should post to back trades, the level of collateral, and how frequent intraday margins should be collected, tasks normally supervised by the home regulator.
Financial lawyers say this would, for example, give the ECB power to stop a foreign clearing house raising margins on euro-denominated positions in times of market stress.
The ECB has long been concerned that so much euro-denominated trade is already conducted outside the euro zone in London, and appears keen to bring this under its supervision after Brexit.
Some policymakers had wanted to stop a clearing house from increasing margins during the euro zone debt crisis, saying this amplified stress in markets.
The United States is unhappy about the EU plans. 
Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission which regulates the American derivatives market, has threatened retaliation against EU financial firms if the bloc does not water down what he sees as overly intrusive proposals affecting U.S. clearers such as CME and ICE. [nL8N1WX2II]
The European Commission has dismissed this as ""blackmail"" and a working group of EU member state representatives could give the proposals the green light next Tuesday. [nL8N1WY6ZL]

Member states would then thrash out a final text with the European Parliament, which has already backed similar proposals.

1287,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Trump Is Now Bad for the Stock Market,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Trump bump is turning into a significant Trump discount.
That’s been more than evident of late. The S&P 500 Index fell for the first three days of the week, culminating in a 3 percent plunge Wednesday as worries over China’s economy and President Donald Trump’s trade-war maneuvers morphed into a general sense of gloom about the global economic outlook. On Thursday stocks rebounded, but the rockiness has added to a growing sense that the market’s foundation is less than stable, and that Trump’s trade steps are what is testing the cracks. 
All told, the S&P 500 Index is now 6.5 percent cheaper than it was before Trump was elected president, with the gauge trading at 15.7 times next year’s expected earnings, down from just under 17 in early November 2016. From inauguration day, stock-market valuations are down a little more than 9 percent. By comparison, they rose 16 percent in Barack Obama’s first two years in office.
Many had long argued that the market looked overvalued, even before Trump was elected. And in the months after the election, stocks did zoom to new highs. But in terms of valuation, the market has given back all of that and then some. The reason is in part due to higher interest rates and inflation, both of which, again, were expected to happen long before Donald Trump. Corporate operating margins, likely a big factor in higher stock-market valuations, are still near their peak, but with a tight labor market many expect that to turn as well.
Nonetheless, at least part of the sell-off in stocks does seem to be Trump-related. Stock-market valuations peaked in mid-December last year, just days before the Republicans’ tax cut was signed, at 19 times the next four quarters of reported earnings. Worries about a trade war have been a big part of that drop. The biggest portion of the drop-off in stock market valuations happened in late January and early February, when President Trump made clear that he was going to go ahead with tariffs and other measures to block trade with China and others.
While trade fears are still an issue, worries have shifted recently from trade to growth. There, increasingly, the Trump tax cut seems to be coming up short as well. The reduction in the corporate rate has certainly boosted companies’ earnings this year. The bottom lines of corporations in the S&P 500 are expected to rise 24 percent this year. But much of that seems to be a one-time boost, and not the sustained higher growth that Trump and his advisers promised from low tax rates. Analysts are now expecting 2019 earnings growth to slow to 10.1 percent, virtually the same growth they were predicting back in June 2017, six months before the passage of the tax cut. What’s more, capital expenditure growth appears to have significantly slowed in the third quarter, though it is still up from a year ago, according to report out Thursday morning from strategists at UBS.
To be sure, earnings and the stock market are up from where they were when Trump was elected, and the president can claim some portion of the credit for that. But a Trump bump? That’s long gone. "

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Snap shares sink as two million users move on,"(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) shares plunged 14 percent on Friday after the Snapchat-owner posted its second straight quarter of user losses and forecast further declines, a boost for  Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) Instagram ahead of its results next week.
At least four Wall Street analysts cut their price target as Snap's much-criticized app redesign continued to weigh on daily active user numbers (DAU), particularly in Europe and the U.S.
A revelation for teenage users and twenty-somethings worldwide when its vanishing-post model was first launched in 2011, Snap's user growth has stalled in the past two years as Instagram mimicked its best features.
Its 186 million users in the third quarter compares to the Facebook-owned app's more than 1 billion.
JP Morgan and RBC Capital Markets cut their targets for Snap stock by half.
""We believe that Instagram is much more penetrated in these demographics, and it will be challenging for Snap to pull users away from Instagram,"" JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note.
Shares of the company were down 12.2 percent at $6.14 in trading before the bell.
A redesign at the start of this year aimed at rebooting the app spurred a backlash led by celebrity users including Kylie Jenner, who threatened to boycott the photo-messaging app.
""Some users may be leaving the platform because it has lost its novelty, which would prove to be a bigger long-term concern,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said.
Snap's DAUs have now declined by five million since the first quarter, which the company blamed mainly on the Android app rollout.
With the company anticipating further declines, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill fears these losses could spill over to 2019.
Snap shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year, while Facebook's, hurt by the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, have lost about 14 percent.
Of the 36 analysts covering the stock, 16 now rate it ""hold"" and 13 rate it ""sell"" or lower. The median price target on the stock is $10, down 15 percent from a month ago.
Analysts have said the number of advertisers active on Snapchat, though small, have been steadily growing. However, the social media app is still at the mercy of its user count.
""While monetization trends in Q3 are promising, we don't think the stock can recover until the user base is growing solidly again,"" Canaccord Genuity's Michael Graham said.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce shares tumble after report of Airbus engine delays,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Rolls-Royce (L:RR) fell as much as 13 percent to their lowest since April 2017 and were on track for their biggest one-day fall in three years on Friday after a Bloomberg report said there were delays to its engine production for Airbus (PA:AIR).
The report said Rolls-Royce is running into production hurdles on the engine for the new Airbus A330neo jet as the European planemaker rushes to meet delivery targets this year.
In France, Airbus shares sank 5 percent, set for their worst day since June 2016.
Airbus declined to comment and Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The reported setback compounds weak sales and engine reliability problems in testing for the latest model of Airbus's most used wide-body jet, which has historically been a second key source of cash for Airbus behind its best-selling A320.
A source close to the company confirmed that ""there is a problem"" with Rolls-Royce's Trent 7000 engine that exclusively powers the A330neo, echoing problems on a similar model that is available on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787, causing some planes to be grounded.
Market sources say the A330neo, a refresh of the A330 launched with fuel-saving engines in 2014 at a time when oil was above $100 a barrel, has struggled to make its mark because of lower oil prices and the popularity of the underlying model.
Additionally, Boeing has been targeting potential customers with its newer Boeing 787, powered by alternative engines from Rolls-Royce rival  General Electric  (N:GE).
Airbus and Rolls-Royce say the A330neo could benefit from a trend towards low-cost, long-haul operations, the economics of which are looking more attractive as oil prices return to $80.

But there are continued doubts about a major order from AirAsia (KL:AIRA), which is now looking at smaller A321neo aircraft to replace part of its deal for 100 A330neo jets.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Norway wealth fund calls for expertise on company boards,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will ask the 9,000 companies in which it invests to ensure their board members have sufficient expertise, time and independence, it said in a series of policy papers on Friday.
The $970 billion fund, which funnels Norway's revenues from oil and gas production, owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares. It has in recent years become a more active shareholder as it has grown in heft. 
While some of the demands put forward on Friday are not new for the fund -- such as opposing CEOs who sit as chairs of their companies -- others are, such as requiring industry expertise from directors.
A majority of independent board members should have ""fundamental industry insight"" and at least two of the independent members should have worked in the company's industry, said the fund. 
""It is really ... industry expertise which is an issue that has been under-communicated from investors,"" fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters. ""The strong desire to have a profitable company by having a board who knows the business.""
He declined to name specific sectors where he thought board industry expertise was lacking, but said, ""There has been a focus on the financial sector, also from regulators, which we will reinforce from our point of view. 
""But this is a broader issue than just the financial sector,"" he added. ""We have seen quite differing practice in different sectors and different countries. 
""This is a signal that ... we will try to look at these issues more quantitatively, to see where we can find the major issues with regards to countries and sectors.""
The position papers will form the basis of the fund's position for how it votes on the boards of companies.
""It will be a starting point for how we will vote,"" Chief Corporate Governance Officer Carine Smith Ihenacho told reporters earlier.
Asked whether the fund would divest from reluctant companies, on these issues, she said: ""It will be a basis for voting, dialogue and engagement.""
Directors should also ensure they have enough time to fulfill their obligations to the boards on which they serve, said the fund. 
In practice, that means board members of listed companies should not serve on more than five boards at one time and the chair of a leading company should generally not chair the board of another company, it said. 
In the third quarter, the fund made a return of 2.1 percent, helped by rising North American stocks. It still returned 0.2 percentage points less than the a benchmark index set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry. 
""The market development was affected by expectations of differing economic growth and uncertainty about the effects of increased trade barriers,"" Slyngstad said.

LONDON (Reuters) - With 63 percent of MSCI's global index now in a ""bear"" market, world stocks look oversold but global equity funds nevertheless attracted inflows of $8.5 billion over the past week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday.
World stocks are heading for their fifth straight week of losses and look set for their worst month in around seven years. The U.S. S&P500 is a whisker off losing all its gains for the year amid fears that slowing world growth and trade conflicts will erode company profits.
BAML data - based on analysis of numbers from Boston-based flows tracker EPFR Global covering the week to Wednesday - showed that after weeks of equity selling, 1,742 of 2,767 global stocks had fallen 20 percent off peaks, putting them into a so-called bear market.
In emerging markets, the figure was as high as 919 out of 1,150 stocks - 80 percent of the total - while of 1,899 New York stocks, 1,164 or 61 percent, were in the ""bear"" bracket.
But emerging equity funds took in $2.6 billion, the highest inflow in seven months, while Japanese funds received $5.3 billion.
U.S. shares too absorbed $1.8 billion but Europe has posted outflows in 32 of the past 33 weeks. 
BAML said despite big market falls recently and signs of investor buying interest, it was too soon ""to flip from bearish to bullish"". 
""Big picture explanation - it's late-cycle and Fed is tightening. Cyclical explanation - peak positioning, peak profits, peak policy stimulus = peak prices in 2018,"" the bank's analysts added.
But noting that 70 percent of world stocks had been in bear territory in 2011, they said if the selloff turned out not to be a harbinger of recession, it could signal an excellent entry point in the coming weeks or months.
But pain continued to be felt on bond markets with a fifth week of outflow, losing $7.2 billion. Investment-grade as well as junk debt lost money, shedding $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion respectively, while emerging bonds saw $1.1 billion outflows.

BAML noted that the annualised near-10 percent loss on U.S. Treasuries and 4 percent on investment grade bonds would be the third-largest since 1970.

Instead, profit reports and forecasts following the most recent three months are giving investors indigestion as companies send unclear messages about the rising cost of goods and labor.
""I don't understand why people are so hesitant to admit that we're in an upturn in inflation,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC.
Companies, he said, are ""scared that they're not going to get rewarded for pricing growth.""
The unexplained absence of inflation during the last decade's U.S. equity price boom is now being replaced in investor psychology by fears that inflation is finally pushing up costs and squeezing margins and may be one of the culprits in this month's selloff of U.S. stocks.
U.S. consumer price inflation was 2.3 percent in the year to September, according to the Labor Department, and even ""core"" inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is running at 2.2 percent for the year, above the Federal Reserve's target. 
With unemployment at 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly 40 years, annual wage growth was 2.9 percent in September, a nine-year high.
The question is whether the cost increases companies say they are now absorbing are fleeting or here to stay.
At stake is a market rally built on the premise that stock valuations are justified by earnings that go on growing.
While earnings growth is still high at 22 percent so far this quarter, the amount by which S&P 500 (SPX) index companies are beating analyst estimates is nearly half of what it was during the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Unless companies can raise prices fast enough to keep up with the rising costs of hiring and materials, stocks may struggle to maintain current valuations. 
Borrowing costs are also rising as the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates into 2019 to ward off the inflationary threat, with U.S. economy growing at 4.2 percent in the second quarter this year, helped by last year's $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts.
And now U.S. businesses are also warning of input costs rising as a result of President Trump's imposition of import tariffs. Steel and aluminum tariffs have cost  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) about $1 billion in profits, its chief executive officer said last month. 
""Market participants are really concerned that maybe finally we have seen peak earnings and that people are talking much more about costs rising and, looking ahead, corporate profit margins could certainly come under pressure,"" said Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist at 3EDGE Asset Management LP.
Corporate leaders sit on the frontline of inflation, but they are not offering consistent guidance about where they expect the trend to go from here. The divergence in guidance and outlooks is costing investors money.
On October 8, paint-maker PPG Industries Inc (N:PPG) told investors to expect lower profits, saying that it expected the prices for the raw materials it uses to keep rising, and its stock fell 10 percent during the following trading session. Economist Ed Yardeni said the forecast help set the stage for the broader market selloff later that week.
Yet PPG's rival,  Akzo Nobel  NV (AS:AKZO), said nine days later that it thinks inflation on those sorts of items has peaked for the year. Akzo shares rallied 3.0 percent.
""There's anecdotes about inflation pressures, but when you add them up we're not seeing it in the macro indicators,"" said Yardeni.
The Fed's own ""Beige Book"" collection of anecdotal evidence on business conditions, published on Wednesday, said inflation has appeared modest or moderate in most parts of the country.
Investors are rewarding companies that can keep up with inflation and punishing those that cannot. 
So far this year, companies with high operating leverage, typically meaning they can generate additional profits with relatively small increases in their costs, have returned 13 percent, including dividends, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) data. 
By comparison the S&P 500 has returned about 0.9 percent.
And anecdotes about costs abound. 
At Del Taco Restaurants Inc (O:TACO), executives warned on an earnings call earlier this month that food inflation will increase in 2019 and its labor costs will grow too, given an increase in California's minimum wage, despite efforts to minimize labor by using food processing machines to cut more cheese and tomatoes. The company hopes to offset those at least some of those increases by raising prices. Del Taco shares fell to a more than 2-year low.
But inflation has helped other companies. 
Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc), two of the world's biggest consumer goods makers, both reported a pick-up in sales last week as inflation helped give them greater scope to push through price hikes. Both companies' shares rose on the news.
While inflation has risen and is a concern, markets generally see it contained. One bond-based measure of consumer inflation expected over the five years starting in 2023, puts the figure at 2.2 percent, little changed from today.
But some equity investors are not waiting for a clearer signal. Bernstein, for one, said he is investing with an emphasis on sectors, primarily in cyclical consumer industries, that can pass on costs to their customers.

""You need companies that have pricing power,"" he said.

Fit cars for export to the United States are now made at Honda's auto plant in Celaya, Mexico. The Celaya plant also makes HR-V sport utility vehicles (SUVs) for the U.S. market. A Honda spokesman said the company had not made any decisions on Fit production.
The new trilateral deal, which replaces the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is set to raise the minimum North American content for cars to qualify for duty-free market access to 75 percent from 62.5 percent. 
U.S. President Donald Trump wants the deal to shrink the U.S. trade deficit by curbing imports into the United States and boosting production of foreign-branded vehicles there. 
But the terms of the trade deal reduce Honda's incentive to produce the Fit in Mexico for the U.S. and European markets, said the sources, one of whom has direct knowledge of the plan and the other who was briefed on it.
They declined to be identified as the matter was still confidential. 
In addition, they said, U.S. consumers are increasingly shifting to SUVs, making it more advantageous for the Mexico plant to build those, rather than subcompacts.

One of the sources said that if Honda decides to shift production, it would come when the company launches its next Fit model in the next few years.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Steel capacity set to expand just as demand growth ebbs,"By Maytaal Angel and Yuka Obayashi
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Spurred by a steel-price rally, firms are pouring money into new plants that are set to start producing just as growth in demand for the construction material shrinks, industry executives say, challenging the market's prevailing bull narrative.
Steel prices are up 70 percent since hitting decade lows in late 2015, driven by a cyclical upturn, rising protectionism and nearly 150 million tonnes of capacity cuts in China, producer of half the world's 1.6 billion tonnes of steel. 
Shares in global steelmakers have soared since late 2015, when excess steelmaking capacity sparked a sectoral crisis that resulted in shutdowns, bankruptcies and job cuts. ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest, is up 135 percent in that period.
""With the economic upturn over the last two to three years, the issue (of overcapacity) had nearly disappeared,"" Voestalpine Chief Executive Wolfgang Eder told Reuters at a conference in Tokyo. 
""But today it has come back because it seems we are close to or have already seen the peak of the upturn."" 
Industry association worldsteel expects demand for steel, a $900 billion industry seen as a gauge of economic health, will grow by 3.9 percent this year and 1.4 percent next year.
It does not forecast figures for 2020, but many see demand growth ebbing further that year.
On the supply side, steelmaking capacity could, between this year and 2020, rise by 52-91 million tonnes, or 2.3-4 percent, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. This equates to growth of around 1 percent a year.
""On the surface, (the forecasts point to) demand growth outstripping capacity growth. However, the majority of growth is expected to come in 2018, so there is the fear of what will happen when demand slows,"" said Jeremy Platt at consultants MEPS.
Steelmaking capacity fell for a second year last year to 2.25 billion tonnes, according to the OECD, narrowing the gap between capacity and production to 561 million tonnes from 730 million a year earlier.
(Graphic: Global steelmaking capacity, production - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Re6mel)
Steel consumers in Europe's auto industry say supply is tight. Delivery times, normally around 12 weeks, are at 20 weeks presently as steelmakers struggle to meet orders, according to industry association ACEA.
However on a global level, a gap between steel capacity and production above 450 million tonnes is considered excessive, suggesting plants have more than 20 percent of capacity idle. 
""The problem of the gap between demand and supply has been only half-solved,"" Koji Kakigi, chief executive of Japan’s second-largest steelmaker JFE Steel, said at the Tokyo conference.
Kakigi and Kosei Shindo, president of Japan’s biggest steelmaker Nippon Steel, also called for the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity to continue after its first term ends next year.
The forum was set up by the G20 group of countries in 2016 to tackle overcapacity, as well as the state subsidies that cause it and lead to trade tensions. The United States has been critical of the forum's effectiveness.
Earlier this year, Washington took unilateral action, slapping 25 percent tariffs on steel imports. The tariffs sparked retaliation, eventually escalating into a global trade war that could crimp economic growth.

""While we do not yet foresee a decline in global steel demand, there is clearly a risk that capacity expansions announced today may only come online when the global macro picture is quite different,"" Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said.

1304,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Marijuana Shortages Abound in Canada Amid Licensing Rigmarole,"(Bloomberg) -- The Canadian cannabis industry is still reeling from sky-high demand in the second week of legalization, with growers expressing frustration at the length of time it’s taking to get licensed as shelves sit empty.
“We’re biting our nails and I think our shareholders are biting their nails too,” said Anthony Durkacz, director at FSD Pharma Inc., an Ontario-based producer that received its cultivation license a year ago and is still waiting for its sales license. “We want to be supplying.”
The process of getting a sales license from Health Canada is onerous, according to Durkacz. After receiving a cultivation license, a grower must produce two full crops, send them off for testing, get its sales software audited, and then submit a completed application for the sales license, which can take up to 341 days to process, he said.
“So even after you’ve done everything and done everything right you could be waiting up to a year to get the license,” he said.
Canada became the first major economy to legalize recreational cannabis on Oct. 17, taking the lead in a global market that’s expected to reach $32 billion in consumer spending by 2022, according to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. The euphoria that sent pot stocks soaring in the lead-up to legalization has faded, with the BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers index losing 26 percent over seven sessions before rebounding on Thursday.
While some growers wait for their licenses, others are struggling to keep up with demand. The government-run Ontario Cannabis Store received 100,000 orders in its first 24 hours. In Quebec, online and in-store orders totaled nearly 140,000 in the first week of legalization, and the provincial-owned retailer indicated Wednesday it may have to close some locations as producers couldn’t meet demand. Producers will have a “colossal” amount of work to do to ensure supply, the Societe Quebecoise du Cannabis said in a statement.
The problem is that no one knew what the demand curve would look like after a century of prohibition, said Bruce Linton, chief executive officer of  Canopy Growth  Corp. (NYSE:CGC), which has secured more than a third of total Canadian supply committed to date.
Canopy shipped approximately 1 million orders of medical cannabis in its first four years of operations. It expects to ship more than 1 million units of recreational pot in the first four weeks after legalization, Linton said.
‘Just Outstanding’
“The response has been pretty unbelievable,” Linton said. “I don’t think everything will run out but you might not be able to get the identical stuff you got last time.”
He added that Canopy is sending out orders as fast as it can pack and ship them, but there have been delays in getting new product up on the provincial websites. It will start shipping out new products, including Tweed-brand gel caps and pre-rolled joints, over the next week and a half.
Initial demand at Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis was “just outstanding,” said Chara Goodings, a spokeswoman for the government regulator that’s overseeing sales in the western province. “But it has created some struggles with our supply level.” Very few producers have been able to deliver what was agreed upon, she said.
Dried Bud
The situation is similar in Manitoba, where Winnipeg-based Delta 9 Cannabis Inc (V:NINE) only has dried bud on its store shelves as it has been unable to get any shipments of cannabis oils or gel caps, said spokesman Gary Symons. In the first seven days, Delta 9 saw close to 9,600 transactions totaling C$736,124 ($562,830) in revenues. The company is now selling about C$50,000 worth of product a day.
“Every province, not just Manitoba, is receiving less cannabis than originally requested,” Susan Harrison, spokeswoman for Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries, said in an email.
Aphria Inc. CEO Vic Neufeld predicted the supply shortages on the company’s earnings call five days before legalization. Citing supply-chain issues, labor shortages and delays in getting licenses and excise stamps from the government, Neufeld said Aphria would be unable to meet demand in the first two to three months after legalization. The company was forced to destroy almost 14,000 plants worth C$979,000 in the last quarter due to a lack of qualified greenhouse workers.
Extra Staff
There are currently 132 licensed producers in Canada and “many more are in the queue,” said Canadian Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor. Health Canada has hired 300 additional staff to evaluate applications, she said. But the process, which includes background checks, is time-consuming and it’s important to not cut corners, she said.
“There’s not a mass shortage of cannabis around the country right now,” only certain strains that have sold out, Petitpas Taylor said. “We really have all hands on deck, we want to do what we can, but in no way am I going to compromise this new regime.”
The challenge for the government is balancing public safety with a desire to eradicate the illicit market, said Deepak Anand, vice president of business development and government relations at Cannabis Compliance Inc., a consulting firm for pot companies which is currently working on “hundreds” of licensing applications.
“Health Canada’s trying to balance quality and public safety with the need for getting more product on so that they can eliminate the black market,” Anand said. “Sometimes these goals conflict and compete with each other.”
The only near-term solution to the supply shortage, according to Durkacz at FSD Pharma (OTC:FSDDF), is to allow retailers to sell product sourced from the black market.
“You would instantaneously have a supply-demand balance and then you could try to convert people from the black market to the legalized market,” he said. “That’s probably the only way to solve this in the short term.”

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 05:44AM ET</span>",High as a kite? Danish cannabis firm StenoCare shares surge on debut,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish cannabis firm StenoCare  sparked a stock market stampede on Friday as investors rushed to buy into its shares on their debut, driven by enthusiasm for the therapeutic benefits of its products.
The stock nearly quadrupled in price to hit a high of 33.50 Danish crowns in early trade, valuing the company at more than 200 million crowns ($30 million). They had been priced at 8.80 crowns in their initial public offering. 
Interest from investors in the stock had been overwhelming, Chief Executive Thomas Skovlund Schnegelsberg said. ""From our communication with investors, we get a sense that many might have followed their heart rather than their wallet.
""We've had people contact us who themselves are users of medicinal cannabis and said they want to support the case,"" Schnegelsberg said.
Scientists say evidence is growing that cannabis can ease epilepsy and other conditions such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy-induced nausea, prompting renewed interest in a substance best known for its psychoactive properties.
Denmark is one of several European countries, including Germany, Britain, the Czech Republic and Italy, that have allowed prescriptions of medicinal cannabis oil. Denmark, which legalized the medicinal use of cannabis from Jan. 1, is also one of the few European nations to legalize local production.
Recreational use of cannabis is still prohibited in the country even though Copenhagen's Christiania district is famous for cannabis-selling booths which are rarely targeted by the authorities.
StenoCare plans to use money raised in the IPO to launch its own production to serve local customers and export to other European markets. It plans a first sowing of cannabis plants in the first quarter of 2019.
""Our ambition is to have our own products on the shelves next year, but the exact timing depends on approval from the Danish Medicines Agency,"" said Schnegelsberg.
StenoCare currently imports cannabis from Canada's CannTrust, with first deliveries to Danish pharmacies and hospitals made last month.
Cannabis is also attracting the interest of consumer product companies after Canada last week became only the second country in the world after Uruguay to fully legalize cannabis.

The move has prompted drinks firms such as Constellation Brands (N:STZ),  Molson Coors  (N:TAP) and  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) to look into cannabis-infused drinks.

The MSCI Asia index has been bruised by a sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest losing streak since 2015. It has fallen more than 4 percent this week.
Chinese shares were pulled lower and the yuan fell past 6.96 to the dollar, touching its weakest level against the dollar since December 2016.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Volkswagen has held kick-off meeting for 2019 Traton IPO: sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Alexander Hübner
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has held an initial meeting to discuss plans for the flotation of its trucks unit Traton, set to be Germany's biggest of 2019, after hiring a quartet of banks to manage the potential 6 billion euro ($6.8 billion) IPO, people close to the matter said.
Roughly 80 bankers, lawyers and representatives of Volkswagen and Traton came together last week for a kick-off meeting to discuss strategy in marketing shares of the maker of trucks under the MAN, Scania and VW brands to potential investors, the people added. 
JP Morgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Citi (N:C) have been mandated as global coordinators of the listing, while law firms Freshfields and Linklaters are also helping to prepare the deal, they added.
Volkswagen, the banks and lawyers declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. 
Europe's leading carmaker wants Traton to be in shape by year-end for a potential stock market listing, which is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2019.
VW has plans to build a global trucks business by integrating its MAN and Scania divisions to challenge rivals  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb).
A flotation could also allow Volkswagen Truck & Bus to build a war chest to completely buy out Navistar (N:NAV), a U.S. truck maker in which it already owns a 16.85 percent stake.
As precondition for the deal, Volkswagen on Thursday made corporate structure changes so two smaller units will not be part of the pure truck and bus company that will list. 
VW's legacy trucks unit MAN SE (DE:MANG) will sell a 76 percent stake in gear maker Renk (F:ZARG) and its wholly owned maker of large engines - MAN Energy Solutions - to a subsidiary of VW, MAN SE said in a statement.
An agreement between VW and MAN will expire at the end of the year so the Wolfsburg-based auto maker would profit from any revaluation if the deals close before then.
Minority MAN SE shareholders will be offered a guaranteed dividend of 5.50 euros per share. VW has also offered to buy out minority MAN SE shareholders by March for 90.29 euros a share, which would cost VW about 3 billion euros if all shares are tendered.
While Traton Chief Executive Andreas Renschler has said he is targeting proceeds of up to 6 billion euros from selling about 25 percent of the company's shares, Volkswagen may have to settle for a smaller number, people familiar with the IPO preparations said. 

Volkswagen does not want to sell out on the cheap and may opt for a smaller offer size, similar to  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) which opted to downsize its Healthineers IPO earlier this year on investor response to its views on valuation, they added.

Shares in French auto parts maker Valeo (PA:VLOF) sank more than 19 percent after its second profit warning in three months, flagging disruption from tougher European emissions tests and a sharp sales downturn in China.
Peer  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) also tumbled 9.2 percent after it announced an agreement to buy Japanese car navigation system maker Clarion from Hitachi.
Altran (PA:ALTT) shares surged 16 percent after the engineering and tech consultancy reported strong third-quarter results. 
Swedish appliances maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) sank 13.5 percent after it trimmed its market demand expectations and forecast higher costs due to increasing raw material prices and tariffs.
Shares in French household appliances maker SEB (PA:SEBF) also fell 15.3 percent after its third-quarter sales figures.
Results from banks were more mixed after more encouraging results from UBS had boosted it in the previous session.
Spain's Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE) topped the IBEX with a 5.5 percent gain after its third-quarter profit beat expectations. 
Britain's RBS (L:RBS) meanwhile tumbled 4 percent after it warned of economic uncertainty and its profit lagged forecasts. The lender said it had taken a 100 million pound impairment provision to account for greater uncertainty.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 03:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Wanda Group explores Legendary Entertainment stake sale - sources,"By Kane Wu, Liana B. Baker and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's Dalian Wanda Group is exploring a partial sale of its Hollywood film studio and the full sale of its sports assets in its latest push to reduce offshore holdings under pressure from Beijing, sources familiar with the matter said.
Deals for the assets would essentially reduce the conglomerate's overseas holdings to a handful of property developments - also reported to be on the block, according to The Real Deal, a U.S. property news website.
The company, led by billionaire Wang Jianlin, once had dreams of developing a China-Hollywood film nexus, had a stake in top-flight Spanish football club Atletico Madrid and owned prime property developments in Sydney and London.
Wanda paid $3.5 billion in early 2016 for Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment, maker of ""Pacific Rim"" and ""The Great Wall"".
It is now exploring the sale of a minority stake, two sources with direct knowledge said, similar to Wanda's recent stake sale in AMC Entertainment (N:AMC), the world's largest cinema operator, a two-part deal that ostensibly gave U.S. private equity group Silver Lake a stake of up to 22 percent via convertible bonds and saw Wanda give up majority control.
New management at Legendary Entertainment has helped clean up its balance sheet and boosted its pipeline of TV and film content, one of the sources said.
The people declined to be named as the information is confidential. 
Wanda said that the report of the sales were ""seriously inconsistent with the facts.""
A representative for Legendary declined to comment.
Wanda is also considering the sale of its sports marketing firm Infront Sports & Media as well as World Triathlon Corp (WTC) - owner of the Ironman Triathlons - the people said, cautioning the plans are not final and could change.
In December last year, Wanda asked a group of investment banks to look into the potential for listing the sports assets, potentially in Hong Kong.
The group has since received offers for the businesses from a number of private equity firms, including CVC Partners. But Wanda considered the offers too low, according to two of the people, who said the unit could yet push for a listing.
CVC declined to comment.
AMC STAKE
Wanda could also sell its remaining stake of 38 percent in AMC Entertainment for the right price, the people said.
Wanda first bought AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, and floated the company in 2013, when it retained a stake of about 60 percent, before entering into the deal with Silver Lake in September.
Under that deal, the private equity firm holds the right of first refusal on certain future sales of AMC shares by Wanda.
AMC, which operates more than 1,000 movie theaters globally, did not respond to a request for comment.
Wanda's retrenchment began after Beijing launched a crackdown in mid-2017 on what it viewed as irrational acquisitions by some Chinese conglomerates.
The group rapidly offloaded $9 billion in domestic hotels and tourism assets to fellow Chinese property developers but has taken longer to cut back its international holdings.
In February, it sold its 17 percent stake in Atletico Madrid and this year has already disposed of prime property developments in London, Sydney and Australia's Gold Coast.

Wanda is now focusing on core domestic businesses, notably its commercial property arm, financial unit, and Wanda Cinema  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN), China's largest cinema operator, said one of source.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's billionaires saw their collective wealth rise 19 percent to $8.9 trillion in 2017, led by growth in China, which minted two new billionaires every week, according to a new report.
A total of 199 billionaires were created over the year globally, with nearly a third gaining their wealth through some form of innovation, while the rest did so by scaling up businesses in the Asia-Pacific region, UBS and consultants PwC said.
Nowhere was this more visible than China, they said in the 2018 edition of their Billionaires Insights Report, with China's billionaires rising to 373 from 318 with joint wealth of $1.12 trillion, up 39 percent.
""China's billionaire entrepreneurs are leading their country's economic transformation, and by extension that of the rest of Asia,"" the report said.
""Over little more than 10 years, they have created some of the world's largest companies, raised living standards and made fortunes at an unprecedented pace.""
UBS, whose wealth management arm manages around $2.5 trillion in assets, and PwC said there were already more billionaires in Asia than in the United States and they were on course to be wealthier than their U.S. peers within three years.
""A new cohort of Chinese entrepreneurs is challenging Silicon Valley, amid rising tensions over trade and intellectual property. They are developing new business models, seizing opportunities, moving rapidly between business sectors.""
China produced 50 so-called 'unicorns' - companies with a valuation of at least $1 billion - from 2016 to 2018, slightly behind the 62 produced in the United States, the report said.

Rapid urbanization and productivity growth would help the young entrepreneurs at the forefront of China's wealth creation continue to reach the ranks of the billionaires in the coming years, it said.

Total assets of state-owned financial enterprises amounted to 241 trillion yuan ($34.6 trillion) in 2017, according to a report published by China’s Ministry of Finance Thursday. Their liabilities were 217.3 trillion yuan last year, according to the report.
“While we are gradually upgrading the management of state financial assets, we have to be aware that there are still institutional and structural contradictions and problems,” said Liu Kun, China’s finance minister, in the report. “The mission of preventing massive risks remains tough.”
The warning comes as China plans to increase the number of companies it deems systemically important financial institutions. Policy makers are stepping up crisis-prevention efforts as the nation’s debt burden swells to unprecedented levels. Centralizing oversight of state-owned financial assets will be needed, the finance ministry said in the report.
All four of the world’s biggest banks by assets are Chinese, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. alone controls $4.1 trillion.

Wall Street favorites in recent years, the FANG stocks have been punished in a month of volatility for U.S. equities that has some investors worried a decade-old bull market may be ending. 
The FANG group, along with heavyweight tech stocks Apple and Microsoft (O:MSFT), have made outsized contributions to the S&P 500's gains in recent years, and a prolonged downturn for those stocks would be a major setback for the market.
After the bell, Amazon tanked 8 percent. The fall came after the online retailer and cloud computing heavyweight reported that its quarterly net sales rose to $56.58 billion from $43.74 billion a year earlier. That missed analyst estimates of $57.1 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Alphabet missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue, while rising expenses trimmed its operating margin for the third straight quarter, fanning concerns about regulatory scrutiny. Its stock fell 4.7 percent.
Reacting after hours, Netflix dipped 3 percent and Facebook, which reports results on Oct. 30, lost 2.3 percent. 
During Thursday's official trading session, all four FANG stocks rallied by between 3 percent and 7 percent, regaining some of the territory lost in recent weeks during a broad market sell-off. The Nasdaq (IXIC) jumped 2.95 percent, but remained down 10 percent from its August record high close.
Apple (O:AAPL) fell 1.6 percent after hours, while Twitter (N:TWTR) dipped 2.5 percent. Earlier in the day, Twitter surged 15 percent in its biggest one-day gain in a year after the social media company easily beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates.
Snap (N:SNAP) slumped 11 percent in extended trade after the Snapchat owner said its number of daily active users fell to 186 million in the third quarter from 188 million in the June quarter, hurt largely by an app redesign and competition from Facebook's Instagram.
Chipmaker Micron Technology (O:MU) lost 3.8 percent in extended trade after  Western Digital  (O:WDC) said it was taking steps to align its output of flash memory chips with projected weak demand. Western Digital dropped 8 percent in extended trade.

 Intel Corp  (O:INTC) jumped 3.5 percent in extended trade after posting one of Thursday's few upbeat quarterly reports.

The S&P 500 index jumped 1.9% to 2,705.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6% to 24,984.55 while the NASDAQ Composite surged 3% to 7,318.34 after its biggest drop in seven years.
The gain in U.S. stocks came despite disappointing earning reports from technology giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Amazon’s shares were 6% lower in after-market trading as its sales and operating income fell short of estimates. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet said its third-quarter revenue also missed forecasts.
Fed policies and a weakening Chinese economy also continued to dent market sentiment, according to analysts.
""The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China's economy will continue to struggle,"" analysts at Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so,” they added.
Looking ahead, markets are likely to focus on the upcoming U.S. third-quarter GDP data due later in the day.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.4% by 10:04 PM ET (02:04 GMT), on track for a slide of almost 5% this week.
Government data showed on Friday that Tokyo’s core consumer price index rose 1.0% in October from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast.
The Bank of Japan's rate review is due next week. Markets widely expect the central bank to maintain a steady monetary policy.
China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2%, while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 0.8% lower.

1321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",ZTE's Profit Dives 65% as It Tries to Move Past U.S. Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- ZTE Corp (HK:0763).’s quarterly earnings slid 65 percent, underscoring a difficult recovery from U.S. sanctions that briefly brought China’s No. 2 telecommunications gear vendor to a standstill.
The state-backed company reported net income of 564.5 million yuan ($81.2 million) for the quarter ended September, compared with its own projection for almost break-even to 1.02 billion yuan. Revenue for the period slipped 14 percent to 19.3 billion yuan.
ZTE is recovering from a months-long U.S. Commerce Department ban on purchases of American technology, including components needed to produce its smartphones and networking equipment. Washington agreed to lift that moratorium -- punishment for violating and lying about sanctions on exports to Iran and North Korea -- only after ZTE agreed to replace its board and senior management and paid more than $1 billion in penalties.
Investors however remain cautious on Chinese corporations as U.S. tensions escalate. ZTE has since initiated a number of efforts to lower costs, including restructuring a smartphone arm that’s become a drag on the overall business. Beijing has also reportedly asked the country’s biggest telecom carriers to favor ZTE when purchasing equipment. In August, the company predicted net income of 24.2 million yuan to 1.02 billion yuan in the September quarter, a wide range that reflected its uncertain prospects.
ZTE is now counting on emerging markets to offset setbacks in developed markets like Australia, which have blacklisted ZTE and rival Huawei Technologies Co. ZTE’s cheaper products enjoy an edge in developing countries.
“Although the U.S. is trying to convince its allies not to use Chinese equipment, emerging market governments generally seem less concerned and trust China more,” Jefferies analysts Edison Lee and Timothy Chau wrote this week. They’re predicting a 5 billion yuan potential profit for 2019.
ZTE’s shares listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen have about halved since the ban was imposed in April. The company has lost roughly $17 billion in valuation year to date.

Demand for stock funds increased during a week when the S&P 500 benchmark erased its gains for the year, partly as more short-sellers demanded more exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that they could bet against, but also as some investors chose to buy the dip.
""It's earnings season and we're seeing some fairly good numbers come out,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper, but he noted the market has also had a strong run for a decade.
""It's been going up and up, and we need a breather.""
S&P 500 third-quarter earnings are up 23.6 percent over the year prior, with four-fifths of companies' profits sitting above Wall Street's expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Technology sector stock funds pulled in $904 million during the week ended Oct. 24, the most cash since June, even as top tech names took a beating during the sell-off, Lipper said. The research service's data estimates sales activity in U.S.-based mutual funds and ETFs.
Bond funds remain under pressure from rising rate expectations. Taxable bond funds posted $4.5 billion in withdrawals during the week, marking a fifth consecutive week of money being pulled out.
High-yield bond funds, which are more speculative and thought to be a leading indicator of interest in stocks, posted $2.4 billion in withdrawals during the week.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 07:46PM ET</span>",Amazon's holiday season sales outlook misses views; shares sink,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) forecast holiday season sales and profit that missed Wall Street targets on Thursday, projecting revenue growth that would be the slowest in years, sending shares of the world's largest online retailer down 8 percent in after-hours trade.
Amazon's third-quarter sales lagged estimates as well. Analysts said international results were disappointing and online competition was increasing. The company blamed accounting changes and cautioned that it was being conservative with its outlook. 
For years, Amazon has made expensive bets on new technology and programs, like its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 to storm the U.S. grocery industry. That has resulted in rollercoaster profits in the past, but revenue has largely grown at a breakneck pace as consumers shifted shopping online and away from brick-and-mortar stores.
""Weak revenue growth stuck out like a sore thumb,"" said George Salmon, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""And when you’re trading on 70 times expected earnings, it doesn’t take much to jolt the share price.""
Amazon's more subdued expectations for this year's holiday shopping season, which runs from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in late November through New Year's, was a particular surprise. It forecast that fourth-quarter sales will rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, or up to $72.5 billion, while analysts were expecting $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
That would be Amazon's lowest quarterly sales growth since at least the start of 2016. In the last four quarters, sales increased between 29 percent and 43 percent. 
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said no fundamentals had changed, just some holiday timing in India and accounting differences.
""We're expecting a strong holiday season, so there's no message in our forward guidance against that,"" he said on a conference call with media. ""We have everything ready to roll.""
The company moved the recording of $300 million in Prime subscription revenue from the fourth quarter to earlier periods in the year, he said. In addition, Amazon faces a tougher year-over-year comparison because the Whole Foods deal closed in the third quarter of 2017, and the different timing of the holiday Diwali affected sales patterns, he said.
""Amazon saw a meaningful slowdown in their international division. They had been hitting on all cylinders so this is something investors weren't ready for,"" Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors, said. 
Amazon forecast fourth-quarter operating income between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion, below the $3.87 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet.
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the results reflected a shifting landscape with retailers holding their own against Amazon.
""Others are now getting better at nibbling away at its dominance,"" he said, citing Walmart (N:WMT), Target  and Macy's (N:M).
PROFITS AND THIRD-PARTY GOODS
Despite slower sales growth, Amazon has steadily become more profitable.
Third-quarter net income rose to $2.88 billion, or $5.75 per share, from $256 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier.
Up to 53 percent of goods sold on Amazon now come from third-party merchants, the company said on Thursday, marking a steady shift away from traditional retail where Amazon is the seller of a product.
That means the company is collecting less revenue but taking in a lucrative cut of others' sales - all the more profitable when merchants pay Amazon to handle their shipping. Seller services grew 31 percent to $10.4 billion in the third quarter.
""They’re indifferent if they sell us their own merchandise or third-party merchandise, so they shouldn’t be punished for the latter,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
More sellers are looking to Amazon to market their products, too - another highly profitable business. Amazon appeals to advertisers because individuals generally are using the site to shop, unlike users browsing Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, the ads sales leader, to find general information or rival  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) to see updates from their friends.
Amazon said revenue from the category and some other items grew 122 percent to $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Olsavsky, the CFO, also said the company is operating more efficiently, hiring less than in the past and adding less warehousing space.
""We’ve really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,"" Olsavsky told reporters, citing cost improvements for cloud unit Amazon Web Services as well.
The world's No.1 cloud business by revenue saw sales up 45.7 percent to $6.68 billion, narrowly edging past estimates of $6.67 billion.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 07:19PM ET</span>",Alphabet misses Wall Street revenue estimates; shares fall,"By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) on Thursday missed analysts' quarterly revenue estimates for the first time in at least two years and reported continuing erosion of its operating margin, sending shares down almost 7 percent after hours.
The tech company's third-quarter results fanned investor concern that big investments in new businesses, increasing regulatory scrutiny and emerging competition are producing slow and unpredictable returns. 
Alphabet disclosed, for example, that passengers of its self-driving Waymo minivans are now paying for rides, but the offering remains limited to the Phoenix, Arizona region and Waymo's finances are not broken out.
Overall revenue rose 21 percent to $33.74 billion, missing analysts' estimate by about $310 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Google ad sales contributed 86 percent of revenue, but growth slowed to 20 percent from nearly 24 percent last quarter.
""Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.""
The company attributed much of the slower revenue growth to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Lower ad pricing to contend with antitrust concerns, new privacy rules in Europe and increased competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) may have played a role too, financial analysts said.
Non-advertising revenue, such as from sales of mobile apps and cloud computing services, also came in slightly below expectations.
Those results combined with rising expenses brought down the company's operating margin to 25 percent from 28 percent a year ago.
After falling as low $1028.77, Shares of Alphabet were down about 3 percent to $1,071.01 after hours from their close at $1103.59.
Alphabet reported net profit of $9.2 billion, or $13.06 per share, compared with $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share in the year-ago quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate of $10.45.
Earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate and favorable valuation of the firm's investments in startups such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].
NEW BUSINESSES
Alphabet has committed to providing cloud computing services and selling hardware over the last few years. It has also ventured into areas where commercial opportunities are nascent, including regions such as India and Nigeria and businesses such as self-driving cars.
The Waymo operation in Phoenix is in the early stages of testing pricing, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call on Thursday, noting that some employers were sponsoring workers' rides.
Priming Alphabet's newer ventures has been costly in terms of marketing and hiring, with about 5,300 employees added in the third quarter. 
Alphabet's cost of revenue was $14.3 billion in the third quarter, up 28 percent from a year ago. Capital expenditures soared to $5.3 billion from $3.5 billion last year, with 20 data center sites in development, Porat said. 
Google has posted strong revenue growth for several years as retailers flock to buy product image ads on Google's search engine and commercials on YouTube.
But Google's cost structure has been disrupted by surges in usage of its services on smartphones, where the company splits ad revenue with technology makers such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL), and smart speakers, where ads do not appear.
Google has been fined $7.7 billion for antitrust violations in Europe over the last two years, and heightened attention on privacy, security, competition and the rise of artificial intelligence tools has led investors to fret about potentially costly regulatory scrutiny in the United States and elsewhere.
The steady revenue growth had helped Alphabet weather an otherwise bruising last few months on the stock market for big technology and communications companies. 

Alphabet gained 5.8 percent this year before Thursday and traded at 24 times expected earnings over the next year. Shares of No. 2 online ad firm  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which faces questions about flattening usage limiting revenue growth, had fallen 12.5 percent and were trading at 19 times future earnings.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Mexican couriers seek changes to trade deal to access U.S. market,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Courier companies in Mexico seeking better access to the lucrative U.S. market are pressuring lawmakers to try to improve the terms of a trade deal struck on Sept. 30 with the United States and Canada, industry officials said.
U.S. firms, such as FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), are allowed to operate in Mexico alongside domestic companies, but Mexican couriers, like market leader Estafeta, are barred from using their own vehicles for shipments between U.S. cities.
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), due to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, would keep those rules intact, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump's vows to protect U.S. jobs.
""We've always asked for a level playing field,"" said Manuel Armendariz, president of Mexico's packaging and courier association, which represents about 30 firms.
The industry was lobbying Mexican lawmakers to press for changes, Armendariz said.
Vanessa Rubio, a Mexican senator, said Mexico could address the issue through national legislation. She also noted that USMCA led to the creation of a transport committee with members from all three countries, which could consider complaints.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office declined to comment.
Mexican freight forwarders are concerned about a clause the United States included in the new pact, which the three countries' leaders aim to sign by the end of November.
That clause could allow the United States to revoke authorization of Mexican freight-forwarders operating long-haul cross-border trips, such as from Tijuana to New York, if U.S. firms can show they are losing market share to Mexican rivals.
Mexican firms are upset they do not have the same right.
""If they can cancel without prior notice ... we also want this right,"" said Enrique Gonzalez, president of Mexico's National Chamber of Freight Transport (CANACAR).
CANACAR is seeking a side letter to the trade deal that would resolve the conflict, said its vice president, Jose Refugio Munoz.
Mexican carriers authorized to make international trips are a small percentage of the U.S. freight market.
The U.S. Department of Transportation said it authorized 41 Mexican companies to provide long-distance services, comprising 493 drivers. In the United States, there are about 3.5 million freight drivers, it said.
""We're very far from being (a threat),"" Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an appearance in front of lawmakers this week.
The Mexican Economy Ministry did not respond to a separate request for comment on the matter.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 06:37PM ET</span>","Snap expects to lose more users, shares plunge","By Sheila Dang and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) lost more users than Wall Street expected in the third quarter as it continued to grapple with an unpopular redesign of its Snapchat photo-messaging app and fierce competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's Instagram.
Daily active users are expected to fall again next quarter, Snap Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told analysts on a conference call, which would mark the third sequential quarter of user declines.
Snap shares, which have lost more than 52 percent since the beginning of the year, tumbled 10 percent in after-hours trade as the company failed to convince Wall Street 2019 would be better.
During the call, Stone dashed hopes that Snap had set a firm target to reach full-year profitability in 2019. That ambition was outlined in a leaked internal memo from Chief Executive Evan Spiegel earlier this month.
""Bear in mind that an internal stretch goal is not a forecast and is not guidance,"" Stone said.
The number of daily active users on Snapchat fell to 186 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from 188 million three months earlier. Daily active users numbered 178 million in the prior-year quarter.
Spiegel said the company planned to add users by going after older users in the United States and Europe and expanding internationally to reach 13 to 34-year olds, the app's core demographic.
But one of Snap's biggest problems is it ""has an unclear vision on how to break out beyond the under-30 demographic in a very crowded social media landscape,"" said Jessica Liu, an analyst at Forrester.
The latest users figure, widely watched by investors and advertisers, also fell short of analysts' average estimate of 187.56 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Wall Street had been expecting Snapchat's users to rise to 192.84 million next quarter.
The redesigned Snapchat app aimed at creating a more personalized service has struggled to attract more users since its roll-out last year and newer versions have been criticized for being too confusing to use.
The number of advertisers active on Snapchat remains small compared with Facebook and Instagram but is steadily growing, analysts at Stifel said on Wednesday, citing data from Merkle.
Still, the company topped analysts' revenue expectations and average revenue per user jumped. Revenue growth was helped by increased adoption of the company's programmatic ad sales platform, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks.
Snap's overall revenue jumped about 43 percent to $297.7 million, topping Wall Street expectations of $283.2 million.
Average revenue per user increased to $1.60 during the third quarter, from $1.17 a year earlier, helped by growth outside North America.
Net loss narrowed to $325.1 million or 25 cents per share, from $443.2 million or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Snap lost 12 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 14 cents per share.
Snap also said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of between $355 million and $380 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $371 million.
Earlier this month, Snap announced new scripted shows for Snapchat to attract users and increase the amount of time they spend on the app. Snap said the serialized episodes will be ad-supported and fast-paced for mobile viewing.

Snap said Wednesday it hired Jeremi Gorman, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s head of global advertising sales, as its chief business officer. It also hired Jared Grusd as chief strategy officer. Grusd was CEO of media site HuffPost.

Pichai sent an email to Google employees in response to a New York Times story that was published earlier in the day.
The report said the search engine giant protected three senior executives from allegations of sexual misconduct by offering them payouts. 
The email, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said of the 48 that were fired, 13 were senior managers or held more senior posts.
However, Pichai said none of those employees received an exit package. 
The email, which was also signed by Google's vice president of people operations Eileen Naughton, said that company employees could use internal tools to report cases of inappropriate behavior anonymously. 
It also said that Google has updated its policy to require all vice presidents and senior vice presidents to disclose any relationship with a co-worker regardless of reporting line or presence of conflict.
""We are committed to ensuring that Google is a workplace where you can feel safe to do your best work, and where there are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately,"" the email said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you were writing a script about Ricky Gervais’ life, it would probably be rejected for having too many fanciful plot twists.
Someone from a failed new-wave pop band starts a nondescript office job, turns the experience into one of the biggest TV smashes ever, and now has one of the most lucrative careers in the history of stand-up comedy?
Gervais, 57 – whose game show ""Child Support"" began a slate of new episodes on Oct. 5, on ABC – spoke with Reuters to discuss the “Life Lessons” learned on his wild ride.
Q: Did you get your sense of humor from your parents?
A: My dad was very dry and sarcastic. I remember one time my mom was complaining about how we were going to have to pay for his funeral one day, and he lowered his newspaper and said ""Just bury me in the garden."" He didn’t care. He buried everything in the garden: Cookers, fridges, pets. Sometimes I wonder about what future archaeologists will think.
Q: What was their attitude toward money?
A: We didn’t have any! Back then men worked hard, but women had to work miracles. My mom would scrimp and save, and do whatever it took for us to have a good future. I couldn’t have luxuries like a bike or a skateboard, but I could always have any book I wanted. And if I needed a jumper, she would knit it because it was cheaper.
I remember my dad used to win bets on the horses sometimes, and he would hide the money under the carpet. My mom found the stash one day, and instead of confronting him, she just stole a bit of it now and then. Because what was he going to say?
Q: You actually started out in the music business?
A: I taught myself guitar at 14. My mom went into the center of Reading, England, and got the cheapest guitar, which was five pounds. I remember punching and biting it because I couldn’t hold the chords down. I did join a band eventually, and we got signed, and then it was all over as quickly as it happened.
Q: What was your first real job?
A: One of my mate’s dads had a factory in Wimbledon, England, that made those conference tables with flat wood tops and tubular metal legs. My job was to take long tubes out of a big vat of oil, and grind down the edges. Why is that even a job? I remember being very depressed. It made me realize I never wanted to do that for a living.
But I guess I was doing it too fast, because the bloke in the next cubicle poked his head over and said ""What are you trying to prove? Slow down, you’re making the rest of us look bad!"" That’s a life lesson right there. 
Q: When you eventually hit it big with ""The Office,"" how did you handle that fame and wealth?
A: It was weird, because it came somewhat later in life. It was never about the money, because I had been poor all my life. 
When the first check came through, it sort of ruined it a little bit. I had done something I was really proud of, and this muddied the water. But I got over it.
Growing up, money was something you needed in case you didn’t die tomorrow. I knew I wouldn’t blow it because I’m not an idiot. I wasn’t about to spend it on cars or drugs or gambling.
Q: Since you are a big dog lover, do most of your charitable dollars go towards animal charities?
A: I speak for animals because they don’t have a voice. So on my tour, at every location, I donated premium tickets whose proceeds were split between animal and human charities. In some countries they don’t even think of animals as sentient beings, they treat them like furniture. People just don’t realize the cruelty behind what’s on their plates, or in the supermarket. So animals need my voice, and I’m going to shout until I’m blue in the face.
Q: What is your best life advice for people?
A: Relax, because no one else knows what they’re doing either. Life is amazing: The odds that we are here at all, that a sperm hit an egg and we even exist, are 400 trillion to one. So you’ve got to enjoy it.

1334,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 05:02PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Amazon Sales Worry Bulls
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks to be a drag on market tomorrow at the start of trading.
The online retail giant guided sales and operating income below consensus estimates after the bell, sending its stock down more than 6% postmarket. Quarterly sales also fell short of forecasts.
Amazon closed the regular trading session up more than 7%.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely also add to weakness as its quarterly revenue fell short of some Wall Street expectations.
The stock lost 4% in after-hours trading.
But Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) repaid the faith of bulls in the chip sector during the regular session, posting solid numbers and rising 2.5% postmarket.
2. GDP Expected to Decline, but Remain Solid
Economic attention will be all on tomorrow’s GDP number.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis is expected to release the numbers on third-quarter economic growth at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
GDP from July to September is expected to have risen at an annual rate of 3.3%, according to economists surveyed by Investing.com. That’s down from the second-quarter pace, but still on track for a 3% rise for 2018, the most since 2005.
Although analysts expect the strong expansion to continue in the fourth quarter on the back of recovery efforts following the recent Hurricanes Florence and Michael, most economists expect growth to moderate in 2019 and warn of the possible fallout from simmering trade disputes.
3. Colgate-Palmolive Leads Earnings Card
Tomorrow’s earnings calendar is predictably lighter, but there’s no dearth of big names.
Consumer giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will get a lot of attention. On average analysts are looking for a profit of 73 cents per share on sales of about $3.9 billion.
The company fell short on sales in its last quarter. Shares had been climbing since then, but fell sharply recently in the broader market selloff.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A muted response by Wall Street's main gauge of investor fear to the drubbing U.S. stocks took earlier this week has left many investors wondering if the VIX index (VIX)was caught napping.
Market participants say that a healthy level of hedging activity going into the sell-off and the recent upward bid for Treasury prices explains the volatility index's relative calm.
U.S. stocks plunged on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPX) dropping 3 percent on the day. But the VIX, which moves in the opposite direction, rose only 4.5 points. Equities staged a rebound on Thursday, and volatility expectations retreated.
""While the VIX has gone up it has not gone up as much as one might think,"" said Eric Metz, chief investment officer at SpiderRock Advisors LLC in Chicago.
Rarely over the last 10 years has the VIX been so slow to react. For example, the fear gauge jumped nearly 13 points when the S&P 500 fell about 4 percent on Aug. 24, 2015, and it rose 10.5 points after the S&P lost 3.9 percent on May 20, 2010.
On average, over the last decade, a decline of 3 percent to 4 percent in the S&P 500 index has led to a 6-point jump in the VIX.
""A cynic might say that the VIX is asleep at the wheel,"" said Michael Purves, head of equity derivatives strategy at Weeden & Co in New York.
Well-hedged investors may be the explanation, said Metz.
For S&P 500 options, there are nearly 2 puts open for each open call, a level of defensive positioning that is close to the highest it has been since the volatility shock in February of this year, according to Trade Alert.
""If people are well-hedged going into these events, then the need to put on protection during them is lessened. When you do get the sell-off the panic element is muted,"" said Metz.
The recent strong bid for Treasuries may also help to explain the muted VIX, said Purves.
U.S. Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction of Treasury prices, fell to three-week lows on Wednesday.
A somewhat concerted slump in both equities and Treasuries earlier this month had spooked investors who rely on the typically inverse relationship between stocks and bonds to act as a diversifier for their portfolios.
With that traditional relationship back in play on Wednesday, investors had lesser reason to panic and drive up the VIX, Purves said.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron in talks to buy Brazilian oil company's Texas refinery - sources,"By Erwin Seba and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
HOUSTON/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) has held talks to acquire Pasadena Refining System Inc (PRSI), a Texas oil refining unit of Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), three people familiar with the matter said this week. 
U.S. oil companies are looking to expand refining operations to handle rising volumes of crude flowing from the country's shale fields. A deal for PRSI would give Chevron an oil refinery that can process about 110,000 barrels-per-day of light crude. 
Chevron is also discussing a gas liquids processing joint venture with  Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI), largest energy infrastructure provider in North America, two of the sources said. Kinder Morgan operates a nearby plant that separates gas liquids into ethane, propane and other fuels.
The sources requested anonymity to discuss the confidential talks. They did not disclose the deal price.
Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment. 
Chevron and Kinder Morgan declined to comment.
Petrobras, which is deeply in debt, has been seeking to divest $21 billion in assets by year-end but has faced union resistance and legal obstacles. A presidential election on Sunday could raise obstacles for a sale with front-runner Jair Bolsonaro promising to install new managers at the company.
The PRSI refinery has been limited in the type of crude it can run since a 2011 fire, which left one of its processing units idle. A buyer would have to invest to upgrade the refinery, one of the people familiar with the matter said. But PRSI includes open land that could enable a future owner to easily expand the plant.
Petrobras put the plant, which is on the Houston Ship Channel leading to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has its own export docks, on the market earlier this year after sinking more than $1.18 billion into the operation since 2006.
Garfield Miller, chief executive of energy investment bank Aegis Energy Advisors, said the U.S. shale-oil boom has given a second chance to U.S. plants designed to process lighter crudes. Several years ago Petrobras would not have been able to sell PRSI because of its age and inability to process heavy crudes, he said.
That has changed with the growth of the Permian Basin, the nation's largest oilfield, which now produces 3.5 million barrels per day of oil, according to U.S. government figures.
""Anyone with crude in the Permian might logically want to own it,"" said Miller. ""This refinery today has value, whereas eight or nine years ago it had none."" 
Pierre Breber, Chevron's head of refining and chemicals, this month said the company wanted to build or buy a refinery along the U.S. Gulf Coast to process oil from its West Texas operations.

Chevron's shale output from the region jumped 51 percent in the second quarter to 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By expanding its refining capacity to Houston, it would be able to process the crude closer to where it is produced.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","Third Point sues Campbell Soup, accuses it of misleading investors","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Tom Hals
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Third Point LLC sued  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) on Thursday, alleging the soup and snack maker's board misled investors about the competence of its directors and the way it carried out a recently completed strategic review.
The lawsuit is the latest move in a bitter proxy contest in which billionaire investor Dan Loeb and his Third Point hedge fund wants to replace Campbell's 12-member board so it can appoint its own directors and try to revitalize the company's growth.
In a lawsuit filed in state superior court in Camden, New Jersey, which is Campbell's home town, Third Point said Campbell and its board ""breached their fiduciary duties to Campbell's stockholders by withholding material information critical to stockholders assessing how to vote at the company's annual meeting."" 
It asked the court to prevent Campbell from holding its annual meeting on Nov. 29 until the board corrects what Third Point called its misstatements.
Three heirs of condensed soup inventor John Dorrance, who ran the company a century ago, sit on the board and are seeking re-election. Together they control 37 percent of Campbell's stock. Third Point has asked the court to postpone shareholders' votes on the board until the company corrects what Third Point described as misinformation by the board.
The lawsuit says the company failed to disclose critical information about its directors, including Dorrance's grandchild Bennett Dorrance. It accused the company of not making adequately clear what Dorrance's business ventures and investments were, among other things.
Dorrance did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.
Earlier on Thursday, Campbell's board chairman wrote a letter to investors saying that Third Point's proposed directors were not qualified to oversee the company and that Third Point had not presented any new ideas or specific strategic plan.
""Third Point has, at best, a superficial understanding of the food industry and the company, as evidenced by its non-substantive plan filled with platitudes and business school buzzwords,"" the letter to shareholders said.
Such lawsuits are not uncommon in proxy battles as both sides seek every advantage. Third Point said in the suit that it needs the court's help to wage a ""meaningful proxy contest"" and for investors to make fully informed decisions. 
Third Point says in its lawsuit that shareholders do not have enough information to assess the company's strategic plans, which includes selling some divisions and finding a permanent chief executive to replace Denise Morrison who left in May.
""Without further information about its strategic plan that the board has withheld, and that is unknowable to stockholders without further disclosure, the Nov. 29 director election will be a sham,"" the lawsuit said.

Third Point also said that investors are in the dark about the new CEO selection process.

Mattel said lower sales of Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends products resulted in an 18 percent decline in international sales during the three months ended Sept. 30.
Mattel mis-forecast demand in China relative to supply and is taking action to better manage inventories at retailers, Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz said in an interview.
Mattel and other toy manufacturers have also been rattled in recent years by a consumer shift toward thousands of small toy sellers online as well as kids increasingly preferring toys based on Hollywood movie franchises and YouTube shows.
Mattel's larger rival,  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS), earlier this week blamed those changing consumer tastes in part for its own decline in international revenue.
El Segundo, California-based Mattel's North American gross sales rose 5.6 percent, marking the first increase in at least six quarters and allaying some concerns about the effects of the retailer Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy last year.
Four analysts on average had expected a near 13 percent drop in North American sales, according to Refinitiv data.
The rise contrasts with results from Hasbro, which said the liquidation of Toys 'R' Us was still having a lingering impact on its U.S. and Canadian businesses.
Mattel on Thursday also said it would consider strategic alternatives for its manufacturing facilities.
Its overall third-quarter net sales fell 8 percent to $1.44 billion, below the $1.49 billion expected by analysts on average.
Mattel reported a net income of $6.3 million, compared with a loss of $603.3 million a year earlier, when the company had higher tax expenses.
Excluding one-time items, Mattel recorded a loss of 18 cents per share.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 400.93 points, or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.35, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 49.5 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.6 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34.

1350,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Returns to Positive for the Year After 400-Point Rally,"Investing.com - The Dow returned to positive territory for the year Thursday, recouping losses from a rout the prior day, led by surge in tech as bargain-hunting investors piled into beaten-up stocks on the back of reassuring earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.63%. The S&P 500 rose 1.86%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.95%. Strong gains for the Dow and Nasdaq saw both indexes escape correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from the most recent peak.
The major averages were rescued from correction territory as investors viewed the rout from a day earlier as a buying opportunity, with tech attracting the bulk of investor dollars following bullish earnings from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Microsoft posted earnings and revenue Wednesday after the close that handily beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares soaring nearly 6%. Twitter rallied more than 15% after comfortably exceeding consensus revenue and earnings estimates.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) swung to a surprise third-quarter profit, though some on Wall Street put the brakes on optimism, questioning whether this is ""as good as it gets"" for the electric automaker.
Tesla's exposure to China tariffs on imported components and its offering of lower-priced vehicles would likely compress margins in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said. ""We question if this is not as good as it gets (for Tesla) from a near-term upside surprise for shares.""
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), however, tempered optimism on earnings after it guided fourth-quarter revenues below consensus estimates. Its shares slumped about 15%.
Still, chipmakers managed a decent showing for the day, led by a rally in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The SPDR S&P Semiconductor (NYSE:XSD) gained more than 2%, clawing back some losses from a day earlier, when the sector suffered its worst slump since Nov. 2018.
Energy also contributed to the rebound in the broader average as oil prices continued to pare early-week losses on renewed hopes that OPEC will cut supplies before the year is out.
The spring-loaded rebound on Wall Street comes as analysts asserted the recent selloff was overdone as the outlook for earnings and U.S. economic growth remained favourable.
""The nearly 10% decline in U.S. stocks over the last month appears excessive relative to the risks,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Market participants will get a first look at the pace of U.S. economic growth on Friday, with the released of preliminary third-quarter GDP data.
In corporate news,  Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) rose nearly 9% ahead of the release of its popular Western shoot-em-up ""Red Dead Redemption II,"" due Friday, expected to be a big hit among gamers. Analysts didn’t hold back in their remarks about the importance of the game to Take-Two's growth.
""People have been anticipating this launch for years,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz told the WSJ. ""If you're looking for what's the net growth driver for the company, you are looking at this game.""

By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - British investor Martin Taylor, who closed his $1.5 billion hedge fund Nevsky Capital and retired at 46, plans to get back in the market with a fresh perspective and a new firm.
In December 2015, Taylor and Nick Barnes, who he considers a co-founder of Nevsky, told investors it was not likely they could reproduce past gains and gave clients their money back.
It was a rare move in the industry and it came after a volatile year in financial markets with falls in oil, commodities and emerging markets.
In a colorful letter to investors, Taylor said Nevsky's future returns would be hampered by distorted macroeconomic data, the rise of highly unpredictable nationalist governments and algorithmic funds exacerbating volatility in stocks.
But, after nearly three years out, he is launching London-based global long-short equities hedge fund Crake Asset Management in October 2019 to bet on shares and trade underlying commodities.
The strategy mirrors that of Nevsky.
""I did retire and I did say I was never going to come back and I absolutely did mean it at the time, but obviously I've now changed my mind,"" said Taylor, 49, who has spent the past two years teaching and trading his own money.
""With hindsight, what I realized is I was exhausted. I'd been running a hedge fund manager for more than 15 years,"" he told Reuters. ""Now, I've had a two-and-a-half-year sabbatical, it's left me refreshed and I want to do this for another 15 years.""
Two investors who declined to be identified told Reuters they welcomed the move. 
The rise of algorithmic trading during his break meant that by the time he returns markets may be closer to a tipping point at which it will become easier for a fund like his to make money, he said.
""The increasing dominance of passive investors will eventually make underlying markets more inefficient because there will be fewer and fewer genuinely active managers in the market,"" he said.
""FIRST LOVE""
At his new firm, Taylor will be joined by co-founders Yuri Maslov, a former partner at Nevsky, and Richard Walker, who has previously worked at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), according to filings with Britain's Companies House.
Taylor will be the fund's chief investment officer and manager while Maslov will be head of research and Walker chief operating officer and co-manager.
Crake will also be adding four to five analysts over the next several months, and aims to have the team in place in April. It will begin accepting outside money from Oct. 1. 2019.
""Having had 2.5 years off, I’m very keen to get back to my first love but I want to do it properly. That is why it won’t be another year until I take money from clients,"" he said. ""I need to build and train my team first.""
Nevsky Fund Plc's assets peaked at $3.6 billion and it returned 18.4 percent annually net of fees over 15 years. Its average peer returned 2.5 percent over the same time period, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed.
Nevsky was launched in 2000 by Taylor, Eoghan Flanagan and Rory Landman, who left the business in 2005 and is now senior bursar at Trinity College, Cambridge.
Taylor is a fan of West Ham United soccer club and he opposed Britain's departure from the European Union. He donated around 745,000 pounds to Britain's Labour party between 2012 and 2017, according to Electoral Commission data.
""I'm absolutely going to remain in Britain regardless of what happens with Brexit,"" he said.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 03:04PM ET</span>",U.S. shale producers eye global pricing as exports surge,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Ayenat Mersie
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three years after a ban on crude oil exports was lifted, some U.S. shale producers are doing something they have never done before - lock in prices for their barrels that will find a home overseas. 
Shale companies, primarily those operating in the Permian basin, the biggest U.S. oilpatch, are finding new ways of insulating themselves from the wide discount of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) to the global benchmark Brent .
In the second quarter, as WTI's discount to Brent whipsawed and widened to the most in over three years,  WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX), SM Energy Co (N:SM) and  Oasis Petroleum  Inc (N:OAS) began quietly erecting specialized hedges, a Reuters analysis of company filings found. 
The hedges, the first of their kind for these producers, protect against that discount widening as their oil increasingly gets sold to foreign buyers. 
The hedged volumes are relatively small, but indicate the rising importance of export revenues as the U.S. plays an increasingly dominant role as a global oil supplier. 
U.S. oil production is near a record 11 million barrels per day (bpd), depressing the price of WTI versus Brent, while also spurring an export boom. Since the lifting of a 40-year ban in 2015, crude exports surged to as much as 3 million bpd in June.
Traders closely watch the spread between the two benchmarks to gauge export economics. While a wider discount makes U.S. oil attractive to foreign buyers, for producers, it means weaker revenues. Locking the spread in protects export-related revenues. 
LOOKING TO WORLD PRICES
Permian producers have long protected future revenue through financial instruments, but they have typically been solely linked to WTI. That is changing, according to filings and interviews with brokers, bankers, hedging consultants and company executives.
""Previously, all of our sales would be really tied to domestic indices,"" said Todd Scruggs, vice president and treasurer of WPX Energy. ""The fact that we can have our barrels sold internationally is a new thing - and we're happy to take advantage of that."" 
Companies identified a price - in this case for WTI to trade at a discount of around $8 a barrel to Brent - and use contracts known as ""basis swaps"" to lock in prices at that level. Basis swaps have become popular among Permian producers to manage the spread between regional oil prices in West Texas against U.S. futures. But now companies are using the swaps to hedge Brent versus WTI.
In the second quarter, WPX used Brent-WTI basis swaps to hedge 3,000 bpd of 2020 production at a $8.40 WTI discount to Brent. If two years from now, Brent trades at $90 a barrel and WTI at $80, WPX' effective price will be $81.60. 
""When we lock in the Brent-WTI spread, we're effectively ensuring that the sales arrangements that we've made will stay in the money going forward,"" said Scruggs. 
WPX, however, could be exposed if that spread were to contract to a level narrower than the fixed price. 
WTI currently trades at about $9.35 below Brent. During the second quarter, the spread went from about $4.50 to as much as $11.57.
U.S. SHALE EXPORTS RISE 
This hedging practice is likely to gain prominence given rising U.S. crude exports and shale producers looking to capture the higher prices available on world markets, said John Saucer, a vice president at advisers Mobius Risk Group. 
SM Energy hedged about 1.29 million barrels for 2020 at a $7.97 discount, with additional volumes hedged through 2022. An SM Energy spokeswoman said such swaps are a small component of its overall hedging strategy. 
SM Energy's basis swaps cover a portion of its Midland production ""with sales contracts that settle at ICE Brent prices,"" according to a securities filing. 
Oasis Petroleum hedged 153,000 barrels, or nearly 3 percent of 2018 production, at a $10.50 differential and slightly more volumes in 2019 at the same price. The company, which did not respond to requests for comment, recently acquired acreage in the Permian and operates in North Dakota's Bakken region. 
There may be soon be more efficient ways to lock in prices for oil exports as new Gulf Coast futures, which are based on pricing in Houston rather than at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub, are launched. 
However, infrastructure bottlenecks at U.S. coastal ports could cap exports, keeping WTI depressed.
""Banks are making a big push to offer differentiated hedging solutions,"" said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain must hold enough cash to withstand any disorderly Brexit hitting financial markets next March, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Thursday.
Woods said he was making sure that Britain's departure from the European Union is as smooth as possible for markets, even if there is no exit deal between London and Brussels.
""Just in case things go badly we have been working with firms to ensure they have in place liquidity sufficient to accommodate a severe dislocation in financial markets,"" Woods told an audience of bankers.
""We all need to be ready for a range of outcomes."" he said at the annual City of London dinner in the capital's financial district.
Britain is legislating to allow banks and insurers in the EU to continue serving UK customers after Brexit, even if Britain crashes out of the bloc with no transition deal.
""We encourage all firms to opt into the regime because it will provide certainty until March 2022, independent of the existence and duration of any wider implementation period,"" Woods said.
""This is a straightforward, common sense way of lowering the risk of disruption to the City of London,"" said Woods, head of the BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA), which supervises banks.
The BoE published a welter of papers on Thursday to help the sector get ready for Brexit.
Woods urged the EU to mirror these efforts to ensure that financial contracts such as insurance policies and derivatives don't face disruption, whatever happens next March.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the same event that British regulators ""urgently"" need their EU counterparts to begin joint talks on cross-border memorandums of understanding.
""This technical, regulator-to-regulator coordination is essential to minimize disruption in a no-deal situation,"" Bailey said.
The City is worried that the EU is dragging its feet, piling pressure on banks in Britain to shift staff and operations before March to countries that will remain in the EU.
Britain and the EU want a ""standstill"" transition period from March until the end of 2020 as part of a divorce settlement that has yet to be agreed.
CLOSELY ALIGNED
Bailey said there were good reasons for Britain to ""seek to stay closely aligned to the EU"" in financial regulation - comments that are likely to dismay pro-Brexit lawmakers who see exit from the bloc as an opportunity to ease up some rules to keep London competitive globally.
Bailey said Britain and the EU could commit to acknowledging formally that their respective financial rules were ""equivalent"" as early as possible to allow two-way business and remove potential ""cliff edges"" next March.
New rules that require Britain's banks to ""ring fence"" their retail arms with capital cushions come into force next year.
The aim is to ensure deposits are kept safe whatever happens to the rest of the bank, and Woods said it was important that these new units remain independent. ""We are setting up a border patrol of PRA staff who will police the fence,"" he said.
Woods also warned he would be asking ""more pointedly and regularly than before"" whether pay and bonuses of senior bankers reflect their success or failure in tasks such as avoiding operational glitches.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 02:43PM ET</span>",Few see Trump-friendly U.S. stock recovery before elections,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's favorite report card on his presidency may be failing him at a critical moment.
U.S. stocks have fared well since Trump took office, a fact he has repeatedly touted, but have stumbled badly in October. The S&P 500 (SPX) is down 7.6 percent and on course for its biggest monthly drop of Trump's presidency with fewer than two weeks before voters determine whether his Republican Party retains control of Congress.
Republicans have emphasized Trump's stewardship of the economy and recent record stock market highs in their campaigns. It is unclear whether a last-minute market drop will be a persuasive factor for voters. 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted the week ended Oct. 16 found 51 percent of respondents approve of Trump's handling of the economy, compared with 45 percent who approve his job performance overall. 
But with only 12 days remaining, few expect a sustained snap back in stocks before Election Day given a suddenly shaky global environment for risk assets.
""The market is likely to be in a retreat until early November,"" said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group. ""This time period dovetails well with the midterm elections.""
The last time U.S. stocks fell anywhere close to this much in the month preceding a national election was October 2008, when the financial crisis was in full swing and the S&P 500 dropped 16.9 percent. 
That year, Democrats retained control of Congress and Barack Obama ended eight years of Republican control of the White House.
When measured from their election dates until the first midterms of their administrations, Trump's stock market still has an upper hand relative to Obama's. 
The S&P 500 is up nearly 26 percent since Trump's election on Nov. 7, 2016. By contrast, the index rose less than 4 percent between Obama's election and the 2010 midterms, which saw Republicans recapture the House.
PROFITS KNOCKED BY TRADE
The U.S. stock market has been upended by a tepid start to earnings season, with  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and 3M Co (N:MMM) warning their growth could be knocked off-kilter by trade tariffs, which are one of Trump’s signature policies in his attempt to revive U.S. manufacturing. 
""The trade concerns that we've been worried about for most of this year are finally being realized in the market,"" said Kirk Hartman, global chief investment officer with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.
Overall, 179 out of the 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500 have fallen 20 percent or more from recent highs, putting them in bear territory. An additional 174 stocks have fallen between 10 percent and 20 percent, leaving them in what is known as a correction. 
At the same time, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates to curb inflation with the unemployment rate near 40-year lows and the U.S. economy still benefiting from the fiscal stimulus of Republican-led tax cuts passed in December.
Higher rates often slow an economy by making borrowing for mortgages, credit cards and other loans more expensive. 
Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a two-year low, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, a decline economists pinned on the nearly 1 percentage point increase in 30-year fixed mortgage rates year to date. 
""People are getting very nervous, meaning the big money managers. The fault here lies with the Fed, in my opinion, they have pushed rates too high and too fast and keep talking about doing more,"" said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc.
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Wednesday he expects the central bank to raise rates three times in 2019, to a range of 2.75 percent to 3 percent, echoing the three hikes expected by economists polled by Reuters. 
Trump has taken to increasingly attacking the Fed for raising interest rates. 
Despite recent market turmoil, some investors said fears of a deeper selloff are overblown. 
""It takes a while to get through a volatility spike and there is a bottoming process, but fundamentals are in place for the market to go higher,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors who said that his firm remains especially bullish on small-cap U.S. stocks, which are down nearly 14 percent for the month to date. 
""The market is offering up better values now and we want to buy it."" 
Yet others expect that large investors such as pension funds and mutual funds will continue to unload stocks as interest rates rise and the future growth of the U.S. economy looks more uncertain. 
""There's an old saying that retail opens the market and institutions close it,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of Datatrek Research. ""This to me says real institutional selling. It means it isn't over.""

While there are no tariffs on the boxes themselves, the packaging is used by U.S. food companies to ship goods that are now facing Chinese duties. As exports wane, that’s trickling through to demand for the boxes made by Memphis-based International Paper Co., said Chief Executive Officer Mark Sutton. While the financial toll from the small number of products has so far been “limited,” the company has “heightened” concerns that the dispute will have secondary effects on its business, he said.
Some tariffs “end up being in our supply chain,” Sutton said by telephone Thursday. “Both China and the U.S. sort of need each other, and we just hope the elected officials can arrive at the conclusion before too much damage is done.”
International Paper Surges Most in Three Years as Earnings Beat
China’s tariffs have increased pressure on American protein exporters and could mean less demand for cardboard boxes, Sutton said. Some International Paper customers in the food segment are still figuring out what to do with the supplies that used to go to China, he said.
“That’s all evolving right now,” Sutton said. “You can’t change supply chains immediately.”"

(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) on Thursday will unveil an urban delivery test in Seattle that uses electric bicycles geared to carry packages in large preloaded boxes to save time and cut pollution, the company said.
The new project from UPS, which started in Seattle in 1907 as a bicycle messenger company, comes as deliveries of online purchases surge. UPS and its rivals - including FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) - are also searching for ways to slash delivery costs and vehicle emissions. 
UPS partnered with Silver Eagle Manufacturing and Truck Trikes to design the cargo eBike, which has a battery-powered electric motor, for the test, which begins on Nov. 5, UPS said. 
The bike hauls replaceable, 95 cubic-foot boxes that carry packages weighing up to 400 lbs, UPS said, adding that the trailer and replaceable container configuration of the bike is a U.S. first. The rider will pick up pre-loaded containers from a designated city parking spot and return them empty. 
Using pre-loaded cargo boxes ""wipes out"" the double handling of packages and helps to shrink delivery costs, Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters. 
UPS, the world's biggest package delivery company, already has walking and bicycle delivery projects in more than 30 cities, including Dublin, Rome, London and Pittsburgh. The company is also testing 9,300 low-emission vehicles around the world. 

UPS, FedEx and  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) unit DHL face pressure from regulators around the world to lessen the environmental impact of their fleets.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Moody's turns 'positive' as retailers reaps rewards from strong U.S. economy,"(Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's Investor Service changed its outlook on the U.S. retail industry to ""positive"" on Thursday, for the first time since July 2015, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy and benefits from the retailers' online investments. 
The retail industry has seen a resurgence this year with increased consumer spending and higher wages after being plagued for years by falling traffic with the emergence of online shopping. 
After a tough run, U.S retail is starting to reap benefits from its investments to improve e-commerce capabilities and in-store experiences, coupled with a strong U.S economy and low employment, Moody's said.
""A lot has changed in the U.S retail industry since late 2017, with the industry finally starting to gain traction from investments made over the past couple of years,"" Moody's said. 
Moody's raised its 2018 sales growth forecast for U.S retail industry between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent, from a prior range of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent. 
The agency also said online sales, which it expects to generate a ""strong"" operating profit growth in 2019, will continue to outpace overall retail growth as more companies harness e-commerce, which is still 15 percent of overall U.S. retail sales. 
Moody's added that declines in department store chains would taper in 2019. 
The rating change comes as retailers prepare for the all-important holiday shopping season with expectations for sales to be up more than 4 percent this year, according to National Retail Federation.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Khashoggi crisis may test Saudi PIF's expansion ambitions,"By Andrew Torchia, Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - A year ago the Saudi sovereign investor Public Investment Fund (PIF) was a rising star among state-backed funds. 
It poured billions of dollars into the SoftBank technology fund of Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and the infrastructure vehicle of U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX), and was building a war chest for overseas deals.
PIF, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, emerged as the most viable partner for foreign investors after an anti-corruption purge last year tainted many members of the Saudi business elite. 
    But the outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month has made some Western firms reluctant to deal with PIF, threatening to slow some of its grandiose projects and global investments.
""Firms in sectors with a stronger CSR (corporate social responsibility) profile, including U.S.-based tech, will have a harder time accepting PIF money,"" said Steffen Hertog, a scholar on Saudi Arabia at the London School of Economics. ""Larger and lumpier equity injections, potentially of the type giving the PIF a board seat, will be particularly difficult.""
Some firms are already distancing themselves, but sums involved are relatively small compared with the $250 billion PIF has invested.
British billionaire Richard Branson said earlier this month his Virgin Group would suspend its discussions with PIF over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures. A Virgin Group spokesman told Reuters his statement still stands.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday the firm was awaiting the full facts on the murder before deciding whether this would affect the PIF's $3.5 billion investment in the ride-hailing service.
PIF officials did not respond to requests for comment.
TOO BIG TO IGNORE
PIF has shown no signs of changing its strategy. Managing Director Yasir al-Rumayyan told an investment forum this week that PIF holds almost 10 percent of its assets internationally and aims to raise that to 50 percent by 2030. 
It has invested in 50 or 60 firms via SoftBank Group's Vision Fund and will bring most of those firms to the kingdom, he said.
Softbank walked a fine line at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh which was boycotted by dozens of Western officials, bank chiefs and company executives. 
Chief executive Son, whose $93 billion Vision Fund drew nearly half its money from Saudi Arabia, canceled a speaking engagement but other Softbank executives joined panels.
Son came to Riyadh to meet high-ranking Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed, to explain in person why he could not attend the forum and express concern over Khashoggi's death, one source familiar with the matter said.
Dozens of tech firms and private equity or investment companies interested in technology attended, including some U.S. firms. Privately, some said they expected outrage over Khashoggi to fade and business to return largely to normal in a few months. 
Luca Verre, co-founder and chief executive of Prophesee, a young Paris-based company working on advanced machine vision systems, said he came to meet potential investors.
    Verre said he understood the position of tech firms that opted to stay away and that Riyadh needed to do more to clarify responsibility for Khashoggi's killing. But he said PIF remained important for companies like his.
    ""You need investors like PIF that look for long-term game-changers. The commitment of PIF investments around strategic fields such as aerospace, security, IT, smart cities, autonomous vehicles etc is very relevant to what Prophesee is doing.""
Electric car maker Lucid, which snagged a $1 billion PIF investment in September, had a stand at the venue as did Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Siemens. But none sent their top executives.
""Participation at the FII screws up perception in the U.S. and Europe. Withdrawal screws us up here (in Riyadh). The middle ground is lowering our profile,"" said an executive at another company, speaking on the condition the firm not be named.
DOMESTIC PROJECTS
Even before the political crisis, PIF's international ambitions were at risk of being sidetracked by a need to bankroll domestic projects under an economic reform drive.
The fund's three major projects - the NEOM mega city, a Red Sea tourism project, and the Qiddiya entertainment district - were announced last year, but financing plans remain a mystery.
Chief executives of all three said at the forum they were moving ahead, but did not reveal any investors or offer details on how they might be funded.
Saudi authorities have estimated NEOM will cost $500 billion, while estimates have not been released for Qiddiya or the Red Sea Project.
The projects lost their only foreign partner when Branson suspended his directorships over the Khashoggi case. NEOM's advisory board also lost members including Y Combinator's Sam Altman and former U.S. energy secretary Ernest Moniz.
International goals might be tested further if the kingdom faces prolonged pressure over the crisis which has strained its ties with Western allies, including the United States. 
The PIF may look eastwards for investments depending on how the crisis plays out in the U.S. Congress, said a Gulf-based banker.
Rachel Ziemba, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, believed targets in Asia, Russia, the Mideast and North Africa would remain receptive to inward investment. ""But I expect more scrutiny,"" she said.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>","Tesla third-quarter profit quiets critics, shares surge","By Jasmine I S
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares jumped on Thursday as Wall Street analysts said the company had turned a corner with profitable third quarter results and might not now need to raise outside capital.
Rising 12 percent at one point in early trading, the move in shares added as much as $6 billion to Tesla's market value, capping a tumultuous few months for the company and its billionaire chief executive, Elon Musk. 
Tesla shares hit a record in August but sank back as Musk was sued by short-sellers and U.S. regulators for tweeting, and then swiftly abandoning, a plan to take the company private. 
Wall Street analysts have been saying for months that the company would need to raise more money to sustain a ramp up of production of the crucial Model 3 sedan, but several said on Thursday that might no longer be necessary.
""Simply put, deliveries and earnings are the only battles that matter,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst with well-known tech venture capital firm Loup Ventures. 
""It will go on for years, but every time Musk and Tesla beat expectations, they win another battle in that war. Profitability is improving at a rate where the company is on track to generate enough cash to meet its $1.7 billion debt obligations.""
Tesla reported free cash flow of $881 million in the quarter - the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2016 - and Musk said the company will maintain that in the coming quarters.
Musk has been saying since May that Tesla does not plan to raise equity or debt.
""Assuming R&D spending is not delayed and Tesla is not forced to introduce a lower price (Model 3) prematurely to maintain volume, Tesla could be self-funded,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a client note.
""The Tesla investment case is about growth, not free cash generation, so we expect cash to be invested in growth and support current leverage if Tesla demonstrates sustainably positive free cash flow,"" they said.
The yield on Tesla's $1.8 billion high-yield bond due in August 2025 < 88160RAE1=> dropped to a two-month low as the debt rallied off the quarterly results. Since Monday, the yield on the bond, which sports a 5.3 percent coupon, has dropped more than 90 basis points to 7.49 percent from 8.40 percent.
Tesla reported profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, a year earlier.
Musk's penchant for courting controversy with his erratic tweets had put intense pressure on Tesla to convince Wall Street that the company could produce Model 3 cars in a cost-efficient manner and turn a profit.
Some analysts, however, believe Musk may be driving profits by selling only high-end, high-margin Model 3s and those profits may not be sustainable.
""We believe Tesla is exhausting its high-end backlog to fuel near-term profitability and we have concerns around demand in 1H19,"" UBS analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote.
Other analysts believe that Tesla has indeed turned a corner and is on a growth path.
""We believe the TSLA narrative is starting to change as the company transitions to becoming sustainably profitable,"" Baird Research analyst Ben Kallo said.
That was the same sentiment showed by Tesla's long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research, when it said earlier this week that it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric automaker's stock will rise.
At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Of the 29 brokerages covering the stock, 10 have a ""buy"" or higher rating, nine on hold and 10 have a ""sell"" or lower.

The median price target was $316. Shares were last trading up 7.2 percent at $309.80.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>",Belgium picks Lockheed's F-35 over Eurofighter on price,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium said on Thursday it had chosen Lockheed Martin's (N:LMT) F-35 stealth jets over the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging F-16s in a 4 billion euro ($4.55 billion) deal, saying the decision came down to price.
After months of deliberation, the decision to buy 34 of the planes was announced at a government news conference.
Belgium joins a list of other European NATO allies, including Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey, to take the American-made plane, which is also set to be the U.S. military's main fighter aircraft for decades to come.
""We have landed! This government is investing heavily in defense. With the purchase of F-35A fighter planes ... we ensure your safety and that of our military,"" Belgian Defence Minister Steven Vandeput said on Twitter during the news conference.
""The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven evaluation criteria,"" he later told reporters.
The jets, which can avoid detection and tracking by enemy radars or heat sensors, aim to offer NATO allies technological superiority with additional capabilities such as the ability to disrupt enemy communications networks and navigation signals.
The pick makes Belgium the 12th country to choose the F-35, which comes in three variants - the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model, the F-35B, a short take-off or vertical landing version, and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.
Belgium has chosen the conventional version of the plane, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2023.
Vice Admiral Mat Winter, U.S. F-35 program chief, said the decision would further strengthen ties between the United States and Belgium and make it easier for the two countries' air forces to work together on future missions.
The decision is a setback for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, who are behind the Eurofighter program, and also means the rejection of an informal French offer to sell Belgium the Rafale fighter built by Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD).
However, Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) is also a partner on the F-35 project.
Belgium's decision raises the stakes for Eurofighter in Germany, Switzerland and Finland, which also plan to buy new warplanes, industry executives said.
Eurofighter also sees good prospects in Canada, which was part of the initial F-35 partnership, but has not made a decision to buy the U.S. aircraft. Exact terms of the Canadian competition are due to be released next year.
CHEAPER THAN PROJECTED
Prime Minister Charles Michel's government said despite a strong desire to support European allies, the F-35 was cheaper for Belgium over the long term, coming in 600 million euros ($684 million) under what the government budgeted for.
The total price of the deal, including the jets, pilot training, hangars and upkeep until 2030 was worth 4 billion euros, Vandeput said, compared with the original budget of 4.6 billion euros.
Over the 40-year life of the aircraft, the deal will cost Belgium 12.4 billion euros, rather than the 15 billion euros first projected, he said.
Belgium looks to have benefited from Lockheed Martin's strategy to reduce the cost of the jets as production has increased. U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns.
Each plane is likely to cost Belgium around 76 million euros, slightly less than the amount paid by the Netherlands and Italy, according to Belgian newspaper Le Soir, citing a closed-door briefing by Belgian air force personnel to lawmakers on Wednesday, when the final decision was taken.
Michel also defended the decision to choose a U.S. company over European neighbors as a way to balance loyalties to the American-led NATO alliance and defense spending in Europe.
""We are choosing cooperation with NATO and for European defense,"" Michel told the news conference. He said money saved on the F-35 would be used for other defense projects.
With defense spending just under 0.9 percent of economic output on defense in 2017, Belgium is one of the worst performers in trying to meet a NATO target of 2 percent by 2024, which Trump says is already too low and should be at least 3 percent.
Deputy Prime Minister Kris Peeters said 30 percent of the components for the F-35 will also come from Europe.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) led the charge higher for semis, rising about 4%, ahead of its third-quarter report due after market close.
Intel received a lift ahead of its report after Nomura on Monday raised Intel to buy from neutral and upgraded its price target on the stock to $50 on the back of interim CEO Bob Swan's pledge to prioritize the production of Intel Xeon and Core processors, a move which ""bodes well for earnings and gross margin,"" Nomura said.
Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell about 17%, but remained above its session lows after its above-forecast third-quarter earnings were overshadowed by fourth-quarter revenue guidance that fell short consensus estimates.

1382,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>","China's $640 Billion Share-Pledge Risk Looms Over Banks, Brokers","(Bloomberg) -- China’s brokers and banks account for more than half the exposure to loans backed by company shares, a key source of risk as the country’s stock market keeps sliding.
About 4.45 trillion yuan ($640 billion) of shares were pledged as collateral in China’s $5.4 trillion equity market as of Oct. 18, according to Chengdu-based research firm PY Standard. Banks and securities firms have extended more than half of that debt. If stock values continue falling, lenders may be forced to offload more shares, perpetuating a vicious spiral.
“If the lenders force the sale of a large amount of collateral to protect themselves, that’s bound to aggravate market risks,” PY’s analysts wrote in a report published Thursday.
Forced selling is adding to the list of issues facing investors in China, from worsening trade ties with the U.S. to concerns about slowing domestic demand and a slumping yuan. The Shanghai Composite Index is among the world’s worst-performing benchmarks this year, and at least 38 companies have seen pledged shares liquidated by brokerages since the start of June, according to filings.
As China’s stock rout has worsened in October, attention has turned to companies that have a high proportion of shares pledged for loans, as well as their creditors. Denied credit by mainstream banks amid a deleveraging campaign, private companies were forced to find other ways to obtain capital; S&P Global Ratings estimates about 87 percent of stock-backed loans were issued to non-state firms.
Authorities are aware of the dangers, with a slew of measures announced in recent weeks. President Xi Jinping this month vowed “unwavering” support for the private sector.
Equity at risk of forced selling has swelled to more than 10 percent of total market value from what Moody’s Investors Service estimates was 2 percent in 2015. The ratio could increase in 2019, CLSA analysts Alexious Lee and Cara Liu predict.
Yet, they don’t see a “crisis” next year as CLSA predicts authorities’ steps will ease debt default risks and improve liquidity. Given that the private sector accounts for the majority of Chinese output, CLSA says the government will announce “real concrete measures” in November to support the economy and financial sector, before top leadership meets the following month and parliament convenes in March.
“The market is digesting the pledged share margin calls, but the risks should be contained,” the CLSA analysts said in the note.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 12:48PM ET</span>",Twitter shares hit biggest one-day gain as ad sales surge,"By Angela Moon and Munsif Vengattil
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) shares jumped as much as 22 percent on Thursday, putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain, as the social media company easily beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates by selling more ads even though it lost users after purging millions of fake accounts. 
The surge in shares reversed a 19 percent fall three months ago when Twitter shocked Wall Street with a similar decline in users. This time, investors welcomed Twitter removing accounts used for disinformation, hate speech and other abuse as the best way to solidify a base of high-quality users who are attractive to advertisers.
""If they are getting rid of bots, fake accounts and fighting hate speech, then it's actually good for the health of the platform overall,” said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. ""That is certainly more appealing to advertisers.""
Twitter's advertising revenue jumped 29 percent to $650 million in the third quarter from a year earlier, boosted by ad sales on broadcasts from media companies including Live Nation Entertainment, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.
That contributed to a similar jump in overall revenue from a year earlier to $758 million, beating analysts' average estimate of $702.6 million, according to Refinitiv data. 
The company reported adjusted profit of 21 cents per share, well above the average estimate of 14 cents.
TWEET PURGE
Twitter has deleted millions of suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections. Last week it disclosed it had removed some 10 million tweets that it thought were the work of Russian and Iranian government-backed influence operations.
Twitter said in a conference call on Thursday that the cleanup effort, which it launched in March and calls a ""health"" initiative, will allow it to grow revenue faster than users for a sustained period.
""Health ultimately is a growth factor for the service, and we do believe that's important not just for the overall experience, but in terms of making Twitter long-term enduring as well,"" Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said during the call.
Neither Dorsey nor Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal clearly answered questions from analysts on a call after the results on how Twitter would ultimately reverse the decline users. 
Monthly active users (MAUs) fell to 326 million in the third quarter, below the average analyst forecast of 331.5 million, according to FactSet. Twitter said it expects them to fall below 326 million in the current quarter, missing the average forecast of 333.4 million. 
Twitter usage has been stagnant for more than a year, causing some analysts to worry that growth has peaked.
Twitter ""did a superb job of explaining the monthly active user decline, which buys them time, but the stock will come under pressure if MAUs don’t start to grow again in 2019,"" said Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities.
AD GAINS 
Those concerns have been somewhat offset by increases in advertising sales from video which suggest the company is succeeding in efforts to generate more cash from each user and investors have been looking for solid evidence that it would lead to sustainable growth in revenue and profits. 
“Twitter continues to ‘do a lot with a little.’ User growth is lackluster, but the company is eking out more from current users,"" said Jim Cridlin, global head of innovation at WPP's Mindshare media buying agency. 
Distribution deals with U.S. Major League Baseball, video game publisher Activision, Sony Music and Vice are starting to lure advertisers to Twitter’s live premium video, he said.
Twitter said the number of its daily active users rose by 9 percent year-on-year, weaker than an 11 percent jump in the previous quarter and its slowest growth rate in two years. The company does not disclose the total number of daily users.
Twitter shares were up 17 percent at $32.05 in morning trade. They are still down about 42 percent from their 3-1/2 year high of $47.79, hit in June.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc sees the chance to take advantage of the recent U.S. stock market plunge to make acquisitions, co-President and co-Chief Operating Officer Scott Nuttall said on Thursday. 
This week's stock market sell-off follows a sustained period of high valuations, which many private equity executives have complained make it harder to find companies to buy. KKR is sitting on almost $60 billion it has yet to invest. 
""Our teams have been waiting for a valuation adjustment to make some assets that they really like more attractive,"" Nuttall said in an investor call for KKR's third-quarter earnings. 
""The presiding emotion here is excitement that valuations have started maybe in the U.S. to come down a bit,"" Nuttall added. 
Last year, private equity deal valuations in North America were at record-high levels, according to Hamilton Lane's market overview. In the high-price environment, KKR this year has made two of its biggest acquisitions in the last 10 years with Envision Healthcare Corp and business software company BMC Software.
In third-quarter earnings, KKR reported its second-highest distributable earnings (DE) in its history, as results were buoyed by the sale of the divestment of its stake in payments processor First Data Corp and the sale of Finish healthcare company Mehilainen. 
After-tax DE - the actual cash available for paying dividends - totaled $496.7 million for the three months to end-September, up 21.3 percent year over year, KKR said. 
KKR rival Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP reported a similar 22.8 percent year-over-year rise in third-quarter DE last week.
KKR said DE per share came in at 60 cents, slightly ahead of analyst consensus for 59 cents. 
KKR shares were up around 4 percent in mid-morning trade in New York, outpacing the broader market. 
KKR said earlier this year it considers DE as its primary earnings metric, as opposed to economic net income, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation of gains or losses of private equity firms' holdings and is a closely watched measure of performance at peers. 
This focus on DE is part of the firm's efforts to make its stock more accessible to investors, a push which included converting to a corporation from a publicly traded partnership on July 1.

KKR's assets under management grew to $194.6 billion, up 27 percent over the last 12 months. Over the same period, Blackstone's assets under management rose 18 percent to $456.7 billion.

The No. 1 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic maintained its full-year guidance and forecast an additional $1 billion in revenue next year as improvements in aircraft, onboard technology and food offerings take effect.
Its shares rose 4 percent to $31.54 in morning trading. 
They are still down 35 percent in the past 12 months, as American has struggled to grow revenue at the rate of rivals Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL).
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company said it is targeting a pre-tax margin, excluding special items, between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter. That suggests earnings above Wall Street's expectations, analysts said. 
The carrier forecast unit revenue, a closely watched performance measure that compares sales to flight capacity, to rise between 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
""Unit revenue guidance has been consistently ahead of expectations this earnings season as the industry is seeing good demand and improved yields due in part to strong close-in bookings,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen.
STORMS FORCE CANCELLATIONS 
In the third quarter, American's profit halved, in line with Wall Street estimates, hurt by higher fuel costs and the impact of Hurricane Florence that forced it to cancel about 2,100 flights in September.
The company said it would cut capacity, cancel loss-making routes and delay taking delivery of new aircraft to cut costs, but stuck to its full-year profit forecast of $4.50 to $5.00 per share.
Its fuel cost rose 42 percent during the quarter. Worries about its impact on margins have hurt shares of American and rivals, including Delta and Southwest. 
Hurricane Florence slammed North and South Carolina in mid-September, impacting several businesses and forcing airline, delivery, auto and steel companies to shut operations.
The company's net income fell $341 million, or 74 cents per share, in third quarter ended Sept.30 compared with $661 million, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the airlines earned $1.13 per share, in line with analysts' expectations. Operating revenue rose 3.7 percent to $11.64 billion.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Merck, Bristol-Myers profits rise on cancer drug sales","By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) posted better-than-expected third quarter profit and raised their 2018 earnings forecasts on Thursday due to strong demand for their rival cancer immuno-oncology treatments.
But shares of both U.S. drugmakers fell as investors worry about a plan the Trump administration is expected to unveil on Thursday aimed at lowering prices the government's Medicare healthcare program pays for specialty drugs like cancer treatments.
Bristol-Myers pioneered cancer immunotherapy with Yervoy and later its blockbuster drug Opdivo. But Merck & Co's (N:MRK) rival treatment Keytruda has seized a dominant position in lung cancer - the most lucrative oncology market - and Bristol-Myers' shares have suffered.
Keytruda sales exceeded those for Opdivo for the second straight quarter. It has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancers, and has become the leader in both new patient starts and total patient volume. 
Keytruda sales rose more than 80 percent to $1.89 billion for the quarter, slightly beating analyst estimates. Bristol's Opdivo had sales of $1.79 billion, beating analyst estimates by around $100 million.
Yervoy also performed better than expected with sales of $382 million in the quarter.
Bristol-Myers shares were down 2.4 percent at $47.68 in early trading, while Merck shares fell 2.5 percent to $68.80. Bristol-Myers' shares had been down 20 percent so far this year, while Merck's shares were up 25 percent, as each new clinical success for Keytruda weighed on Bristol shares.
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said the expected announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump ""is a direct shot against the immuno-oncology players.""
MERCK TO BUYBACK SHARES, RAISE DIVIDEND
Merck reported adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 4.5 percent to $10.79 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations of $10.88 billion.
The company also announced a $10 billion share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent.
""Expectations were high coming into the quarter, but we think these results should still be well received and allow for continued confidence,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said in a note.
Merck said it plans to spend $16 billion on capital projects through 2022, up from its previous projection of $12 billion, to increase manufacturing capacity in oncology, vaccines and animal health.
""We are confident in our future growth prospects,"" said Merck Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, who will remain in the role beyond 2019 after the company scrapped its mandatory retirement age.
    Merck also saw strong growth from Gardasil, its vaccine to prevent HPV-related cancers. Gardasil sales grew 55 percent to $1.05 billion, helped by increased demand in China and Australia, and its growth should be helped by recently expanded U.S. approval to treat people up to age 45. 
Bristol-Myers' said it earned $1.09 a share, excluding special items, topping analysts' average expectations by 18 cents.
Revenue rose 8 percent to $5.69 billion, just shy of Wall Street estimates of $5.72 billion.
Sales of blood clot preventer Eliquis, which Bristol shares with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), rose 28 percent from last year to $1.58 billion, but fell short of analyst expectations of $1.67 billion. 
Bristol-Myers' effective tax rate was 11.8 percent in the quarter. It now expects a full-year adjusted tax rate of 17 percent, at the bottom end of its previous forecast.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>","AB InBev told Indian authorities about cartel, triggering anti-trust probe","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian anti-trust probe into beer price-fixing allegations was initiated after the world's largest brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  told the authorities last year it had detected an industry cartel, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
AB InBev (BR:ABI) discovered the Indian operations it acquired as part of its around $100 billion acquisition of London-listed rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc in 2016 had for years fixed beer prices along with Denmark's Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) and India's  United Breweries  (NS:UBBW), which is part-owned by  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN), the sources said.
AB InBev conducted an internal investigation in the first half of last year, after closing the SABMiller deal, and found that executives had discussed and agreed on their submission of ex-brewery beer production prices to Indian state governments. Those ex-brewery prices would include all the production and marketing costs, as well as a proposed profit margin, and were used by state governments to set a maximum retail price.
""It was startling,"" one of the sources said. ""Extensive pricing information about the competition, some of which is extremely confidential, was available to all the three companies.""
Earlier this month the Competition Commission of India (CCI) raided the offices of all the three brewers and found e-mails that showed executives were allegedly violating Indian anti-trust laws, Reuters has previously reported.
According to the three sources, those raids came after AB InBev approached the anti-trust watchdog to make disclosures under a so-called ""leniency programme"" that provides a whistleblower-type protection for cartel members disclosing wrongdoing.
Sudhir Mittal, chairman of the CCI, did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for AB InBev, whose Indian offerings include Budweiser and Corona, said ""it would not be appropriate for us to comment"" for this article. Carlsberg, which sells beer under its own-name brand and also owns Tuborg, said it was ""committed to complying"" with all relevant laws.
United Breweries, which commands a 51 percent share of the Indian market and sells the  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) and Heineken beer brands in India, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Heineken declined to comment.
Calls to Shalabh Seth, the managing director of SABMiller in India at the time of the AB InBev acquisition, went unanswered. He now works for United Breweries.
After Reuters reported the CCI raids on Oct. 11, United Breweries told the Indian stock exchanges the company took its compliance obligations seriously and was reviewing its legal risks and potential implications.
Belgium-based AB InBev has said it takes anti-trust compliance ""very seriously"".
The three brewers, who according to Euromonitor International account for 90 percent of beer consumption in the $7 billion India market, together face a potential fine of up to $272 million if they are found to have operated a cartel, the sources said. Any company executives found to have fixed prices could also be fined.
AB InBev could escape some or all of its share of the fines for self-reporting the issue.
It was unclear how much the alleged price-fixing may have cost consumers.
HIGHLY-REGULATED MARKET
The investigation will cast a further shadow on an Indian beer business that already faces stringent compliance and state-level regulation, making it tougher for brewers to expand.
Though a young and affluent population, better social acceptance towards drinking and a growing pub culture have spurred beer consumption, many Indian drinkers still prefer potent spirits, particularly whisky, especially in smaller towns and villages.
Most states individually regulate alcohol pricing and the companies need to submit and get prices approved every year by the local authorities. There are also separate labeling, licensing and brand registration norms.
The ex-brewery prices set by the companies are also the base on which alcohol taxes, a vital source of state government revenue, are imposed.
That results in wild variations in retail prices. A 330 ml bottle of Kingfisher costs 36 rupees (49 cents) in the tourist state of Goa, but 130 rupees ($1.77) in the northern state of Haryana, a major industrial hub, according to India's largest beer chain, the Beer Cafe.
RARE DAWN RAIDS
As part of its investigation, the CCI secured permission from a Delhi district judge to conduct search and seizure operations at the brewers' offices, only the third such raids in the watchdog's near 10-year history.
The dawn raids were conducted in two Indian cities - Bengaluru, previously known as Bangalore, in southern India and Gurugram, near the capital New Delhi - by dozens of officers and technology experts, five sources with knowledge of the probe said.
Over two days, senior company officials were questioned about pricing, their computer hard-disks copied and mobile phones cloned to analyze communications over WhatsApp.
One source gave an example of an e-mail that showed the companies were exchanging notes on their successes on achieving better prices in a particular state, and how that model can be replicated. The source described the communication as a ""brazen"" anti-trust violation.
Reuters has not been able to independently verify the contents of any e-mails.
The watchdog suspects price-fixing in at least four Indian states, one of the sources said. The CCI's investigation unit will further question company executives and analyze the seized evidence before making penalty recommendations in a report, which will be reviewed by commission members in a process that could take up to 12 months.
The Indian probe is the latest anti-trust headache for global brewers. Last year, the European Commission accused AB InBev of abusing its market dominance in Belgium by impeding the flow of cheaper imports into the country. In 2014, a German regulator fined Carlsberg and smaller brewers for colluding on prices. 
""BAFFLING"" MARKET
The brewers are already facing an uphill struggle in India.
An executive who has formerly worked for a foreign brewer in India said local governments were reluctant to allow price increases, fearing they would impact consumer purchases and, in turn, their tax revenues.
""There is nobody making margins here other than the governments, they want to maximize their revenue,"" the executive said.
Beyond pricing issues, sudden policy changes can also hit brewers. In 2016, India's Supreme Court banned liquor sales within 500 meters of highways and the same year the eastern state of Bihar banned alcohol.
Three other Indian states and one federally-controlled island territory also ban or restrict alcohol sales.
For Carlsberg, the Bihar state ban came just two years after the company opened a new brewery there. At the time, its then country head, Michael Jensen, said India was the ""most difficult market in the world but you can't do stuff like that ... It is very detrimental for investor confidence"".
Top brewers also face a challenge from the growing popularity of premium segment craft beers. Sequoia Capital-backed B9 Beverages' ""Bira 91"" brand and a start-up brand ""Simba"" have lured drinkers with quirky branding and lighter brews.
Simba clocked sales of $10.2 million last year and is targeting a doubling this year, but could have grown at a faster pace if not for the stringent and varied state government regulations, its founder Prabhtej Singh Bhatia told Reuters.
Bhatia said his working capital requirements have often been strained by varied state policies - in Goa, for example, he said registration of a new beer brand costs $328, compared with $20,500 in Delhi.
""The market is very challenging, it's baffling,"" Bhatia said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (T:6502) is considering liquidating its British nuclear unit NuGen, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday, leaving Britain to seek alternatives for a project that was meant to provide 7 percent of the country's electricity.
The move comes as Toshiba believes talks to sell the unit have dragged on too long, the sources told Reuters.
""Toshiba is eager to shut off potential risks associated with NuGen soon,"" one of them said. Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are private. 
Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants, especially nuclear have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices.
The NuGen project in Moorside, northwest England, faced setbacks after Toshiba's nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year.
Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (KS:015760) was initially the preferred bidder, but lost that status in July. 
Toshiba then negotiated with Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa), but the talks fell through, one of the sources said. 
The Japanese conglomerate is still in discussions with KEPCO, but as prospects for the talks are unclear Toshiba has decided to consider liquidating NuGen, one of the sources said.
When contacted by Reuters, Toshiba said in a statement it ""continues to consider additional options including sale of its shares in NuGen to KEPCO.""
""We are carefully monitoring the situation, in consultation with stakeholders including the UK government,"" it added.
A KEPCO spokesman said the company is not aware of Toshiba's plan to liquidate NuGen.
Toshiba has already written down the value of NuGen's assets, but has been constantly injecting cash in order to keep the project running.
Operations at the project have already been scaled down, and the headcount at the project was slashed last month to fewer than 40 people.
A spokesman for NuGen said: ""There is a limited window of time, and the wind-up of NuGen, and the Moorside Project remains a very real prospect with Toshiba indicating clearly its intention to withdraw from the project by the end of the financial year.""
""Everything is being done by the teams at NuGen and Toshiba to minimize that prospect, to enable Toshiba to achieve a clean exit, and to enable NuGen and the Moorside Project to continue,” the spokesman said.

The second largest U.S. automaker said it is calling back 2012 through 2018 model year Ford Focus cars with 2.0-liter GDI and 2.0-liter GTDI engines for a malfunctioning valve that could result in inaccurate fuel level readings and potentially engine stalls or an inability to restart the vehicle.

Shares were up more than 3% early Thursday after the tech giant said it earned $1.14 a share on revenue of $29.1 billion, beating both the $0.95 and $27.92 billion that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were anticipating.
And while sales from its Azure cloud-computing unit grew 76% versus a year ago, that was a bit below the 89% pace experienced in the fourth quarter.
""A strong quarter (even after adj for demand pull forward) and a F2Q19 guide that brackets consensus,"" a team of RBC analysts led by Ross MacMillan wrote in a note to clients after the results were released on Wednesday.
""Although comps get tougher in F2H19 (especially on gross margins) we continue to see many sustainable growth drivers."" The team reiterated its $124 price target and ""outperform"" rating. 
Microsoft shares had gained 19.5% this year through Wednesday, but were down more than 12% from their October record high of $116.18."

Shares of the electric-car maker were up more than 10%, trading at their highest level in about two months.
After Wednesday's close, Tesla reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 a share on revenue of $6.8 billion, better than the $0.15-a-share loss and $6.3 billion that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.
""Q3 2018 was a truly historic quarter for Tesla,""  the company said in a press release. ""Model 3 was the best-selling car in the US in terms of revenue and the 5th best-selling car in terms of volume.""
The company said free cash flow was $881 million for the quarter, while its total long-term debt increased slightly, to $9.67 billion.
This year has been a roller-coaster ride for Tesla shareholders. The stock topped out above $387 a share on August 7, the day CEO Elon Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Musk didn't have funding secured, and he later settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused him of misleading the public. As part of the settlement, he agreed to step down as chairman for at least three years and pay a fine of $20 million.
But the damage had been done to Tesla's stock, which fell near the key support level of $250. The stock has managed to hold there, and it looks as if the bulls have reclaimed the upper hand — at least for the time being.
Tesla was down 7% this year through Wednesday."
1429,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 09:03AM ET</span>",High-speed data boom drives Comcast profit beat,"By Akanksha Rana and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) quarterly profit and revenue topped Wall Street estimates on Thursday as it attracted more customers to its high-speed internet connections, offsetting a drop in cable TV subscribers that was also less severe than expected.
The show of continued momentum in the third quarter comes after the media conglomerate beat Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) to buy satellite TV broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB) for $40 billion in a sealed-bid auction in September.
Executives are expected to take a victory lap and spend an extra half hour on Thursday morning to introduce Sky Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Darroch to Wall Street analysts on a conference call.
Shares of the company rose 3.3 percent to $35.25 in trading before the bell.
The results showed revenue from high-speed internet rose 9.6 percent to $4.32 billion in the quarter as the company added 363,000 internet subscribers, beating an average estimate of 294,000, according to research firm FactSet. 
Comcast said it was the best performance for the division in ten years.
Comcast also said in October its fastest-speed gigabit internet service reached more homes than any other provider in the United States after it completed a rollout to nearly all of the 58 million homes and businesses it serves. 
The biggest U.S. cable provider said it lost 106,000 video customers, down from the 125,000 customers it lost in the same quarter last year, as some TV viewers dropped pricey cable bills for cheaper streaming options like AT&T Inc's (N:T) newly-launched WatchTV or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 
Wall Street had expected a steeper decline of 152,000, according to FactSet. Revenue from its video segment fell nearly 3 percent to $5.59 billion. 
Net income attributable to Comcast rose 9.2 percent to $2.89 billion, or 62 cents per share, from $2.64 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 65 cents. Analysts were expecting the company to earn 61 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Philadelphia-based Comcast's revenue grew 5 percent to $22.14 billion, above the average estimate of $21.82 billion.
Comcast added 228,000 Xfinity Mobile customers in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The wireless service was launched last year and is available only to Comcast internet subscribers.
The company's total capital expenditures were down about 2 percent to $2.38 billion.
Revenue from the company's NBCUniversal segment rose 8.1 percent to $8.63 billion.

However, revenue from theme parks fell 1.4 percent to $1.53 billion due to weather-related disruptions and natural disasters in Japan.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 08:51AM ET</span>","ConocoPhillips tops profit estimates, raises 2018 spending","(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP) quarterly profit topped analysts' estimates on Thursday, as the world's largest independent oil and gas producer turned more cost efficient by deploying better technology and selling some assets besides benefiting from higher oil prices. 
Those measures also helped the Houston-based company raise its 2018 capital expenditure forecast for the second time this year.
Chief Executive Ryan Lance said the company would keep its focus on free cash flow to ensure better shareholder returns. ""This is what the market can expect from us again in 2019.""
The results and CEO comment sent shares up a percent in pre market trading.
Conoco is one of the first major U.S. oil producers to report third-quarter results and often an indicator of the sector's performance. The company said it now expects to spend $6.1 billion this year, up from its July forecast of $6 billion.
U.S. oil producers have been under pressure from investors to produce more oil at lower costs. But with oil prices steadily rising, Conoco's higher capital expenditure indicated that companies can now afford to spend more.
Brent crude prices (LCOc1) touched nearly $85 earlier this month and is expected to hit the $100 mark by the end of 2018, as U.S. sanctions on Iran remove a major supplier from the global markets.
Conoco sold each barrel oil equivalents at a 46 percent higher rate in the quarter and saw production go up by nearly 2 percent.
The company said net income rose to $1.9 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $420 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.
During the quarter, the company earned $345 million related to a settlement agreement with Venezuela's PDVSA. 
The proceeds were part of a first installment under a deal to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award Conoco won earlier this year over broken oil contracts in the South American country more than a decade ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.36 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.18 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's global output, excluding Libya, rose 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) to 1.22 million boe/d, helped by higher output from Europe and Alaska.

Conoco is set to host a conference call later in the day to discuss details of results.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top financial market index providers should reconsider their recent decisions to add Saudi Arabia to emerging markets products, New York City's chief pension fund official said on Wednesday, citing ""disturbing allegations"" about the kingdom after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In letters to three major index providers sent on Wednesday and seen by Reuters, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer wrote he was concerned that keeping the country in the indexes would expose his funds and others to unsuitable investments.
""Saudi Arabia has demonstrated a disdain for the rule of law and international norms of due process and human rights,"" creating risks for investors, he wrote.
Spokespeople for the three index providers who received the letters,  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI), FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices all declined to comment.
Stringer oversees New York City's roughly $195 billion public pension system, one of the largest in the U.S. His call marked only the latest move among Western political and financial leaders to distance themselves from Saudi Arabia after the journalist's death sparked global condemnation.
On Wednesday Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed Khashoggi's killers would be brought to justice, in his first public comments about the matter.
Exclusion from the indexes would mark a setback for Saudi Arabia after the world's top oil producer was upgraded since March by each of the three well-known index providers on the strength of market reforms spearheaded by the ruler widely known as MbS.
The Saudi Stock Exchange had said in September it expected a heavy inflow of foreign money in 2019 - perhaps $20 billion or more - as it joins major emerging markets indexes.
A spokesperson for Stringer said the pension system has no direct investments in Saudi companies currently. A public disclosure shows that as of July funds run by his office had $15.5 billion allocated to emerging markets.
Index providers had previously said Saudi Arabia would account for around 2.7 percent of emerging markets index products, which would give the city's funds an exposure to the country of about $420 million.
FTSE Russell is owned by  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) and S&P Dow Jones Indices is part of S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI).

The bank said in a statement that it had hired fintech company Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc to provide the tech tool, which its roughly 7,000 advisers and their staff will use for front- and back-office tasks, like opening client accounts, trade routing and order management and asset servicing.
No financial details were provided.
UBS is the first major client to buy Broadridge's wealth platform. If other firms begin using the technology, the costs of certain services, like regulatory compliance, will be shared by all firms on the platform, said Tim Gokey, Broadridge's president and chief operating officer, in an interview.
The services that will have shared costs are ""things that everybody has to do, and we have to do them in the same way, but they don't differentiate our firm to our clients or advisers,"" said Thomas Giacalone, UBS head of operations for wealth management in the Americas.
By signing on to Broadridge's platform, UBS does not have to invest in building out its own software or manage several third-party providers, said Giacalone.
""Having the best back-office and middle-office technology and being able to moderate those expenses is one of the keys to making us more efficient,"" Giacalone said.
UBS executives last week announced plans to aggressively grow its base of wealthy U.S. clients.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Covering the retirement beat, I often hear this claim: “We’re all living longer.”
It usually precedes arguments for various strategies to help build retirement security in an age of boundless longevity - such as persuading people to save more money or delay filing for Social Security. It also is used to argue that pension, Social Security or Medicare benefits are unaffordable, and should be cut.
Average longevity has indeed risen in the United States but the gains are tapering off, according to the Society of Actuaries (SOA), which this week released its annual “mortality improvement scale,” which pension plan sponsors use to project their future payout obligations. 
It reflects a slight decline in life expectancy compared with 2017 due to growth in three of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States: unintentional injury, Alzheimer’s disease and suicide. All three categories increased significantly from 2015 to 2016, he notes. The new life expectancy for a 65-year-old man fell just over a month, to 85.6 years; for women, the average number fell just under a month, to 87.6 years.
The most significant declines have occurred in middle-aged people, aged 25 to 56, notes Hall. And more broadly, he says the U.S. mortality numbers have been deteriorating since 2010. “The trend toward improving mortality has been much lower in recent years than it was historically,” says Dale Hall, managing director of research for the SOA. 
The question is, why?
The United States is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and we spend more on healthcare per capita than any other country. But life expectancy and gains in health have lagged other high-income countries for years, according to a 2013 report sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and which included a panel of medical experts.
The study notes that the United States does have lower-than-average cancer death rates and better control of blood pressure and cholesterol than peer countries. As a result, if you reach age 75 you can expect to live longer than your counterparts abroad.
LOSING AN OLYMPIC EVENT
But overall, the study found that Americans are faring worse in a wide range of measures, including infant mortality and low birth weight, injuries and homicides, drug-related deaths, obesity and diabetes, heart disease and chronic lung disease. Many of the conditions sharply reduce the odds of reaching age 50 - and for those who do, the conditions contribute to poorer health and greater illness later in life, the report found.
“If health were an Olympic event, we have been getting beat by lots of other nations,” said Stephen Bezruchka, a professor at the School of Public Health of the University of Washington in Seattle.
The poor performance does not stem only from problems with access to healthcare, he notes. “We tend to confuse health and healthcare,” he said, adding that research shows that medical care accounts for no more than 15 percent of the mortality gap between the United States and other rich countries.
Epidemiologists have documented that societies with less economic equality have worse than average health. Some of this stems from the inability of lower-income households to meet basic needs such as adequate nutrition and shelter. But at the high end of wealth, Bezruchka notes, there is a diminishing-return effect - money can purchase only so much health.
“Those with more income do have lower mortality, but you get a greater return on average health by taking a little from the rich and giving it to the poorer person.”
The high rate of childhood poverty in the United States is another important factor driving life expectancy, he said. “Healthier societies privilege early life in various ways. For example, they give mothers or fathers paid time off to raise kids - the U.S. is one of the only major countries in the world that don’t have a nationally mandated paid parental leave.”
A study released earlier this year by the actuaries at the Social Security Administration based on the agency’s massive database on American workers confirmed that lifetime earnings have a profound effect on longevity. [nL1N1S90YW] (https://reut.rs/2R80bZe).
The differences were expressed as mortality ratios. A ratio of 1.00 means death rates for a given group were equal to the group as a whole; ratios lower than that number indicate lower mortality, while a higher number indicates earlier death.
In 2015 retired men aged 62-64 in the highest-income quintile had a ratio of 0.52, while those in the lowest-income quintile had a ratio of 1.77. The comparable figures for women were not much different - 0.73 for the highest-income quintile, and 1.54 for the lowest. 
Proposals to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security or Medicare would be a cruel blow to workers on the wrong side of those numbers. If we are going to achieve more appropriate long-term reforms to these programs it will be important to convince the public that ""No - we are not all living longer."" 
Instead, we should be focusing on this question: why are Americans in poorer health than people in comparable wealthy nations around the world - and what can we do to change that?

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Wednesday it put two executives on leave in connection with ongoing regulatory reviews into the bank’s retail sales practices.
Chief Administration Officer Hope Hardison and Chief Auditor David Julian have begun leaves of absence and will no longer be members of the bank’s operating committee, the bank said. 
The bank declined to comment on the reason for the moves, which it announced in a press release.
Hardison is a 24-year veteran of Wells Fargo and assumed the CAO role in 2015, according to the company website. Julian joined Wells through its merger with Wachovia Corp and has served as chief auditor since 2012, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Wells Fargo has been coping with the fallout of a sales practice scandal since late 2016, when it was revealed that millions of fake accounts may have been opened in customers’ names by bankers facing lofty sales targets. 
Since then the bank has been hit with penalties including a $1 billion fine and a cap on assets put in place by the Federal Reserve.
Earlier this week, the bank settled for $65 million with the New York attorney general’s office which alleged that the bank misled investors about its sales practices.
The fourth-largest U.S. lender is still facing inquiries into its customer sales abuses by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor, according to Wells Fargo’s most recent regulatory disclosure. The bank is also facing several class-action lawsuits from angry customers.

""We remain steadfast in our focus on making things right for customers and building a better Wells Fargo,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said in a statement on Wednesday.

The results come as Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to gain from higher defense spending under President Donald Trump's administration and stronger global demand for fighter jets and tanks.
Sales at Raytheon's missile systems unit, its biggest by revenue, rose 7 percent to about $2.08 billion in the reported quarter.
However, operating margin for the unit — which makes weapons including medium-range air-to-air missiles, Paveway laser-guided bombs and SM-3 anti-ballistic missiles — fell 210 basis points to 12.3 percent.
Sales at the company's intelligence, information and services business, its second biggest, rose 13 percent to $1.74 billion, driven by higher revenue from various programs, including DOMino, which provides cybersecurity support to the U.S Department of Homeland Security.
Operating margin for the unit increased 130 basis points to 8.6 percent.
The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company now expects 2018 earnings from continuing operations to be between $10.01 and $10.11 per share, up from its previous forecast of $9.77 to $9.97 per share.
Raytheon also forecast annual sales between $27 billion and $27.3 billion, higher than its prior expectation of $26.7 billion to $27.2 billion.
Income from continuing operations attributable to the company rose 12.4 percent to $644 million, or $2.25 per share, in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, beating Refinitiv estimates of $1.98.

Overall sales rose 8.3 percent to $6.81 billion, topping estimates of $6.70 billion.

1486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Tesla Profit Blowout Reverses Much of Musk's Damage to Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- Profit secured.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. blew away expectations with just the third quarter of positive earnings in its history, bolstering Elon Musk’s bid to make selling electric cars a financially sustainable business.
The profit and cash that Tesla generated sent its shares surging to levels last seen in mid-August, when the chief executive officer was still in the midst of a short-lived gambit to take the company private. The stock sold off in the intervening months, after Musk’s claim that he had “funding secured” for such a deal proved faulty and landed him in legal jeopardy.
All the while, Tesla was achieving long-awaited breakthroughs to boost production of Model 3 sedans. Buyers -- many of whom had been waiting more than two years to take delivery -- quickly made it one of the top-selling sedans in the U.S.
Tesla is still far from being a full-line automaker, and it’s followed up past quarters of profitability with strings of more losses. It’s still nowhere close to generating revenue and earnings to contend with the likes of Toyota Motor Corp. or BMW AG. But even investors who’ve been among the most vocally bearish about the company have started to change their view as Musk lures away buyers of Camry and 3-Series sedans.
“It is the most encouraging sign of sustainable profitability that we’ve seen in three years,” said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “Tesla did all of this despite the distractions around Elon himself, and the positive report reverses some of the damage that’s been done.”
Tesla reported adjusted net income of $2.90 a share, soundly beating analysts’ average estimate for a small loss. Free cash flow was about $881 million, a turnabout from the billions of dollars Tesla was burning on a quarterly basis while it was struggling to ramp up the Model 3.
The shares advanced 11 percent to $319.39 in European trading as of 11:05 a.m. in Germany. Tesla last close above this level on Aug. 24.
And even as deliveries took off, Tesla managed to maintain more than $900 million in customer deposits, showing that there’s still plenty of pent-up demand for the company’s cars.
Musk capped the quarterly report with a drama-free earnings call, which is far from a given for him. He opened by calling on executives responsible for efforts ranging from artificial intelligence and Autopilot to workplace safety, leaving less time than usual for the question-and-answer session with analysts.
The quarter “marks an inflection point,” said Joe Dennison, associate portfolio manager of Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle. Strong demand for pricier all-wheel-drive and high-performance versions of the Model 3, plus Tesla’s plan to start selling the car in Europe early next year, should support profit margins, he wrote in an email.
The results bode well for the auto industry’s wider rollout of electric vehicles,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said after the German maker of Mercedes-Benz reported results.
“We’re happy that Tesla achieved a good result,” he said. “It’s good for the industry, and we are generally optimistic about our own electric-car strategy.”
Tesla reaffirmed its forecast for profit and positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter, adding credibility to Musk’s prediction a quarter ago that the company will make those feats routine going forward.
The CEO couched those comments in August by saying that “force majeure” events could prove him wrong. One such circumstance the company will have to muddle through in the coming quarters will be trade tensions involving China.
Higher tariffs have hit demand for Model S sedans and Model X crossovers imported into the country. Parts that Tesla sources from China and uses to build all of its vehicles in California are also being hit with higher levies, which will be a $50 million blow to gross profit in the fourth quarter.
Tesla’s CEO remains confident regardless.
“Our earnings profile has flipped dramatically,” Musk and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said in a letter to shareholders. “We can’t thank you enough for your support. We would not have achieved this historic quarter without it.”

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) third-quarter net profit plunged by a shocking two-thirds, hit by a $440 million one-off charge related to U.S. recalls and sending its shares tumbling to near nine-year-lows on Thursday. 
The unexpected costs relating to Hyundai's engine recalls came on the heels of mounting U.S. pressure to respond to reports of vehicles catching fires. 
The recall headache adds to a plethora of issues at Hyundai, which had counted on new SUVs to engineer a recovery following five straight years of annual profit declines stemming from weak sales in its key U.S. and Chinese markets. 
Quarterly net profit slid to 269 billion won ($236 million), the lowest in more than seven years and well below a SmartEstimate of 831 billion won, according to Refinitiv data. SmartEstimates give more weight to recent estimates by analysts who are more consistently accurate.
Operating profit slumped 76 percent while sales rose 1 percent to 24.4 trillion won. 
Shares in the automaker finished down 6 percent, their lowest closing level since March 2010. At one point they fell as much as 12.4 percent, their lowest since January 2010. Shares of affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270), which will report its earnings on Friday, slumped 5.9 percent. 
A U.S. consumer advocate group this month called for an expansion of the engine-related recall, which was announced by the South Korean duo last year, citing a surge in fire complaints.
A U.S. senate committee asked Hyundai and Kia executives to testify at a hearing next month. A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns about engine defects to the U.S. safety regulator, which has subsequently launched a probe into the timeliness of the recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles. 
""Transportation authorities in the U.S. and other countries are taking a more rigorous and detailed look at quality matters than in the past,"" Lee Hyang, head of Global Quality Strategy Division, said during a conference call with analysts. 
""We are continuing company-wide efforts to minimize additional quality problems going forward,"" he added.
The one-off charge will also cover expenses related to new technology aimed at detecting engine defects that will be used in upcoming and some existing models.
""The one-off costs were too big, and the question is whether the costs will be just one-off or whether there will be more to come,"" said Jung Yong-jin, an auto analyst at Shinhan Investment & Securities, adding that he did not expect a meaningful earnings recovery in the near term.
Hyundai also said sharp drops in currencies of emerging markets such as Turkey and Russia weighed on its bottom line.
SANTA FE
Hyundai said escalating trade wars and slowing growth in China and the United States cloud the industry outlook, but predicted its profit would rebound in the fourth quarter, helped by new SUVs. It did not elaborate.
Hyundai had been counting on its new Santa Fe SUV to turn around its flagging fortunes in the United States where it had missed out on a SUV boom due to its heavy reliance on sedans.
But its U.S. retail sales rose only 1 percent in the third quarter. Sales in China declined 6 percent, despite an agreement between Seoul and Beijing last year to normalize ties, putting a diplomatic row that had hit sales of South Korean goods behind them. 
The automaker said Santa Fe sales should increase gradually.
""The initial response for the Santa Fe is positive,"" said Koo Zayong, head of investor relations, adding the model will raise the utilization rate of its U.S. factory to above 90 percent in the fourth quarter from the second-quarter's 86 percent.
Hyundai is also bracing for a decision from the United States as to whether it will slap tariffs on imports of vehicles and vehicle parts.
South Korea has argued it should get tariff exemptions, saying it has already made concessions in the auto sector after a bilateral deal was revised last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) lost a fifth of its market value after downturns at its New York and London creative agencies forced it to cut sales and profit forecasts, showing the scale of the task facing its new boss after founder Martin Sorrell's acrimonious exit.
Mark Read, a softly-spoken veteran of the world's biggest advertising group, said WPP needed to sell assets, hold off acquisitions and bring in new talent at its storied agencies such as JWT, Ogilvy and Y&R, in order to recover. 
WPP's third-quarter downturn, which wiped 2.8 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) off its market value, was all the more startling as it came after decent updates from peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP). 
The results indicated that the high-margin and previously strong media units that buy ad space and plan campaigns were also struggling. 
""We need to have stronger creative agencies,"" Read told Reuters. ""We do have good people, we need more of them. This isn't going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about the speed at which the business is going to turn around."" 
Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising boss, built WPP from a two-man office in central London into the world's most powerful advertising company offering creative work, media buying, pr, consultancy and data analytics. 
The group outperformed for years, helped by Sorrell's ability to buy companies and win pitches, but growth disappeared at the start of 2017 due to competition from consultancies and tech groups Facebook (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL) which enable clients to cut out the middle men and place ads directly.
Sorrell left in April after a complaint about personal misconduct which he denied. He remains a top 10 shareholder and has since set up a new challenger group, S4C. 
""The challenges we've seen in the third quarter reinforce our determination to take more radical action and to move more decisively,"" Read said. 
RADICAL ACTION 
The British group will start by selling a stake in its underperforming data analytics group Kantar, which has been valued at around 3.5 billion pounds by analysts.
That will help to lift overall growth and add to the 16 non-core assets it has already sold, raising 704 million pounds. The efforts will help lower debt from almost 5 billion pounds. 
Sales were particularly weak in North America and the UK for WPP, which lowered its net sales full-year guidance, saying it could fall as much as 1 percent compared with a target of 0.3 percent growth just three months ago. 
The operating margin is likely to be down between 1 and 1.5 margin points, compared with a previous prediction of down 0.4. 
The shares were down 16 percent at 0925, taking them down 34 percent in the year to date and giving WPP a market value of 11.1 billion pounds. 
""WPP has delivered a proper profit warning,"" analysts at Citi said. ""Third quarter organic growth is materially below expectations and having raised guidance at the beginning of September the group has cut it hard today.""
Major WPP clients such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) are facing their own pressures, forcing them to question everything they spend and taking some marketing work in house. 
In recent months WPP has also lost some major pitches, most notably the creative account for Ford to Omnicom's BBDO, which it had previously held for 75 years. 
WPP also said that Finance Director Paul Richardson would step down after 22 years in the role.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",UBS targets American wealth for growth as investment bank shines,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) said it is targeting ultra-rich Americans for growth, as it reported a strong investment banking performance which offset sluggishness in its wealth management business.
Switzerland's biggest bank, which manages the money of half the world's billionaires, said on Thursday it aims to bring in 70 billion Swiss francs ($70 billion) in new inflows from the United States over the next three years. 
With more billionaires hailing from the United States than anywhere else in the world, Swiss money managers have started courting wealthy Americans who might be seeking to invest some of their cash abroad. 
The new targets from UBS come as geopolitical jitters and trade tensions have put pressure on its main business, with its wealth management division suffering from clients trading less. 
But UBS posted a surprise 32 percent rise in overall third-quarter net profit after a 75 percent jump in investment banking pre-tax profit and strong business in the Americas offset modest growth in the wealth management division and flat earnings in its home market and Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
AMERICA'S GOT WEALTH
Facing a highly competitive and largely saturated Swiss wealth management market and sluggish growth prospects in Europe, UBS said it planned to expand in the United States.
It aims for pre-tax profit growth at the upper end of the unit's 10-15 percent target over 2019-2021, while it brings in fresh money at a 2-4 percent annual rate.
""Expansion in the American ultra-high net worth segment alone is expected to contribute significant net new money over the next three years,"" UBS said in a statement.
It also wants to deliver a pre-tax profit margin of 25 percent in the United States by 2021, marking a 900 basis point rise from the 16 percent it posted in the third quarter. 
Wealth management co-heads Martin Blessing and Tom Naratil are scheduled to provide details on the plans at 1300 GMT.
INVESTMENT BANK SHINES
Although UBS again outperformed expectations at its investment bank, analysts and investors have been cautious about welcoming gains in a business seen as more volatile and outside the Zurich-based bank's core focus.
Over the last decade, the bank has scaled back its capital-intensive investment bank to focus more on banking the world's rich. It says the business is essential to fully servicing wealth management clients, focusing on profitable advisory and execution niches that use up less of the balance sheet.
UBS outlined few major changes for its investment bank, after former boss Andrea Orcel left to head Spain's biggest bank Santander (MC:SAN) in September. It is now run by co-heads Piero Novelli and Robert Karofsk, who are scheduled to provide further details shortly after 1500 GMT.
Shares in UBS were up 1.9 percent by 0927 GMT, compared to a 1.4 percent rise in Europe's overall banking sector.

LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) has announced plans to intensify competition with rival  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) ahead of Brexit, saying it would expand a profit-sharing scheme.
The Frankfurt-based exchange's Eurex Clearing said it will expand its ""partnership"" program to include repurchase or repo agreements and foreign exchange traded among banks from the first quarter of 2019.
The more volume that users pass through Eurex, the bigger share of profit they will get. It is similar to a long-standing program at the LSE's LCH unit, which dominates euro-denominated clearing in Europe.
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and Paris are vying to win a share of London's financial market, Europe's biggest, as UK-based financial firms shift some business to new EU hubs ahead of Brexit.
The aim of the repo program is to increase choice and efficiency for market participants in special repo and general collateral instruments, and to grow in the dealer-to-client repo business, Eurex said.
LCH's Paris subsidiary clears repo-related business.
Some EU policymakers want euro-denominated clearing moved from London to the euro zone after Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, London would likely remain a clearing center for EU customers to give rivals like Eurex time to build up capacity, an EU document indicated on Wednesday.
Eurex launched its program a year ago to capture a chunk of LCH's euro interest rate swaps business, though it is still dwarfed by its London counterpart.
The OTC FX market is still largely uncleared, Eurex said.
""Eurex Clearing is currently working with market participants to be the first major clearinghouse to offer a comprehensive cross-currency swap clearing service,"" it said in a statement.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have expressed an early interest to join both new segments, Eurex said, adding that  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), DekaBank and LBBW may participate in the repo program.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia put global stocks firmly on course for their worst month since the financial crisis.
It wasn't a sunny picture by any means. Germany's Dax <.GDAX> hit a near two-year low and London's FTSE (FTSE) and Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) both brushed 1-1/2 year lows early on, but a semblance of stability was emerging. (EU)
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was almost back at level pegging having opened down almost 1 percent and after Japan's Nikkei (N225) had slumped 3.5 percent overnight. (T)
Currency dealers were also cautiously reversing out of Swiss franc  and Japanese yen  safety trades [/FRX] and Italian and Spanish bonds made ground as traders waited to see what message the European Central Bank delivers at its meeting later. [GVD/EUR]
""The markets have been acting like classic flight-to-safety markets,"" said London & Capital's head of fixed income Sanjay Joshi, pointing to the slump in stocks and rally in safer bonds and currencies.
""The worst thing the ECB could do would be to come out with a hawkish statement considering the situation we have at the moment."" 
Most economists expect ECB President Mario Draghi to say the bank will stick to plans to end stimulus this year. But it will be the signal he sends about market volatility and concerns around Italy, his homeland, that could be most crucial. 
Heavyweight investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock prices, faster rate hikes in the United States and an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth.
Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's global equity index (MIWD00000PUS) are now in so-called 'bear market' territory -- down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks. 
More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) skidded more than 2 percent while Japan's Nikkei (N225) tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low.
The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in the black having dropped as much as 2.5 percent at one point (SSEC), as fresh government support measures failed to ease worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the U.S.
""If you're a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.

TALKING TURKEY
Europe's stabilization was aided by results from Swiss bank UBS and engineering giant ABB (S:ABBN) which helped take the edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning from U.S. digger behemoth  Caterpillar  (N:CAT).
The ECB was looming too. Weak euro zone economic data this week have added to angst over world growth, as has a surprise slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing.
It wasn't just the ECB that was being closely watched either. Turkey, which has been stabilizing in recent weeks having been at the center of emerging market troubles was also holding a central bank meeting.
The consensus is that having almost doubled its interest rates already this year to 24 percent, it might be brave enough to hold still this month. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro clawed its way back up to $1.14 (EUR=), having breached a long standing bulwark of $1.1430. 
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a nine-week peak to 96.296 (DXY) and for the first time in days it was barely budged against the safety first Japanese yen at 112.25 yen . [USD/]
Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887 , having dropped 0.8 percent overnight and oil prices began to gain having been dragged down by the concerns over global growth.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was last at $76 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $66.63 (CLc1) [O/R]. Gold  was a tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 04:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: 2-DEER: China's HNA Group seeks buyer for $300 million 'Dream Jet' - sources,"By Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has put up for sale its luxurious $300-million-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"" that sports a ""seven-star"" hotel-style cabin, say six aviation industry sources familiar with the matter.
The 40-seat Boeing (N:BA) 787 jet with registration ""2-DEER"", used for charters as well as by top HNA officials, recently took Cambodian president Hun Sen to the U.N. General Assembly in New York and flew between Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo, and Beijing, on dates coinciding with a visit to China by President Denis Sassou Nguesso. 
Under pressure from Beijing, aviation-to-hotels group HNA has in 2018 sold real estate, stakes in overseas companies and aviation-related assets after a $50-billion acquisition spree in recent years. 
One of the industry sources said HNA was attempting to sell the fleet in its wholly-owned private Deer Jet division and then shut it down. 
The jet was put on the market in late July, after Co-Chairman Wang Jian died in an accidental fall in France, another source said. 
It could prove difficult to attract close to the purchase price for the 40-seat 787, because of the limited market for widebody private jets, which are usually bought by governments or billionaires who prefer to select their own interior design, two of the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A 787-8 business jet has a list price of $232 million, but the interiors typically cost $90 to $170 million, Boeing says. 
The interiors of the HNA [HNAIRC.UL] jet, registered as ""2-DEER"" in Guernsey, dubbed the ""Dream Jet"" and featuring a 17-hour non-stop range, took 2.5 years to complete, Deer Jet says on its website. 
""A lot of the large aircraft have to go for two-thirds of the (original) price or half the price because whoever buys it will have different thinking on interiors,"" one of the sources said. ""Nobody is going to spend that money and sit in somebody else's bed with a different cushion. They want what they want.""
Some of the fittings are by designers such as Baccarat and Fendi, according to a Deer Jet tweet in 2016. A brochure for charter clients seen by Reuters calls 2-DEER a ""flying home"" with 26 lie-flat beds.
Deer Jet's Beijing office is open to serious offers and has not assigned a jet broker, one of the sources said.
HNA and Deer Jet declined to comment on 2-DEER. They were not immediately available for comment on whether the rest of the fleet was for sale after Bloomberg on Thursday first reported that Deer Jet was looking to sell ""dozens of jets"".
FLYING WORLD LEADERS
Since January, HNA has sold or agreed to sell more than $20 billion worth of assets, including real estate in Sydney, New York and Hong Kong, according to Reuters calculations and media reports.
""We do understand that as they are doing the corporate restructuring they are intending to sell the 787,"" one of the sources said. ""It is a very expensive aircraft, due to the operational costs."" 
The HNA jet had originally been owned by Dell Technologies Inc (N:DVMT) founder and chairman Michael Dell, one of the sources said. A spokesman for Dell's private interests declined to comment.
Boeing said it had sold 15 787 business jets, with 12 delivered to date. Two other Boeing 787 business jets globally are also for sale, sources said.
HNA's 787 was unveiled publicly in 2016 at a European business jet show and has been available for charters to VIPs, including world leaders, at a cost of around $74,000 an hour.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen used 2-DEER to visit the United Nations headquarters in New York as well as Brussels, Istanbul and Geneva over the last month, a Cambodian government spokesman confirmed on Wednesday. 
The spokesman had no comment on whether the government was interested in buying the jet, which used the flight number KHM01 for the leader's flights, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows. 

In September, the jet flew from Brazzaville to China as CONGO01, coinciding with a visit by the African country's President Denis Sassou Nguesso, according to FlightRadar24 and media reports of his whereabouts. The Republic of Congo government was unable to immediately provide comment.

In response to a tweet asking when the Model 3 will be available in Australia, Musk wrote ""Around mid 2019"", later tweeting that it will also be available in the UK during the same period. 
Tesla has been trying to fast track vehicle deliveries of its new Model 3 to customers. The company's ability to deliver on production targets for Model 3 sedans has weighed on its stock in the past.
On Wednesday, Tesla reported a net profit, positive cash flow and wider-than-expected margins for the latest quarter, as higher production volumes of its new Model 3 began to pay off.

The company said it would start taking orders in Europe and China for the Model 3 before the end of the year.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell as much as 1 percent before paring losses slightly to trade down 0.7 percent by 0730 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) hit its lowest level since Dec 8 2016 in early deals.
The peripheral euro-zone indices of Spain (IBEX) and Italy (FTMIB) bucked the trend, rising 0.3 percent each in early trade.
Earnings dominated the day with some heavy losses.

The plummeting stock dragged the media sector down (SXMP) 3.2 percent, set for its worst day since the Brexit vote selloff in June 2016.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","Nokia kicks off new cost cuts, counts on 5G for profit boost","By Jussi Rosendahl and Anne Kauranen
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) kicked off a new cost-cutting program on Thursday and repeated an ambitious profit forecast, saying operators' demand for next-generation 5G networks would pick up pace in the remainder of the year.
The networks industry - dominated by Nokia, Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and China's Huawei [HWT.UL] - has been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability this year.
The Finnish firm, which also reported a drop in quarterly profit, said it was targeting annual cost savings of 700 million euros ($799 million) by the end of 2020, without elaborating on the scale of expected job reductions.
It is yet to complete its previous 1.2 billion euro cost cuts, launched after its 2016 acquisition of Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA).
""We are making progress but still have more work to do get our network margins where we would like them to be,"" Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a conference call.
He reaffirmed an outlook for Nokia's networks business to deliver a full-year operating margin of 6-9 percent. The margin for the first nine months is only 2.6 percent.
""Despite some risks related to short-term delays in project timing and product deliveries, we remain on track to deliver on our full-year guidance,"" he added.
As evidence of the 5G cycle taking root, Nokia in July signed a $3.5 billion deal to supply U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile with new network gear.
Nokia's operating profit in the third quarter fell 27 percent from a year ago to 487 million euros broadly in line with analysts' mean forecast in a Reuters poll of 492 million euros. The year-ago profit figure was boosted by a catch-up licensing payment.
More than half of the earnings were generated by Nokia's highly profitable patent business, a legacy of Nokia's history as the market-leading mobile phone maker.
Nokia also announced an extension to its patent license deal with Samsung (KS:005930) on Thursday. 
Shares in the company fell 1 percent in early trade.
""Networks business sales is growing, which indicates that the market is picking up... I believe Q4 will be very strong,"" said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes Equity Research, which has an ""accumulate"" rating on the stock.

""But there is a small risk of a profit warning for the remainder of the year.""

The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank said in a report last month it thinks are suspicious.
The scandal has led the bank's former chief executive Thomas Borgen to resign and almost halved Danske Bank share price since February.
""Obviously, supervision must be strengthened and conducted in a different way than it has been done in the period 2007-2015 when we can see that Europe's largest money laundering case was not detected,"" conservative minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) early on Thursday.
He said that a profound evaluation of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) had begun and that it would include inputs from the FSA itself as well as from other stakeholders.
""It is a great task, and it must be done thoroughly,"" the minister said.
The FSA's handling of the Danske Bank case has been widely criticized, and the European Union's banking supervisor has begun an inquiry into it.
Jarlov said it was crucial that the FSA be given tools to scrutinize the information it gets from banks more thoroughly.

""It seems that supervision largely has been based on the banks' own assessments of how they themselves think they are combating money laundering. That is obviously not enough,"" he said.

""The automotive industry and thus also Daimler are still in a very challenging environment. The continued high demand from our customers makes us confident for the fourth quarter,"" Zetsche said in a statement.
Third-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell 27 percent year on year to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion), hit by a 35 percent EBIT fall at Mercedes-Benz Cars to 1.37 billion euros.
The profit slide is accompanied by continuing friction between the German government and carmakers over whether to fit expensive emissions-reducing exhaust systems to older diesel vehicles and an ongoing U.S. investigation into emissions. 
Sales of Mercedes-Benz Cars, a division that includes the Smart brand, are expected to reach last year's level, Daimler said after reporting a 6 percent drop in deliveries in the third quarter.
Earnings were also hit by a provision taken after a court ruling confirming a ban on the R134a air conditioning fluid used in Mercedes-Benz cars, Daimler said. 
Daimler last week said its full-year operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent because of ""government proceedings and measures in various regions"", in what amounted to the company's second profit warning in four months.

In May German prosecutors searched Daimler's offices as part of a fraud investigation related to possible manipulation of diesel exhaust emission levels and U.S. authorities have asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels on certain vehicles.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) slid nearly 7 percent to a nine-year low on Thursday after it said data of about 9.4 million passengers of Cathay and its unit, Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd, had been accessed without authorization.
Cathay said late on Wednesday that in addition to 860,000 passport numbers and about 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers, the hackers accessed 403 expired credit card numbers and 27 credit card numbers with no card verification value (CVV).
The company said it discovered suspicious activity on its network in March 2018 and investigations in early May confirmed that certain personal data had been accessed.
Hong Kong's privacy commission on Thursday expressed serious concern over the data breach and urged the airline to notify passengers affected by the leak as soon as possible and provide details immediately.
Shares of Cathay Pacific slid as much as 6.8 percent on Thursday to HK$9.90, their lowest in nine years. That compared with a 2 percent fall for the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI).
The stock pared losses and was down 4.9 percent at 0528 GMT.
""People are concerned about why it took so long for them to make an announcement,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.
""The market demands more details and explanation.""
Cathay Pacific's chief customer and commercial officer, Paul Loo, defended the length of time it took the airline to alert affected passengers.
""We didn't want to create an unnecessary scare. Now we understand very well how each customer has been affected,"" Loo told broadcaster RTHK, adding that those affected would be notified in the next two days.
Cathay told Reuters it was important to have accurate information so that people know the facts.
""Now that we have conducted a thorough investigation, we are notifying anyone who has potentially been affected,"" the airline said in an email statement.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the data breach or what the information might be used for.
Cathay said the Hong Kong Police had been notified about the breach and there was no evidence that any personal information had been misused. Analysts were cautious.
""We expect its share price to remain jittery in the near term,"" BOCOM International's Geoffrey Cheng said in a research note. ""We will revisit our earnings forecasts and review our rating for CPA soon.""
The data breach comes as the airline is undergoing a turnaround designed to cut costs and increase revenue, after back-to-back years of losses, to allow it to better compete against rivals from the Middle East, mainland China and budget airlines.
In August, Cathay Pacific posted a narrower half-year loss on a strong rise in airfares and cargo rates and flagged expectations for a better second half despite economic headwinds from mounting U.S.-China trade tensions.

The hack also comes more than a month after British Airways apologized over the theft of credit card details of hundreds of thousands of its customers over a two-week period in an attack on its website and app.

Big Drops
Stocks from New York to Tokyo slumped on a mix of concerns including a potential economic cycle peak and slowdown in corporate earnings growth, as well as the ongoing tightening of monetary policies. Reports of potential bombs being sent to two former U.S. presidents and the New York headquarters of CNN didn’t help sentiment, and the S&P 500 is now little changed for the year. The European futures open will shortly give us an idea of the extent of the damage to be expected in the region this morning.
Big Tech
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). kicked off this week’s run of large-cap U.S. tech earnings, with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. both due after the market close later Thursday. Microsoft posted another quarter of brisk revenue growth driven by cloud services, and its stock edged higher in after-hours trading. But fellow Nasdaq-100 index member Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. stole the limelight, announcing just the third quarter of positive earnings in its history, sending the shares up by about 10 percent. Elsewhere, another semiconductor stock plunged as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. results underwhelmed.
Mad Men
British advertising giant WPP Plc (LON:WPP) reports third quarter results before the market open, providing an opportunity to shift attention toward turnaround progress under new chief executive Mark Read. Results are expected to show weakness in the U.S., as well as creative advertising in general, although that could be offset by offset by strength in media investment management, analysts said ahead of the release. The report will also be eyed by investors in French rival Publicis Groupe, whose third quarter revenue growth numbers missed consensus last week.
More Beer
The world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev NV reported revenue for the third quarter that missed the average analyst estimate this morning and cut its interim dividend in half. Shares of the Budweiser- and Stella Artois-maker had risen on Wednesday following updates from Heineken NV and Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) A/S. The latter raised its 2018 earnings outlook, in part due to Europe’s warm summer weather.
Banks, Banks, Banks
Banks’ results keep coming, with Swiss giant UBS Group AG reporting trading revenue at its corporate and investment bank up 19 percent from a year earlier. Its third-quarter net income beat the highest estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. U.K.-focused Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY) is also due to release numbers this morning, after challenger Metro Bank Plc showed signs that competition in residential mortgages is putting pressure on margins; meanwhile, the Bank of England’s August base-rate increase has raised the cost of deposits.
Draghi’s Tone
It’s ECB rate decision day, and while eurozone interest-rate setters aren’t expected to make a change this month, the tone of President Mario Draghi’s post-decision speech could, as usual, offer clues over timing of the next policy tightening. The euro fell against the dollar on Wednesday as markets speculated that Draghi will soften his rhetoric somewhat, in response to recent disappointing economic data."

FAW has a joint venture with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which produces VW and Audi cars, and one with Toyota (T:7203), which builds the Crown and Corolla models.
The 16 banks in the agreement with FAW include China Development Bank, China Construction Bank (SS:601939), Bank of China (SS:601988) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (HK:1398).
China's economy in the third quarter slowed to its weakest quarterly pace since the global financial crisis, data last week showed, hurt by the weakest factory output since February 2016 as carmakers slashed production due to a sales slowdown.

The figures came as regulators move quickly to calm nervous investors as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States began to bite.

The world's No.2 memory chipmaker said July-September operating profit rose 73 percent year-on-year to 6.5 trillion won ($5.7 billion). That compared with a 6.3 trillion won average forecast from 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Sales rose 41 percent to a record high of 11.4 trillion won compared to the same period a year ago.
Looking ahead, the company said Chinese consumers' growing demand for high-density chips for low-end smartphones would help offset the negative impacts of slower DRAM chip price growth and falling NAND flash chip prices. 
Macroeconomic factors including global trade conflicts would however fuel uncertainty around the pace of the slowdown in the DRAM market, it added.
Price falls in memory chips are set to end a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring profits for chipmakers around the world, analysts say.
Prices of DRAM memory chips - which help servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices process large amounts of streaming data - would fall about 5 percent in the fourth quarter after jumping about 25 percent since 2016, Taurus Investment and Securities analyst Lee Wang-jin said.
Average prices of NAND flash memory chips, used in smartphones and memory cards, would fall about 9 percent in the fourth quarter, he added.
""Tough times are ahead until roughly the first half of next year, but we will have a clearer picture early next year when chipmakers lay out their investment plans,"" Lee said.

SK Hynix's operating profit would begin to fall year-on-year from the second quarter of 2019, Refinitiv data shows.

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 08:16PM ET</span>","Tesla shares jump as Musk delivers quarterly profit, cash","By Alexandria Sage and Sonam Rai
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) reported a net profit, positive cash flow and wider-than-expected margins for the latest quarter on Wednesday, delivering on Chief Executive Elon Musk's promise to turn the electric carmaker profitable as higher production volumes of its new Model 3 began to pay off.
Tesla reiterated that it expected to repeat its net profit in the current quarter, helping drive the company's shares up 14 percent in after hours trading.
The controversial Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to reach, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make Tesla profitable for only the third quarter in its 15-year existence, providing a positive end to a difficult quarter for the CEO whose leadership was openly questioned only weeks ago.
""We can actually be cash flow positive and profitable in all quarters going forward,"" Musk said, qualifying that he excluded those in which a big debt payment comes due, such as the first quarter of 2019. 
Musk reiterated that Tesla currently does not plan to raise equity or debt. 
Tesla said it would begin taking orders in Europe and China for the Model 3 before the end of 2018. Deliveries would begin to Europe in late February or March, and those to China in the second quarter, if not before, Musk said. 
Musk said he planned to begin local production in China next year in a 'capital efficient manner,' suggesting the company might use a similar tent structure for car assembly that has already been used at its Fremont, California, plant. He gave no further details on plans in China.
Meanwhile, seeking to quell speculation that a large number of prospective buyers had canceled their reservations due to delays receiving their cars, Tesla said only 20 percent of North American reservation-holders had canceled their bookings. 
Free cash flow at $881 million was positive for only the third time in Tesla's history and was helped by a surge of new production of the Model 3, lower capital expenditures, and more efficient use of working capital. 
While still below the production target it set for June of 5,000 Model 3s per week, the roughly 4,300 Model 3s the company is now averaging per week were enough to boost results.
Despite pledges by Musk and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja to manage operations and future projects in a capital efficient manner, some on Wall Street still foresee a capital raising as likely at some point. 
""(Raising cash) became a whole lot easier,"" after Wednesday's results, said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Fienseth. ""He will need to do it, right? But if you got a profitable company it's whole lot easier to raise money.""
(Graphic: Tesla's balance sheet and strategy - tmsnrt.rs/2PPLXM5)
SURGING PAST ESTIMATES 
The results were a boost for the embattled company after a quarter in which U.S. security regulators accused Musk of fraud for tweeting that he had secured funding for a deal to take the company private which never materialized.
A settlement between Musk, Tesla and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Musk to remain as CEO, but required a new independent chairman to oversee an array of capital- intensive new projects in 2019, from a factory in China to development of Tesla's new Model Y SUV. 
Musk had vowed since May that Tesla would be profitable in both the third and fourth quarters, and has repeated that the company would not need new capital from financial backers.
Tesla said earlier this month it built 53,239 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, in line with its target of 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles, and delivered 56,065 of the cars to customers.
Musk has been under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the Model 3, seen as crucial to Tesla's profitability and its ability to be a high-volume car producer.
More sales of the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 currently on offer helped margins which rose to over 20 percent in the quarter, Tesla said, above its projection of 15 percent margins. Lower labor hours per vehicle helped, as did lower material costs.
Total revenue more than doubled to $6.82 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $6.33 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Tesla ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash after spending $510.3 million in quarterly capital expenses. It said cash would remain at least unchanged in the fourth quarter, despite a repayment of $230 million in convertible notes coming due. 
Tesla reported a profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, earnings were $2.90 per share, versus an average analyst estimate of a loss of 19 cents per share. A Refinitiv SmartEstimate, which gives more weight to analysts with strong track records, estimated Tesla would earn 3 cents per share.
Tesla faces pressing cash needs at its Fremont, California factory, where the company has had a longstanding goal of eventually increasing production to 10,000 Model 3s per week. Musk said a goal of 7,000 was more realistic and would require significantly less capital spending. 
Three new vehicles are in development at Tesla: the Model Y, a new $200,000 Roadster and an electric heavy-duty truck that Musk unveiled last November. 

Its sprawling Gigafactory battery factory outside Reno, Nevada is only partially complete, and plans for assembly plants in Europe and China are both big-ticket items on the horizon.

The suit, filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County, seeks undisclosed damages, a court order for a review of the company's representations, and that the company corrects ""numerous misrepresentations"" to investors. 
It alleges Exxon assured investors it had properly evaluated the impact of climate regulations on its business using a ""proxy cost"" for the likely effects of future events on its business. However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, the suit claims. 
The company also failed to properly account for such costs in determining its volume of oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets, a metric important to investors, the suit claims. 
""The company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,"" Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. ""Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing."" 
Exxon ""looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed,"" said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement. 
He further described the suit as the ""product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.""
The suit was brought under the Martin Act, a civil statute that has been used by New York prosecutors to pursue fraud claims against investment and other financial companies. 
""In bringing this case, the state is yet again using the Martin Act as a political weapon,"" said Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, calling the case ""nothing more than a contortion of the securities litigation system."" 
Exxon unsuccessfully fought to halt the New York investigation and a similar probe by the state of Massachusetts that claims Exxon misled consumers with its statements on climate change. 
""This is a very significant lawsuit,"" said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The New York state attorney general has gotten a lot of documents and we should assume they filed the suit based on the information received during that process."" 

Exxon and other oil companies including  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 07:51PM ET</span>","Ford third-quarter profit beats estimates, shares rise","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday reported slightly higher than expected third-quarter profit and stuck to its targets for the year, raising investor hopes for a strong fourth quarter and sending its shares up as much as 7 percent after-hours. 
Profit was down as high commodity costs and a China sales slump partially offset strong demand for high-margin pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles in North America. 
The No. 2 U.S. automaker maintained its full-year earnings forecast. Last quarter, Ford announced a pending restructuring that could lead to pretax charges of up to $11 billion. On Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said that plan remains in place. 
But the CFO said while Ford is still committed to an overall pretax margin target of 8 percent, the company will not hit it by 2020 as previously announced. 
Some investors and analysts have been frustrated by a lack of details about the restructuring and Shanks said the company still has nothing to announce at this time. 
""Nothing has changed in terms of providing a lot of details,"" Shanks told reporters at the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.
""I know it's frustrating,"" Shanks later told analysts on a conference call. ""One can't go to the last page of the book and look at the ending. It's got to sort of unfold.""
Ford's vehicle sales in China, where Ford lost $378 million in the quarter, fell 43 percent in September from a year earlier and are down 30 percent in the first nine months of the year. Ford blames its weak China business on an aging model lineup that is awaiting an overhaul.
""Our performance in China clearly has been disappointing. I can assure you the leadership of the company has swarmed the issue,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said on the call.
Ford will accelerate local production of its vehicles in China as part of its push to improve profit there, said Jim Farley, president of global markets. 
Late on Tuesday, Ford named a new chief of its China operations, ending a nine-month search and putting in place an American national born in China.
The automaker has said China sales will not get a boost until Ford's new SUVs begin rolling out there in 2019 and 2020.
Speaking to reporters at Ford's headquarters, CFO Shanks said that industry-wide Chinese vehicle sales would decline more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter, and fall in 2019 compared with this year.
Shanks said Ford welcomed the tentative agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico on an updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but said the automaker would also like to see tariffs on steel and aluminum addressed as part of the revised treaty.
Hopefully those tariffs ""will be eliminated and we'll get more normal economic pricing,"" Shanks said. 
Last month, CEO Hackett said U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs would cost the automaker $1 billion in profit in 2018 and 2019. Shanks on Wednesday said the combined impact of the metals and China-related tariffs would approach $1 billion this year.
Virtually all of Ford's quarterly profit came from sales of high-margin pickup trucks like the F-150 and SUVs in North America, where Ford posted an operating profit of almost $2 billion in the quarter. Ford has been increasingly reliant on the full-size F-150 pickup truck to drive results, with Farley saying Ford's market share and average transaction prices rose in the quarter.
Ford said it managed a North American third-quarter pretax margin of 8.8 percent.
The company reported a third-quarter net profit of $993 million, or 25 cents per share, a 36 percent drop from $1.6 billion or 39 cents per share in the year earlier quarter. 
Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 29 cents per share in the quarter, 1 cent above average analyst estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue for the quarter rose to $37.7 billion from $36.5 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $33.3 billion.
The company said it still expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $1.30 to $1.50, indicating it sees a fourth-quarter profit in the range of 31 to 51 cents a share. Analysts expect a fourth-quarter profit of 31 cents.
Ford shares rose as much as 7 percent in trading after the closing bell. 

They had closed at a 9-year low on Wednesday of $8.18. The last time shares hit that level, the industry was being battered by the Great Recession and Ford's U.S. rivals General Motors Co (N:GM) and Chrysler, now part of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) had just emerged from government-led bankruptcies.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 07:37PM ET</span>",Microsoft sales and profit beat estimates on cloud growth,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) beat Wall Street estimates for revenue and profit in its first quarter on Wednesday, as more businesses signed up for its Azure cloud computing services and Office 365 software.
Microsoft shares have tripled since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014 and refocused the company on building data center software and services. The stock, which has risen more than 21 percent over the past 12 months, gained 1.9 percent in after-hours trading following the earnings report.
Much of Microsoft's recent growth has been fueled by companies moving to the cloud from on-premise data centers, helping it to beat analysts' profit targets for more than two years.
Commercial cloud revenue, which includes Azure sales, hit $8.5 billion, up 47 percent from the year-ago quarter. The growth margin for that business rose to 62 percent from 58 percent in the year-ago quarter and 59 percent in the prior quarter.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) leads in cloud infrastructure services with a second-quarter market share of over 30 percent, according to market research firm Canalys, but Microsoft's share rose to 18 percent from 16 percent in the previous quarter.
Azure revenue rose 76 percent over the year, slower than the 89 percent rise in the previous quarter.
Blair Hanley Frank, principal analyst at technology research and advisory firm ISG, said investors have been alerted to Azure's slower growth.
""Seeing that number decline to 76 percent where it was in the 80s and 90s is interesting. It's not yet clear what that means,"" Frank said. ""Obviously Microsoft is going to see some fall in growth rate as the revenue grows.""
Mark Sami, vice president at consultancy firm SPR, said Microsoft's ""mature hybrid cloud offering"" helps to fuel growth and leaves rivals like Amazon ""playing catch up.""
Microsoft's focus on fast-growing cloud applications and platforms is helping it beat slowing demand for personal computers that has hurt sales of its popular Windows operating system.
Revenue from Microsoft's personal computing division, its largest by revenue, rose 14.6 percent to $10.75 billion. That figure beat the consensus analyst estimate of $10.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers, but gaming is the growth driver with revenue up 44 percent from a year ago.
Microsoft forecast strong revenue for that division in the holiday quarter, of $12.8 billion to $13.2 billion.
""Xbox has the key gaming community and monetization capability,"" said Nadella.
Revenue at Microsoft's productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office 365, rose 18.6 percent to $9.77 billion, topping analysts' average expectation of $9.40 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft estimated revenue of $9.95 billion to $10.15 billion for that unit in the current quarter. 
Overall, the Redmond, Washington-based software company's revenue rose to $29.08 billion from $24.54 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $27.90 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Net income rose to $8.82 billion, or $1.14 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $6.58 billion, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Analysts had expected earnings of 96 cents per share.

Chevron will spend about $150 million to replace vulnerable pipes, improve inspections and training, and make other safety improvements at all its domestic refineries, the department said in a statement.
Chevron also will pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and will spend at least $10 million on environmental projects in the communities near its refineries in California, Mississippi, Utah and Hawaii, the statement said.

""As part of this settlement, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. has agreed to significant investments at its refineries to enhance the safety and reliability of operations,"" it said.
The settlement with the Justice Department, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality is subject to final court approval.

It was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is subject to a 30-day public comment period.

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BofA top brass tries to soothe disgruntled dealmakers - sources,"By Imani Moise and Dasha Afanasieva
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Top Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives, including Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, made a surprise appearance at a gathering of the bank's senior dealmakers on Tuesday in an effort to boost morale, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Moynihan, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio and Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag assured those attending a gathering for managing directors in Bank of America's investment bank that they had the full support of senior leadership and the broader organization, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Although the offsite event happens every year, senior executives do not always make an appearance. Their supportive comments come at a time when Bank of America's investment bank has been plagued by falling market share and revenue, and after a string of departures by senior leaders.
Troubles began early this year after Bank of America reported $292 million in losses related to South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International, and began a review of risk-taking within the investment bank.
So far in 2018, its investment banking fees have tumbled 20 percent, even as rivals have reported gains.
Analysts generally describe the issues with Bank of America's investment banking unit as a small hurdle that is more than offset by a positive trajectory in other, larger bank businesses.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr, for instance, put more weight on the ""strong operating environment, rising CEO confidence, low unemployment, wage growth, strong consumer spending levels and BofA's expanding banker coverage"" than in the slump in investment banking fees last quarter.
However, executives have expressed concern as Bank of America has slipped to fifth place in investment banking league tables year-to-date from third place in 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
""We know we can do better,"" Donofrio said on a conference call to discuss earnings earlier this month.
At the dealmaker meeting on Tuesday, Matthew Koder, the incoming head of the division, gave a detailed presentation that showed the investment bank underperforming in all sectors, especially in the United States. He told attendees it is imperative that the unit changes its culture.
Rankings detailed in Bank of America's financial reports show it slipping in a few areas over the past year, including high-yield corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities, but retaining its top position in investment-grade corporate debt, both in the United States and globally.
Koder is taking over the business at year-end, following the planned departure of current investment banking chief Christian Meissner. He is one of more than two dozen senior bankers or executives in the division who have left since the beginning of 2017, according to a report by recruiting firm Sheffield Haworth cited in a recent Wall Street Journal article.
Moynihan, Donofrio and Montag tried to assure senior Wall Street bankers that their business has the assets and talent to get back on track, and that doing better was a matter of using resources more effectively rather than changing strategy, one of the people said.

One attendee told Reuters the messaging was encouraging, but said the business will not generate better performance until management and culture improves.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Verizon to spend $25 million to upgrade Florida network,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said on Wednesday it will spend $25 million to update its network in Florida's Panhandle, an area hard-hit by service outages after Hurricane Michael.
Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, said in a statement its network was operational in the area and efforts are underway to ""further stabilize and strengthen our wireless network.""
The company said it would commit the funds ""to build the most technologically advanced wireless network in the area"" and plans to add next-generation wireless 5G technology in Panama City, Florida, joining the much larger cities of Los Angeles, Houston, Indianapolis and Sacramento, California.
The move follows criticism of the company's performance by elected officials in Florida after the storm damage.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai last week called for wireless carriers to waive October bills for people most severely affected by Hurricane Michael. Later that day, Verizon said it would waive bills for consumer and business customers in two Florida counties for three months. Verizon last week extended the three-month bill waiver to another seven Florida counties.
Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10 as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States. The storm damaged fiber networks and electrical wires necessary for broadband and mobile phone service.
Pai said last week that progress in restoring service was ""completely unacceptable"" and that the FCC will investigate the outages. He said Tuesday he had met with all four major U.S. wireless carriers last week to understand the ""urgency"" of the situation.
The FCC said nearly all wireless cell sites are back in service in Florida, but 14 percent remain out in Gulf County and 17 percent in Bay County.
Verizon attributed the delays in restoring coverage in part to significant damage to fiber connections in Florida's Panhandle, the strength of the storm and repeated new cuts to its fiber network by repair crews.
U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said last week in a letter to Verizon that its competitors had been restoring service much faster.
Verizon said the $25 million network technology upgrade would be largely spent in 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged again on Wednesday, confirming a correction for the Nasdaq and erasing the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year, as disappointing forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data fueled jitters about economic and profit growth.
The Nasdaq closed down 12.4 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high, falling 4.4 percent for the day in its biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 18, 2011.
Chipmakers Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) (N:STM) warned of slowing demand. They followed disappointing forecasts on Tuesday from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and 3M (N:MMM).
The forecasts gave investors further reason to pause and helped fuel the selling momentum, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""Once a snowball like this starts, it doesn't stop until it gets to the bottom of the hill. And we don't know if we're at the bottom yet,"" Tuz said.
Stocks have been punished this month by a range of worries, from rising borrowing costs and bond yields to Italy's budget and U.S. congressional elections due in less than two weeks. 
On Wednesday, data showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a near two-year low in September, the latest sign that rising mortgage rates and higher prices were hurting demand for housing.
Adding to weaker sentiment in late trading, the Federal Reserve said in a report on the economy that U.S. factories have raised prices because of tariffs.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, jumped 4.52 points to close at 25.23, its highest close since Feb. 12. The S&P 500 fell for a sixth consecutive day.
""It looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 608.01 points, or 2.41 percent, to 24,583.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 84.59 points, or 3.09 percent, to 2,656.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 329.14 points, or 4.43 percent, to 7,108.40.
Texas Instruments (O:TXN) dropped 8.2 percent, helping pull the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) down 6.6 percent in its biggest daily percentage drop since October 2014. Intel (O:INTC), due to report earnings later this week, fell 4.7 percent.
The beaten-down S&P technology sector retreated (SPLRCT) another 4.4 percent.
While third-quarter profit growth estimates have risen to 22.4 percent from 21.6 percent in the last 10 days, weaker forecasts have pulled down fourth-quarter growth estimates to 19.5 percent from 20 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 91 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 445 new lows.
About 9.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

Microsoft shares rose 4.5% in after-hours trading.
But the semiconductor sector will still be a major problem for the sector.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) reported revenue after the bell that was below Street forecasts and also guided revenue down. The stock had already been selling off on the day due to weak guidance from other chipmakers.
AMD stock plunged 17% after hours, adding to the 9% loss it saw in the regular session.
Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) impressed the market after reporting a strong profit when analysts were expecting a loss. Revenue also topped expectations.
The stock surged 12% postmarket.
2. Twitter Earnings on Tap Before the Bell
It’s a tech earnings extravaganza tomorrow, starting with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which is now reporting before the bell.
After the close of trading the major reports come from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Also ahead of trading there are earnings reports from healthcare, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), energy, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), communication services, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and transportation,  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP).
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Dunkin (NASDAQ:DNKN) will also weigh in.
Disappointing earnings before the bell weighed on stocks throughout trading today, with investor concerns rising about in the impact of tariffs and trade battles and weak guidance in the tech sector.
3. More Housing Data, Durable Goods Orders Coming

Visa's total payments volume jumped 11 percent in the quarter ended September, while the number of processed transactions rose 12 percent. Payments volume represents the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa's branding.
Rising wages, job growth and lower taxes have spurred U.S. consumer confidence to its highest in nearly two decades, driving spending on everything from luxury goods to day-to-day essentials.
Visa, its rival Mastercard (N:MA) and credit-card issuer  American Express  (N:AXP), as a result, are processing more transactions and earning more in fees.
Visa's net income rose to $2.85 billion in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, from $2.14 billion a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, Visa earned $1.21 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.20, according to Refinitiv data. The result represents the ninth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected earnings for Visa.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Trump, industry work behind the scenes to save Saudi arms package","By Mike Stone, Patricia Zengerle and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration and the U.S. defense industry are scrambling to save the few actual deals in the much-touted $110 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia as concerns rise about the role of the Kingdom's leadership over the death of a prominent critic.
President Donald Trump has hedged his criticism of Saudi leaders over the disappearance and death of U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, insisting he does not want to imperil a ""tremendous order"" of $110 billion of weapons he says will support 500,000 U.S. jobs - figures that experts say are highly exaggerated.
Khashoggi's killing in the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2 has caused global outrage and raised questions about the possible role of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia who controls the kingdom's security services. 
Riyadh has blamed a ""rogue operation"" and said the crown prince had no knowledge of the killing.
Working behind the scenes in Washington, a defense industry group has circulated talking points to industry executives, focusing on the importance of arms sales to U.S. allies. Companies hope to preserve the deals on the Saudi list with near-term delivery dates in 2019 and 2020, ideally firming up the soft commitments made during Trump's trip in May 2017. 
""Contingency Points On Defense Sales to Saudi Arabia"" were emailed to defense contractors by the Aerospace Industry Association (AIA) in recent days, instructing executives to explain that stopping arms sales could reduce the U.S. ability to influence foreign governments.
Talking points help executives promote their point of view when speaking with their own staff, suppliers, the media, government officials and elected officials. 
The AIA email says the death of Khashoggi ""sparked an important conversation about the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" and details two short responses to whether industry communicated with U.S. government about Khashoggi and the scale of arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year before a lengthy response to the ""jobs question.""
Yet the answer, laid out in four bullet points, does not mention the numbers Trump has spoken about or any other estimates of possible job gains, instead touching on ""economic impact"" and explaining how weapons sales strengthen political-military relationships.
""When we sell American products to allies and partners, we can ensure our adversaries aren't able to supplant our political, military or economic ties,"" the document says.
AIA spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said she wouldn't comment on the details of the email sent to their members, adding they do not tell their members what to say on any given issue. AIA's executive committee includes the chief executives of the top five U.S. defense contractors  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Raytheon Co and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). 
CONGRESS CONCERNED
Defense contractors have a lot to worry about. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can block foreign military arms sales, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that a defense contractor had come to see him at his office, and he had warned that – even before Khashoggi's death - it would not be a good time to try to push a major defense deal through Congress.
Speaking of Khashoggi's death Corker said: ""I know that Congress will not let this idly go by. This is something that enrages people, as it should.""
A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday that would stop most U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to Khashoggi's death.
Under mounting Congressional criticism the White House has also stepped up its efforts to save the Saudi arms sales package. Peter Navarro, Trump's White House trade chief and architect of his ""Buy American"" policy to ease restrictions on foreign arms sales, has been a significant voice during the Khashoggi affair in reinforcing to the president the importance of Saudi weapons deals and the U.S. job implications, a senior U.S. official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
At a roundtable with defense contractors at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona on Saturday, Trump and his aides sought to ease top executives concerns about future Saudi arms sales, assuring them that the President would do all he could to keep them on track, the official said.
JOBS, PAYMENTS
How Trump has arrived at the 500,000 jobs figure deal is unclear since the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, who manufacture nearly every item on the Saudi list, now only employ 383,000 people. 
Since the $110 billion package was first announced 18 months ago, some Saudi payments, like those to Lockheed Martin, for its frigates have begun to flow. But most of the other deals, such as a $13.5 billion THAAD missile defense system from Lockheed, have languished without a firm purchase agreement.
As it stands, the U.S. State Department said it has begun processing over $14.5 billion of military sales to Saudi Arabia since Trump's trip.
Many of the remaining deals were either already negotiated under President Obama or were conditional in nature. Industry executives and government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the Saudis wanted much of the military equipment only if the deals created new jobs the kingdom as a part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative.
According to a 2017 draft list of deals in the arms package seen by Reuters about $95 billion were defined as memorandums of intent, non-binding commitments to buy.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Even before the disappearance of Khashoggi, Trump and Saudi King Salman discussed in a late September phone call the THAAD missile defense system deal, a Saudi official told Reuters earlier this month. The official said the deal could well be closed by the end of the year. The official was speaking before Saudi authorities admitted that Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate, and it was unclear if the case would have any effect on the deal.
Lockheed said this week they did not know when a firm agreement would be signed. 
Saudi Arabia - seen as the linchpin of the Trump administration’s strategy to counter Iran’s influence in the Middle East - is a top buyer of U.S. military equipment. Its imports totaled $65 billion between 2009 and 2016, according to the Government Accountability Office that monitors public finances and halting shipments to the kingdom would be inconceivable for the U.S. defense industry. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JgvPkq)
Still, defense contractors and the administration worry deals could stall in Congress where Democrats and Republicans alike are alarmed by the Khashoggi case, which has laid bare the risks of downgrading human rights concerns amid the ""Buy American"" push.
Even before the news of his death, Democratic lawmakers have effectively blocked at least four military equipment deals from being finalized, leaving them in limbo, largely because of Saudi attacks that killed Yemeni civilians.
""This makes it more likely they'll expand holds to include systems that aren't necessarily controversial by themselves. It's a major concern,"" the senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) slumped about 14% and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) fell about 8%. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell about 9% and 5%, respectively.
The slump in tech blue chips from intraday lows comes ahead of slew of corporate earnings for the sector. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is due Wednesday after the closing bell and Alphabet, Twitter and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are slated for Thursday.
The S&P 500 Information Technology index fell about 4.0%, while the newly-minted S&P 500 Communication Services index, which includes tech heavyweights like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), fell more than 5%.
Concerns over peak earnings was exacerbated as AT&T (NYSE:T), whose quarterly profit fell short of expectations, sending it shares tumbling more than 8%. The wireless carrier blamed the poor results on declining satellite TV sales.
But Boeing (NYSE:BA) offered a sliver of optimism on the earnings front after delivering above-forecast earnings and raising its full-year expectations. It's shares rose 1.4%
Energy, meanwhile, also kept a lid on gains in the broader market, even as oil prices shrugged off a larger-than-expected rise in crude inventories.
In a sign of fragile sentiment on risk, investors flocked to defensive corners of the market. S&P 500 Utilities and S&P 500 Consumer Staples were up about 2% and 0.5%, respectively.
Sentiment on stocks was also weighed down by economic data showing the slump in U.S. housing activity continued.
New home sales dropped 5.5% last month, nearing a two-year low, the Commerce Department said.
The Fed's Beige Book, meanwhile, revealed U.S. businesses continued to express concern about steeper materials and shipping costs owing to a tight labor market and uncertainties over the trade environment.
In corporate news, the New York Attorney General reportedly filed a lawsuit against  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), alleging the company had misled investors by downplaying the risk of climate change, CNBC reported. Its shares fell about 3.0%.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook on Wednesday said customer data was being ""weaponized with military efficiency"" by companies to increase profit and called for a federal privacy law in the United States.
But Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's ad-based business model said users were aware of a trade-off for free services.
Cook, speaking at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, said Apple would support a U.S. privacy law and also touted the iPhone maker's commitment to protect users' data and privacy.
Apple, which designs many of its products so that it cannot see users' data, has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have enmeshed its rivals Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook this year.
""The desire to put profits over privacy is nothing new,"" Cook told a packed audience of privacy regulators, corporate executives and other participants.
Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information are under the spotlight after big breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States.
Cook in his speech cited former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who in a Harvard Law Review article in 1890 warned that gossip was no longer the resource of the idle and the vicious but had become a trade.
""Today that trade has exploded into a data industrial complex. Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,"" Cook said.
""These scraps of data ... each one harmless enough on its own ... are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold,"" Cook said.
""We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,"" he said.
FACEBOOK'S AD-BASED MODEL
Zuckerberg, speaking via video message, said Facebook users were aware of the trade-off between a free service and advertisements.
""Instead of charging people, we charge advertisers to show ads. People consistently tell us that they want a free service and that if they going to see ads to get it, then they want those ads to be relevant,"" he said.
Facebook was investing heavily in both security and privacy even as this impacts on its profitability, Zuckerberg said.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai welcomed the global focus on privacy, saying that the company was doing its part by taking measures to allow users more control over their data.
""User trust is the foundation for everything we do, and privacy and security are fundamental tenets of that,"" he said by video message. ""We've been working for years to provide more transparency and control for our users, and we appreciate the input and partnership from data protection authorities.""
Cook also warned about governments abusing users' data and their trust, a concern for many with elections coming up in several countries.
""Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false.""
Cook said Apple fully backed a federal privacy law in the United States, something Europe has already introduced via its General Data Protection Regulation.
""Users should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for,"" he said. ""This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn’t. Anything less is a sham.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mick Mulvaney, the head of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Wednesday fined a payday lender $200,000 for wrongly hounding borrowers but the penalty fell short of the $3 million his predecessor was seeking, said three sources familiar with the move.
Cash Express LLC, which operates more than 300 storefront lenders in southern U.S. states, made empty threats to ruin customers' credit scores as a way to coerce payment, the CFPB concluded in a settlement announced on Wednesday.
Cash Express ""did not actually report this information"" to credit bureaus like  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX), which made the tactic an abuse, the CFPB determined.
But while Mulvaney, the top cop for U.S. consumer finance, ordered the company to pay a $200,000 penalty for misleading customers and other abuses, his predecessor Richard Cordray had wanted to fine the payday lender $3 million, according to the sources.
Since taking office in November, Mulvaney has diluted fines against several lenders that he determined had broken the law. 
In the past, a Mulvaney spokesman has said the bureau reduced penalties because the CFPB will not ""shake down the productive sector just because we can."" 
A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Cash Express also did not respond to a request for comment.
Cash Express is headquartered in Tennessee but also operates in Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi where customers can face triple-digit interest rates to borrow against their car or future paychecks.
For consumers who do not have a bank account, Cash Express is an option for having a check cashed but that service was abused, the CFPB concluded.
Desperate borrowers did not realize that Cash Express would take a cut of their check to pay down outstanding debts, the CFPB found.
In one instance, a woman who entered a Cash Express carrying a sick baby to redeem a $250 check was upset to leave with only $30 because the company had garnished the check, the CFPB heard.
Mulvaney agreed that Cash Express used abusive practices when it seized the proceeds of checks from borrowers and wrongly threatened to ruin their credit.

Mulvaney also agreed with Cordray that Cash Express was wrong to collect expired debt from consumers. But Mulvaney declined to make Cash Express pay for harassing telephone calls and home visits that Cordray had identified as a violation of the law.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it would not penalize foreign banks boycotting an investment forum in a message of reassurance for a gathering overshadowed by a global outcry over slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The kingdom's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to speak later at the meeting of international investors in his most high profile remarks since the columnist, one of his most prominent critics, was killed in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The world's top oil exporter has come under increasing pressure over the killing of Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, in a crisis that has strained its ties with the West. 
President Donald Trump, in his strongest remarks yet, said Prince Mohammed bears ultimate responsibility as Saudi de facto ruler for the operation that led to Khashoggi's death, explaining the prince is ""running things"" in Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia first denied any involvement in Khashoggi's disappearance after entering the consulate but a Saudi official eventually attributed the death to a chokehold. Turkey has dismissed Saudi efforts to blame rogue operatives and urged the kingdom to search ""top to bottom"" for those responsible.
Dozens of Western politicians, top world bankers and company executives boycotted this year's Future Investment Initiative conference that opened in Riyadh on Tuesday, but the kingdom showed it could still do business by signing deals worth $50 billion on the first day.
The Saudi central bank chief said foreign banks abstaining from the event would not be penalized and may apply for licenses to operate in the Gulf state, the Middle East's largest economy.
""We, at the central bank, deal in complete professional manner whether with local or international banks,"" Ahmed al-Kholifey told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.
""AMAZING DEAL""
The crown prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler and architect of its reform drive, is scheduled to speak at the event in the late afternoon after making a brief appearance on the opening day, declaring the event as ""great - more people more money"".
He wil be accompanied on the panel by the crown prince of Bahrain, which sent a 110-strong delegation to the event, according to a Bahraini delegate. The United Arab Emirates, another Gulf Arab ally, also made a big showing, led by UAE vice president and Dubai ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. 
""They are circling the wagons, rallying the allies in order to weather the storm,"" a Saudi businessman told Reuters.
Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, did not address the forum on Tuesday. He had arrived after attending a meeting at which his father and strongest supporter King Salman received members of Khashoggi's family, including his son Salah. State news agency SPA published pictures of the meeting, including one of the crown prince shaking hands with Salah, who seemed ill at ease.
The prince told Bloomberg earlier this month that Riyadh would announce an ""amazing deal"" at FII this year, where the mood has been subdued compared to the 2017 inaugural event.
Despite the boycott by big hitters, including in Wall Street, of the investment conference, some senior international bankers including from HSBC and Japan's biggest lender MUFG attended in a sign that global banks were reluctant to walk away from lucrative Saudi deals.
Lucid Motors chief technology officer Peter Rawlinson was also present and the U.S. company had a dedicated stand at the venue, placing a sleek gray car in a hallway at the opulent Ritz Carlton Hotel where the three-day event is being held.
In September Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund agreed to invest more than $1 billion in Lucid as part of Saudi efforts to diversify the oil-dependent economy.

Russia's large delegation is led by Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev, who said on Tuesday that while Khashoggi's killing needed to be investigated and the culprits punished, the Saudi economic and social reform drive could not be ignored.

Tesla shares jumped 13 percent on Tuesday after long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research said it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric-auto producer's stock will rise.
Tuesday's sharply higher Tesla stock price turned what had been a profitable year for short-sellers into paper losses totaling $257.3 million so far in 2018.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.
As of the close of trading on Tuesday, Tesla short interest stood at $9.94 billion, with 33.79 million shares shorted, or about 26.5 percent of the company's float, according to S3 data. That made it the most shorted U.S. stock, according to S3 data.
Tesla, which scheduled its earnings release earlier than usual, is expected to post third-quarter results on Wednesday.
Chief Executive Elon Musk has pledged to report quarterly profits in the second half of this year as the company gained traction with production, and deliveries, of its new Model 3 sedan.

On Wednesday morning, Tesla shares were 1.8 percent lower at $288.77.

LONDON (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit could wreak chaos for travelers and a nightmare at airports, global airline industry body IATA warned, calling on British and European Union aviation authorities to put in place a plan to avoid such a worst-case scenario.
Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019 but with just over five months to go, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to reach a withdrawal deal and both sides have stepped up preparations for the possibility there will not be one.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday that planning for a no-deal Brexit needed to move much faster to ensure planes can keep flying and safety and regulatory frameworks keep functioning whatever the new relationship between the pair after March 29. 
""We predict chaos if nothing is done,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters on a call on Wednesday.
""On April 1 it will be us, the airlines, who have to manage millions of passengers potentially grounded in airports unable to take a flight ... It will be a nightmare in European airports and UK airports,"" he warned.
Separately, IATA released forecasts on Wednesday showing that airline passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037, bolstered by strong demand in Asia, though protectionism risks curtailing growth.
De Juniac said the trend toward restricting free trade, such as the introduction of recent tariffs, was weighing on the aviation industry’s most recent forecast of 3.5 percent compound annual passenger growth rate over 20 years, down 0.1 percent from an earlier report. That small decline means 60 million fewer passengers over 20 years.
On Brexit, de Juniac said that airlines were ""completely in the dark"" as to how to plan for what sort of flying rights, safety framework and border management would exist if there is no deal due to a lack of transparency around the discussions. He said they needed certainty on these three critical issues.
Flying rights to, from and within the EU, as well as between the United States and Britain, are covered by EU-wide ""Open Skies"" agreements. But unlike with trade, where Britain would revert to World Trade Organization rules under a no-deal, there is no default fallback option for the aviation sector.
""A backstop contingency plan to keep planes flying after March must be published, and quickly,"" de Juniac said. 
The exclusion of the airline industry from EU-British discussions was exacerbating the potential for chaos, he warned, adding that IATA was ready to offer solutions if asked.
The chief executive of Ryanair (I:RYA), one of Europe's biggest airlines, has warned that if there is a no-deal Brexit, UK flights could be grounded for up to three weeks. 
IATA said it did not expect a scenario where all flights were grounded. ""As a short term, emergency fall-back position, we understand that the EU and UK CAA have plans for a ‘bare bones’ agreement ... to ensure at least a basic level of connectivity,"" IATA said in a study also published on Wednesday.
But it warned that minimum connectivity could be as little as 5 percent of the current number of weekly flights between Britain and Spain. 
In Montreal, Airbus SE (PA:AIR) planemaking head Guillaume Faury told reporters on Wednesday the European company is working on priorities if there is no deal.

""For the moment our focus is completely on managing the transition period and making sure there is no disruption,"" he said,"" he said. ""This uncertainty is by the way, one of the most difficult stakes (involving Brexit).""

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>","AT&T satellite TV numbers disappoint, shares fall","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's quarterly profit for the latest quarter rose less than expected, held back by its declining satellite TV business, sending the company's shares down more than 6 percent.
The second-largest U.S. wireless carrier has been reducing its dependency on the phone business with its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner this year, but it is struggling to grow in the TV market as its satellite business continues to shed customers, while its streaming services have not attracted as many subscribers as analysts had hoped. 
AT&T lost more satellite TV customers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, shedding a net 359,000 subscribers, as viewers move to services like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. It lost 251,000 in the same period last year.
Wall Street analysts expected AT&T to shed 245,000 satellite subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
Meanwhile, DirecTV Now, the company's ""over-the-top"" streaming video service that was launched to lure back viewers who had dropped more expensive satellite TV services, added only 49,000 net subscribers in the quarter, much lower than the 296,000 it added last year. Analysts had expected 287,000 net new customers, according to FactSet.
""Satellite TV subscriber losses are accelerating while over-the-top subscription growth has stalled,"" said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG Research.
AT&T has pared back promotional offers for DirecTV Now to focus on reaching profitability, executives said on a conference call to discuss earnings.
""What we're after is customers who are highly engaged, find the product compelling and use it a lot,"" said AT&T Communications Chief Executive John Donovan during the call. ""That will lend [DirecTV Now] towards being able to be supplemented by an ad model over time.""
In response to an analyst question about the pay TV business's contribution to a recovery in the company's entertainment group, Donovan corrected the analyst and said the recovery would come from the group's broadband business, implying it would not come from the video business that includes DirecTV.
AT&T shares were down 6.1 percent at $31.01 early Wednesday afternoon.
PHONE SUBSCRIBERS UP 
AT&T gained a net 69,000 phone subscribers in the United States who pay a monthly bill, compared with analysts' estimates of a net drop of 22,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. 
Wall Street analysts watch the so-called ""postpaid"" subscriber figure because those customers pay a monthly bill and are more valuable to the company. 
The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.2 billion during the quarter. It did not provide a year-ago figure.
AT&T closed its purchase of Time Warner on June 14 after winning a court battle against the U.S. Department of Justice, which argued that AT&T-owned DirecTV would use Time Warner content to raise costs for pay TV rivals.
A U.S. appeals court said last week it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 6 for the Justice Department's appeal against the merger. 
WarnerMedia recently announced it will introduce a new subscription video service by the end of 2019, anchored by HBO. Within a year, the service will also include original content, WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey previously told Reuters.
Third-quarter net income attributable to AT&T rose to $4.7 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $3.0 billion, or 49 cents per share a year earlier.
Excluding some items, the company earned 90 cents per share, missing analysts' estimate of 94 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Total operating revenue rose 15.3 percent to $45.74 billion, beating analysts' expectation of $45.65 billion.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>",Three tax moves to make before the end of the year,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Think you are getting a big refund in April when you file the first tax return under the changes in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act? 
You better do the math now so you are not surprised by a bill because beyond the much-heralded tax cuts, the new law entails complications that may change your situation in ways you did not expect. 
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 80 percent of taxpayers will receive a tax cut averaging $2,100, while 5 percent face an increase averaging $2,800. But there are a few caveats to that. 
Among those who need to be careful: people in high-tax states or those who have changed jobs, retired or hit age 70-1/2, started or sold a business, have a large family or faced changes such as an older child leaving home or finishing college.
Here is what you need to check now: 
1. Fix your paycheck
Start with the IRS withholding calculator (https://wwwirs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator), to make sure the right amount of tax has come out of your check so far this year. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that about 21 percent of taxpayers have not been withholding enough from their pay during the year to cover taxes they will owe. That means even though your tax bill could be lower than last year’s, you might still owe when you file your return if you have not had the right amount taken out all along. 
Even an up-to-date W-4 may be claiming too many allowances now that deductions and exemptions for family members have been eliminated, said Jackie Perlman, tax analyst for The Tax Institute of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), especially if you filed a W-4 years ago at your workplace and never updated it.
“If you are used to getting a large refund, and anticipate it will go into fixing your van or paying for college, the results could be a blow,” said Cari Weston, director of tax practices and ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
You may also face a penalty if you paid too little throughout the year.
There is still time to fix it. File a new W-4 at your workplace, perhaps with no allowances, so you pay a large chunk of taxes during the rest of the year. If you think you paid too much, do the reverse. 
2. Add up your deductions
This year, the standard deduction has almost doubled to $24,000 for couples and $12,000 for singles. Families will also benefit from larger child credits of $2,000 per child. But deductions for state and local taxes can total only $10,000, which may be far lower than what they previously deducted for income, property and other taxes in high tax states such as New York or California.
Robert Keebler, a CPA with Keebler & Associates in Green Bay, Wisconsin who trains others, suggested a new strategy: Itemize every other year. The idea is to simply take the standard deduction in one year and the next year bunch together as many deductions as possible so they far exceed the standard deduction. 
For example, maybe in the past you gave to charity each year and deducted the contributions, but this year, if you take the standard deduction the charitable contributions will not help cut your taxes. So you could skip giving to charity in 2018 and make a double contributions in 2019.  
You could also wait until January 2019 to pay any state or local tax bills that arrive this December. When those bills come around again in December 2019, pay them quickly that year to amass another big tax deduction. You might also cluster medical expenses like dental or vision into 2019, and time your mortgage interest payments also.
3. Max your retirement 
The easiest way to make a substantial reduction in your taxes continues to be to reduce your income by filling up 401(k)s at work to the maximum or to fund traditional IRAs if you qualify. That will not only help lower your tax bill, but contributing to your retirement fund or health savings account will benefit you for years into the future.

LONDON (Reuters) - For investors trying to call the end of the bull run for stocks, the headline performance of the world's equity markets this year may not be telling the whole story.
Wall Street's S&P 500 is up 2.5 percent continuing its longest bull run in history while the MSCI All-Country World Index, a widely watched gauge of world stock market health, has lost just 5 percent despite fears of a global trade war and a slowdown in China's growth.
But according to data analyzed by Reuters, the proportion of stocks, regions and sectors that are technically in a bear market has shot up since the start of January, prompting some analysts to conclude the bull run may already be over.
(Graphic: Performance year to date and peak to trough - https://tmsnrt.rs/2NWOHFT)
At the start of the year, 9.3 percent of the individual constituents of the S&P 500 index were in a so-called bear market - defined as stocks that have fallen at least 20 percent from their 12-month peak.
By Oct. 22, the percentage had climbed to 34.1 and more than 70 percent of the stocks were in correction territory, defined as a fall of at least 10 percent.
The return of the bears is even more pronounced outside the United States. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), 58 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's global index are now in bear market territory.
In Europe, the STOXX 600 has fallen a limited 9 percent this year, but the percentage of bear market constituents in the index has jumped to 46.2 from 10.2 at the start of 2018.

The concern among some analysts is that the surge in securities hitting the 20 percent loss mark could lead to a tipping point and falls of a similar magnitude in overall indexes - which typically leads to a long-term downward trend.
""It's really an indication that a global bear market has probably already started,"" said Albert Edwards, global strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
He said other technical indicators, such as the breadth of the market - the divergence between individual performances within an index - pointed to the same conclusion.
Such rules of thumb about bear markets are by no means foolproof but they are closely monitored by money managers and investors for whom calling market turns correctly is paramount.
Still, Edwards has a reputation for being a so-called permabear due to his often pessimistic views and other analysts caution that the increase in bear market constituents could be read in two ways.
Either the creeping bear forces a further investor capitulation and long-term funk, or it slowly releases air from what many assumed were bubble-like valuations and eases the pressure to cut and run.
Analysts who side with the second view say the bull market won't run out of steam until the U.S. economy slips into recession.
Many influential investment houses such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) continue to take the view that tax cuts under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. economy's momentum will propel markets further.
""Economic expansion and the long-bull market in equities should continue in 2019,"" the investment bank wrote last week, pointing to rising U.S. corporate sales and profits.

ROTTING FROM THE TAIL 
For the pessimists, the flurry of mini bear markets within catch-all stock market indexes - even among those still showing positive returns this year - is becoming hard to ignore.
Other indexes that have seen a marked rise in bear market constituents include global emerging markets, Chinese shares and European autos and banks. 
In the United States, the Nasdaq 100 - which is up 11 percent this year and whose tech shares have spearheaded the bull market for the past two years - has seen the percentage of its bear market constituents surge to 43.7 from 7.8 in January. 
Some analysts say this suggests that while popular stocks can still thrive, a growing number of stocks are quietly collapsing in the background.
In Germany, the change of fortune has been particularly brutal for the blue-chip DAX. Only two of its 30 stocks were in bear market territory in January but now there are 18.
In Japan's Nikkei, which has only lost 3 percent in 2018, bear market stocks made up 48 percent of the index on Oct. 22, up from just 4.9 percent at the start of the year.

""They say fish rot from the head but in the market's case, it's rotting from the tail onwards,"" said Societe Generale's Edwards.

The bank said on Wednesday that it had agreed the sale of the division to Richard Martin, one of Rothschild's executives, who will get financing for the deal from an un-named investor. 
The financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.
Alexandre de Rothschild, who took over this year as executive chairman of the bank, said: ""Following a strategic review of our private wealth business, we have decided to focus on growing our wealth management operations.""
""In a changing environment, we believe that the trust business can operate more successfully in an independent structure,"" he added.
Services run by Rothschild's trust business include creating and administering structures that hold all of a wealthy client's assets, from companies and intellectual property to art collections and aircraft.
The bank earlier this year reported higher annual profits and revenues, but is facing increasing competition from rivals such as Lazard and Perella Weinberg Partners which is looking to do more business in France.
The Rothschild banking dynasty has worked on some of the biggest deals in history, including helping to finance Britain's war against French military leader Napoleon.

More than $12.8 billion slipped out of U.S.-based equity mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the seven days through Oct. 17, the most recent data available from the trade group showed.
That is the most cash to be withdrawn from those products since late June and came as U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers showed general agreement that further gradual rate hikes would be consistent with the economic expansion, labor market strength and firm inflation that most forecast.

Bond funds recorded withdrawals of $5.6 billion, a second straight week of negative sales for a category that has been enormously popular in recent years but whose returns have faltered as rates rose this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will consider a proposal that would ease rules for all but the nation's largest banks at an Oct. 31 board meeting, the central bank announced on Wednesday.
The proposal, which has yet to be unveiled, would implement several major provisions of a bank deregulation bill Congress passed in May. Most notably, the law directs the Fed to ease oversight of banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets.
The meeting will be cheered by the banking industry, which has been eager to hear from the Fed on how it intends to implement this mandate. 
Randal Quarles, the Fed's top regulatory official, said earlier this month the regulatory package could include more relaxed capital and liquidity rules for smaller, simpler banks, as well as fewer ""stress tests"" of their operations.
Quarles has also suggested tailoring rules for super-regional banks  Capital One  (N:COF), PNC (N:PNC) and US Bancorp (N:USB), that sit above the $250 billion threshold but are still much smaller than the largest global banks.
The rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed by Congress in May raised the threshold by which banks are considered ""systemically risky"" and subject to stricter oversight from $50 billion to $250 billion.

Banks between $50 billion and $100 billion in assets were immediately freed of stricter regulation when it became law.

The companies hope to leverage Grab's 110 million users based on download numbers, and Mastercard's network of 3 million merchant outlets.
""This partnership with Grab significantly advances our reach in Southeast Asia and aligns with our goal of expanding digital payments across all consumers and merchants,"" Mastercard said in the companies' joint statement on Thursday. 
Grab will issue virtual and physical prepaid cards through its app. Customers can top up their cards using cash through agents, drivers and merchants on the GrabPay platform, and will be able to use them at online and offline merchants that accept Mastercard.
Six-year-old Grab, which made its start as a taxi-booking app, is transforming itself into a consumer technology group, offering services such as food and parcel deliveries, micro-loans and mobile payments in one of the world's fastest-growing internet markets - home to some 640 million people.
The region with its large unbanked population has emerged has a financial services battleground for local companies such as Grab, Sea Ltd (N:SE) and Indonesia's Go-Jek, as well as foreign firms including  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700).
Cash remains the most common payment method in Southeast Asia, making the region challenging for e-commerce firms.
""For the first time, these unbanked and under-banked users will be able to use virtual and physical cards to buy things online,"" Reuben Lai, senior managing director, Grab Financial, told Reuters.

Grab and Mastercard said they hope to offer their card in the first half of 2019, starting in Singapore and the Philippines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some tech-heavy U.S. fund managers have turned to the once-stodgy payments sector as an alternative to so-called FANG stocks as high-flyers like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) falter. 
Companies underpinning online shopping and mobile payments, such as  Visa Inc  (N:V), Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL), offer above-average growth at a more reasonable valuation than FANGs and held onto more gains during recent market volatility, fund managers said. 
Visa, for instance, is down 2.9 percent over the last 3 months, compared with a 30 percent plunge in Facebook and Alphabet's 13.5 percent decline. The broad S&P 500 has fallen approximately 4.8 percent over the same time. 
“Right now we’re certainly looking at a test of the past (market) leadership and some of these FANG stocks have gotten ahead of themselves,” said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Equity fund, who recently added a position in  Square Inc  (N:SQ). 
“We’re looking with companies that have high recurring revenue and high growth, and not a lot of companies are in a better spot than the payments space.”
Fund managers from firms including Villere & Co, Plumb Funds, and Ave Maria Mutual Funds said they have moved out of the FANG group of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Alphabet that had led the market this year during the recent volatility because valuations did not appear sustainable.
The fund managers said they see the payments sector as a way to tap into growth in e-commerce and mobile computing at a more attractive multiple than FANGs. 
Amazon trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 160.6, for example, while Visa trades at a P/E of 38.3. 
“You're getting a lot of the same disruption  but at a fraction of the price,” said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co, who has positions in Visa and transaction processing company  Euronet Worldwide  Inc (O:EEFT). Euronet shares are up 33.9 percent for the year. 
Visa and MasterCard in particular are a way to tap into the growth of e-commerce without directly owning online sellers like Amazon, said Brian Milligan, portfolio manager of the Ave Maria Growth fund. 
Online sales are expected to make up 17 percent of all U.S. retail sales by 2022, up from 12.7 percent in 2017, according to Forrester Research. 
""They are benefiting from the same secular growth as Amazon, but they are a duopoly,"" Milligan said. 
Investors have also been moving into payment-focused exchange-traded funds. 
The ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (P:IPAY), a $491 million exchange-traded fund that has PayPal, Visa and  American Express  Co (N:AXP) among its largest holdings, has had positive inflows for all but one week since U.S. stock market volatility started rising in early September, according to Lipper data.
The FANG-heavy Investo QQQ ETF, meanwhile, has posted outflows for 4 out of the past 6 weeks, according to Lipper. 
But while improving U.S. consumer spending and accelerating inflation have helped Visa and Mastercard domestically, mobile payments companies Paytm and Alipay are picking up customers in developing markets like India and China and bypassing Visa and Mastercard's networks, said James Friedman, an analyst at Susquehanna. 
Warren Buffet's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) took a $356 million stake in Paytm in August, while Silicon Valley startup Stripe has signed partnerships with Alipay and WeChat Pay that allows merchants to accept payments from hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. 
""They are more ways to go around the Visa or MasterCard rails in emerging markets, and you have to wonder if their future market share is going to be bigger or smaller,"" Freidman said.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:23PM ET</span>",Top U.S. funds seek sunset rules on dual-class share listings,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - A trade group representing top U.S. pension funds and asset managers, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and T. Rowe Price Group, will ask stock exchanges to limit how long companies may operate with unequal voting rights for shareholders.
The move is meant as a compromise to solve one of the trickiest issues in American corporate governance, said Ken Bertsch, director of the Council of Institutional Investors, based in Washington, D.C., which organized the effort.
Past calls to bar dual-class shares have gone nowhere even as the shareholding structures remain popular in initial public offerings of technology companies and have led to controversies at larger firms including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
Shares of this kind are widely held by big funds despite their concerns that the limited voting rights can lead to insular boards and poor corporate oversight. 
Large investors ""need to participate in the market, so they want a systemic solution"" rather than foregoing shares of particular companies, Bertsch said.
Specifically the trade group will ask New York Stock Exchange parent, Intercontinental Exchange Inc, and Nasdaq Inc to require in their listing standards that companies seeking to go public using multiple share classes with unequal voting rights have plans to equalize them within seven years, according to letters seen by Reuters that the trade group plans to send on Wednesday.
Companies could extend the structures another seven years if authorized by shareholders, voting on an equal basis, under the trade group's proposal. 
“Investors should be allowed to make an informed choice about investing in a company with a multi-class structure,” Nelson Griggs, President of Nasdaq Stock Exchange, said in a statement. Eliminating the choice of using multiple share classes could lead companies to “stay private or sell themselves. Those outcomes preclude retail public investors from participating in the company’s growth.” 
Intercontinental Exchange spokeswoman Lisette Kwong declined to comment. 
In addition to the large asset managers, the Council's membership includes top state pension funds such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Florida State Board of Administration which oversees retirement assets.
The Council has pressed for an end to dual-class systems in the past, and for action by regulators, to little effect so far. Stock index providers have taken a range of stances on the question of whether to include shares of companies with unequal rights. 
The Council's latest effort accepts that some companies with unequal voting rights would continue that way.
Such companies would include cloud-storage provider Dropbox Inc, Snapchat parent  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), and meal-kit maker Blue Apron Holdings Inc, which all have gone public since last year with little or no voting representation for certain investors. 
In all the council said 19 percent of IPOs on U.S. exchanges last year had at least two classes of stock with different voting rights.
Some technology executives argue the unequal structures give business leaders more leeway to focus on long term goals rather than answer to short term Wall Street expectations. 
Critics respond that the setups leave shareholders with little recourse when problems emerge, especially over the longer term. 
The issue came to a head in May at Facebook, where a majority of outside investors backed a measure to revamp its voting structure amid concerns about how the company had handled content and privacy issues, but the vote had no impact given the majority control of voting rights by company founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
In a statement provided by the Council, BlackRock co-founder and vice chairman Barbara Novick said that ""BlackRock believes that equal voting rights are a fundamental tenet of good corporate governance.""
Donna Anderson, head of corporate governance at T. Rowe Price, said in an interview there are signs that time limits for multiple share classes will catch on. She cited a growing number of IPOs with the feature and supportive comments about such limits from U.S. SEC commissioner Robert Jackson in February.

""We’re in a potentially unique moment of consensus,"" she said.

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>","In a Market Meltdown, Trump May Complicate the Fed's Response","(Bloomberg) -- Investors are confident that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is independent of political influence. Yet President Donald Trump’s criticism of Jerome Powell and his rate increases isn’t making things any easier for the Fed chair as stock prices tumble.
Tumult in equities and tightening financial conditions have altered the course of Fed policy before, most recently in 2016, when the central bank signaled four rate hikes for that year and then only carried out one. For now, the Fed hasn’t suggested that tumbling shares risk altering its tightening plans. However, Trump’s badgering doesn’t create the best optics if officials do want to potentially pause should confidence in the markets and the economic outlook deteriorate markedly.
Trump stepped up his attacks on Powell on Tuesday, saying he “maybe” regrets appointing him. The president also said he’s intentionally sending a direct message that he wants lower rates. The criticism by Trump -- who’s previously touted equities gains as evidence of his success -- seems to align with slides in the S&P 500 Index.
“Trump is very politically savvy,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “If the stock market sells off he’s got a target -- it’s the Fed’s fault. And if the Fed does begin to pause then Trump will be able to claim it as a victory. This puts Powell in a no-win situation.”
In September, the Fed lifted rates for the sixth time since Trump took office, although it was the first move since the president began complaining about Powell. Officials are signaling another hike this year and three more in 2019. Trump’s hardly the first president to pressure Fed chairs to keep rates low. Both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did so.
Gauging the Sell-off
The S&P 500 has dropped almost 8 percent since peaking in September, still short of the 10 percent threshold that classically defines a correction. Still, the current sell-off concerns some investors because of the persistence of the losses. Since last month’s high, stocks have dropped roughly twice the frequency of the last three corrections.
Back in 2016, stocks got off to an ugly start. From the end of December, the S&P 500 fell 12 percent before bottoming in February. Fed officials wound up backing off plans for more aggressive rate hikes amid the financial-market turmoil, which was triggered by concern over slowing Chinese growth. Inflation was also running too low at the time.
“The Fed should be of strong enough character that regardless of what the president is saying about them, that if it’s the right policy to change course then they should change course,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC.
‘Back Channels’
Powell has time before having to make any tough decisions. The S&P 500 would have to fall 15 to 20 percent to raise the odds of the Fed altering policy, according to Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.
Absent a Fed shift, it’s Trump himself who could act as a catalyst for the market, depending on whether he moves to ease trade tensions. Yet his “market sensitivity does not mean that Trump will make significant policy changes on any topic including trade based upon short-term market volatility,” Guha wrote.
Money-market traders have already trimmed bets on how many rate increases they see over the next year. That, combined with haven buying, have pushed the benchmark 10-year yield down to 3.12 percent, from a seven-year high of 3.26 percent touched Oct. 9.
The market has to understand “that this is fluid and the president’s comments are not unusual from the White House,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU). “But it’s usually in essence kept at the White House and sent through back channels to the Fed.”"
1593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Stock Rout Deepens; Nasdaq Flirts With Correction: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- The sell-off in U.S. stocks picked up steam as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth. Treasuries rallied for a second day on demand for haven assets.
The S&P 500 Index extended its October rout to 7.4 percent, reducing this year’s gain for the benchmark index to less than 1 percent. Disappointing earnings from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) drove declines in the communications and semiconductor groups, offsetting a promising outlook from Boeing (NYSE:BA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 300 points, and the Nasdaq Composite Index flirted with a correction from it’s record closing high in August.
Amid the flood of earnings that will bring reports from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) later Wednesday and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday, economic data continues to underwhelm, particularly on the rate-sensitive housing front. New home sales sank again, sending battered homebuilders lower. Fragile market sentiment is also working through reports that potential bombs were sent to two former U.S. presidents and the New York headquarters of CNN.
“There’s just right now a heightened sensitivity to what can go wrong,” Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward D. Jones & Co., said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “So we will have more of these days where stocks move a lot within the day as everyone’s trying to sort through what do today’s reports mean.”
European politics is also in focus, with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte doubling down on his government’s budget and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet descending into conflict. The pound weakened, and the region’s bonds rallied. The euro dropped following disappointing manufacturing data. Retailers were the biggest winners in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A turnaround in China’s markets helped the MSCI Asia Pacific Index avoid a bear market even as it edged down.
“Right now markets are still trying to reprice,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance. “What’s happening with earnings is exaggerating market moves.”
Elsewhere, oil rebounded after touching the lowest in almost two-months on a pledge by Saudi Arabia to meet any shortfall that materializes from Iranian sanctions. Emerging-market currencies and shares were mostly lower.

1599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Technical Pieces May Be Aligning for S&P 500 Bottom Near 2,700","(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index’s drop to its lowest level in nearly five months could be a sign of better days ahead, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). technical strategist Jason Hunter.
“The break to new correction lows puts the pieces in place for a bottom,” Hunter wrote in a note. “We expect any residual weakness to find buying interest below 2,700.”
The S&P 500 tumbled as much as 2.3 percent to 2,691.43 Tuesday, its lowest intraday level since May 29, before rallying back to close down 0.6 percent at 2,740.69. Today, the gauge fell as low as 2,703.33 before bouncing back again, though it was still on track for its sixth straight negative close.
Hunter still expects a fourth-quarter rally that could reach new cycle highs into early 2019. In that, he’s joined by Evercore ISI technical analyst Rich Ross, who said the setup exists for an inflection higher, calling yesterday’s move a “classic drawdown to support” and noting extreme oversold conditions as well as a period of strong seasonality in which stocks tend to go higher.
Dennis Gartman, publisher of The Gartman Letter, also sees the 2,700 level as key for the S&P 500. He believes it is support “for now,” though questions whether that can last. But he said a bounce back toward the 2,820-2,850 range is “reasonable.”
Piper Jaffray sounded a note of caution, focusing on the fact that the benchmark closed yesterday below its 200-day moving average as a “major red flag for investors.”
“The technical environment for U.S. equities remains challenging as recent volatility severely damaged market breadth and momentum,” Piper Jaffray’s Craig Johnson and Adam Turnquist wrote in a note published before the market open today. “Based on the overall technical evidence, we see building risk for further downside and recommend investors proceed with caution. In terms of support, we are watching the October lows followed by the 2,692-2,700 range and 2,677.”
JPMorgan is watching the mid-2,700s as possible confirmation on the direction.
“The S&P 500 Index break to a new correction low and test of the 2,674-2,693 support zone triggered bullish momentum divergence signals on the intraday time frames,” JPMorgan’s Hunter wrote. “A move through 2,755-2,768 resistance would confirm a short-term trend reversal and turn our attention to the 2,816-2,826 and 2,865 resistance layers.”

Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) was a big drag on the chip stocks after it guided fourth-quarter profit and revenue below consensus after the bell yesterday. That led to a host of price-target cuts from sell-side analysts as the company said demand fell in most markets. Its shares dropped about 4%.
 STMicroelectronics NV  NYSE:STM) also hit the sector with downside guidance on revenue. Its shares tumbled about 11%.
The grim view on semi stocks as a whole hit heavyweight Advanced Micro Devices hard, even though the company is still to report earnings after the bell today.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shares fell about 5%.
Looking to entertainment, Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock fell about 3%.

1619,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Decline Deepens on Peak-Profit Concerns,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks extended losses for a sixth day, led by declines in communication services and technology companies, as concern lingers that profit growth has peaked and tariffs weigh on optimism. The dollar strengthened as a weaker-than-expected manufacturing gauge reading in Europe helped undercut the euro.
The S&P 500 Index traded near the lows of the day, hurt as disappointing earnings from AT&T (NYSE:T) Corp. and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average got an initial boost before fading after its biggest component by weighting, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., rallied on a positive profit forecast. Shares of home builders slumped after new home sales fell more than expected, showing that the consequences of higher interest rates are trickling down to the consumer.
“There’s just right now a heightened sensitivity to what can go wrong,” Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward D. Jones & Co., said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “So we will have more of these days where stocks move a lot within the day as everyone’s trying to sort through what do today’s reports mean.”
The pound weakened on Brexit worries, and European bonds followed Treasuries higher. The euro dropped following disappointing manufacturing data.
Sentiment remains fragile as global shares chart a course for the worst month in more than three years. The cautious mood was further damped by renewed worries over the impact of tariffs after industrial bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). warned about rising costs due to higher steel prices. European politics is also in focus, with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte doubling down on his government’s budget and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet descending into conflict.
Retailers were the biggest winners in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A turnaround in China’s markets helped the MSCI Asia Pacific Index avoid a bear market even as it edged down.
“Right now markets are still trying to reprice,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance. “What’s happening with earnings is exaggerating market moves.”
Elsewhere, oil rebounded after touching the lowest in almost two-months on a pledge by Saudi Arabia to meet any shortfall that materializes from Iranian sanctions. Emerging-market currencies and shares climbed.

1625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Chip Stocks Extend Worst Rout in Decade as Slowdown Fears Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- This month’s rout in semiconductor stocks is now on pace to be the worst in a decade after disappointing guidance from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc.
Texas Instruments, which has the largest number of customers and the broadest product range in the chip industry, warned that demand is slowing across many of its markets. That was bad news for investors who had already seen anxieties about a sales slowdown erase about 10 percent from the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in October. The index fell another 2.3 percent at 9:52 a.m. in New York and is now on track for its biggest monthly decline since November 2008.
“We’re heading into a softer market,” Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said on the Texas Instruments earnings call. The company plans to respond by being disciplined in its operating plans and reduce wafer production to avoid oversupply.
Deteriorating bookings and an upturn in cancellations could pose a threat to semiconductor peers, as well, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note. Rolland, who carries a positive rating on Texas Instruments, cites Maxim Integrated Products Inc (NASDAQ:MXIM), ON Semiconductor Corp., NXP Semiconductors, Cypress Semiconductor, Knowles and Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) Inc. among the chipmakers that “may fare worse.”
Texas Instrument’s “guidance bodes poorly for the group, particularly as their low lead-times and consignment programs were supposed to make them more cycle resistant than most,” Rolland writes. “We worry for the lesser operators.”
Texas Instruments fell as much as 7 percent Wednesday to its lowest intraday price in a year. MKS Instruments, which supplies gear used in semiconductor production, looked to add to the bad news with a fourth-quarter revenue forecast that missed the lowest analyst estimate. Shares of MKS tumbled as much as 7.5 percent before turning higher.
Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, gave a disappointing revenue forecast.

1631,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Sees Technical Pieces in Place for a Bottom on S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index’s drop Tuesday to its lowest level in nearly five months could be a sign of better days ahead, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). technical strategist Jason Hunter.
“The break to new correction lows puts the pieces in place for a bottom,” Hunter wrote in a note. “We expect any residual weakness to find buying interest below 2,700.”
The S&P 500 tumbled as much as 2.3 percent to 2,691.43 yesterday, its lowest intraday level since May 29, before rallying back to close down 0.6 percent at 2,740.69.
Hunter still expects a fourth-quarter rally that could reach new cycle highs into early 2019.
Dennis Gartman, publisher of The Gartman Letter, also sees the 2,700 level as key for the S&P 500. He believes it is support “for now,” though questions whether that can last. But he thinks a bounce back toward the 2,820-2,850 range is “reasonable.”
“The S&P 500 Index break to a new correction low and test of the 2,674-2,693 support zone triggered bullish momentum divergence signals on the intraday time frames,” JPMorgan’s Hunter wrote. “A move through 2,755-2,768 resistance would confirm a short-term trend reversal and turn our attention to the 2,816-2,826 and 2,865 resistance layers.”

But now that China and Hong Kong are back with a vengeance, the regional benchmark is inching higher in the green.
Asia’s main equity gauge, which was poised to succumb to bear market territory earlier, is now up 0.3 percent as of 12:45 p.m. in Singapore as the indexes for China and Hong Kong rallied by the mid-day trading break. Even U.S. stock-index futures have flipped into a slightly higher region.
It’s worth noting that Chinese stocks might be in a bit of a “one step forward, two steps back” mode as the market holds on to its title of world’s wildest market. While there have been some days of solid rallies over the past couple of months, the Shanghai Composite Index is still down about 20 percent since the end of December. The only caveat is that China’s national team might just be waking up to heavier support for the rest of the year.
First a recap on what happened overnight:
Where to from here? Earnings season will be key. All eyes will be on U.S. tech stocks this week as companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google’s Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). are scheduled to report this week.
Everywhere else in Asia, stock markets are seeing modest gains. In India, the S&P BSE Sensex climbed, propelled by the steepest oil drop in three months. Japan’s Topix index fluctuated as explorers of crude slid and electronics stocks rose. Japan investors may be waiting for earnings to kick into full gear -- the ratio of short bets on shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed to a record of 50.8 percent as the Topix closed on Tuesday at its lowest level since September 2017.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 10:41PM ET</span>","Asia stocks struggle as global woes persist, oil near two-month lows","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged lower on Wednesday as concerns, ranging from worries about U.S. corporate earnings to Middle East tensions, weighed on sentiment while crude oil approached two-month lows after Saudi Arabia flagged possible supply increases.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, extending the decline of more than 2 percent in the previous session.
Global stocks have suffered this week on worries about U.S. earnings, Italian government finances, U.S. trade tensions and mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia over the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia's diplomatic standing looked increasingly precarious as Turkey dismissed the kingdom's efforts to blame Khashoggi's death on rogue operatives while U.S. President Donald Trump said Riyadh staged the ""worst cover-up ever.""
Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.3 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.6 percent.
South Korea's KOSPI slipped 0.25 percent and Japan's Nikkei lost 0.35 percent, handing back earlier gains.
Equity losses in the region were modest, however, after a late round of buying helped Wall Street indexes pare most of their earlier panic-driven losses.
Wall Street's three major indexes slumped early on Tuesday but ended well off the day's lows as investors snapped up beaten-down shares late in the session.
""Broader market sentiment remains fragile, but as last night's resilience by Wall Street shows, sentiment has not broken down completely,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""We may see more bouts of 'mini panic' until the U.S. midterm elections, but the bottom line is that the U.S. economy is in good shape and that should prevent sentiment from breaking down.""
The dollar flagged against the yen, which is often sought in times of risk aversion. The U.S. currency was at 112.49 yen after dropping 0.35 percent overnight.
The greenback was also weighed by a decline in Treasury yields, as the recent risk aversion drove investors to safe haven government bonds. The 10-year Treasury note yield was at 3.158 percent after stooping to a three-week low of 3.111 on Tuesday.
The Canadian dollar shook off the plunge in oil and stood firm against its U.S. counterpart as investors maintained bets that the Bank of Canada (BoC) will hike interest rates later on Wednesday.
The Canadian dollar stood little changed at C$1.3083 per dollar after gaining 0.1 percent the previous day.
""We do not believe that the declines in the markets so far are enough to dissuade either the Fed or the BoC from continuing to hike interest rates, as soon as today in the case of the BoC,"" wrote Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics.
""However, markets will start to rethink the need for tighter policy if global equity markets go off the rails.""
China's yuan added to the previous day's modest gains and rose to 6.9369 per dollar in onshore trade, continuing its modest pull-back from a near two-year low of 6.9445 marked on Monday.
The pound was little changed at $1.2976 and near a three-week trough of $1.2937 brushed overnight.
Sterling briefly gained half a percent against the dollar on Tuesday after a media report that the European Union could offer British Prime Minister Theresa May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.
The pound's strength was fleeting, however, a sign the market remains unconvinced May can successfully sell any deal to her Conservative party colleagues and get it through parliament.
The euro was steady at $1.1463 after nudging up 0.05 percent the previous day.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was flat at 96.979 after posting a modest loss the previous day.
In commodities, U.S. crude futures traded at $66.41 per barrel after dropping roughly 4 percent on Tuesday to a two-month low of $65.74.
Brent crude futures traded at $76.53 per barrel after dropping more than 4 percent on Tuesday to $75.88, their lowest since Sept. 7.
Crude slid after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed, easing concerns ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran. 

The recent sell-off in global equities has also raised worries about slowing growth curbing demand for crude.

Anning Chen, a former chairman of Chery Jaguar Land Rover in China and who also worked for Ford previously, will become the U.S. automaker's new CEO from Nov. 1.
The move comes at a pivotal time for Ford which has seen China sales slide sharply this year. Sales in September tumbled 43 percent.
""Success in China is critical as we reposition our global business for long-term success,"" Ford CEO Jim Hackett said in a statement.
Ford China will also become a stand-alone business unit, reporting directly to global headquarters. Chen will report to Jim Farley, president of global markets.
""As the largest vehicle market in the world, China commands its own leadership and focus,"" said Farley, adding the reorganization would increase the speed of decision-making and help the firm be closer to customers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  LG Display  Co Ltd (KS:034220) posted a 76 percent fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday compared with a year earlier, after two quarters of consecutive losses, helped by higher seasonal panel prices.
The Apple Inc (O:AAPL) supplier said operating profit was 140 billion won ($123.2 million) for the July-September quarter, beating an average forecast of 79 billion won from 10 analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll. 
Recovering Liquid-Crystal Display (LCD) prices ahead of the year-end holiday period boosted the bottom line but the firm said the trend was not expected to continue into the fourth quarter.
Revenue fell 12 percent from a year earlier to 6.1 trillion won.
The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) TV panel business turned to profit in the third quarter, supported by sales volume growth. The firm did not disclose the size of the profit.
Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Securities, said its costly OLED business was not doing enough to shore up profit, and prices of some panels had already begun to fall.
""Demand will go down again after the holiday season in the fourth quarter is over,"" Eo said.

Prices for 50-inch (127 cm) LCD television panels began to rebound in August to $117 after hitting a record low of $109 in June, according to data provider WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 08:17PM ET</span>",Union Pacific to cut 475 jobs in first wave of planned reductions,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Railroad operator  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) said on Tuesday it would cut 475 jobs in the fourth quarter and signaled more workforce reductions to come as it seeks to boost profitability by the end of 2020.
Union Pacific, which connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the United States, in April warned it was unlikely to achieve its profitability target in 2019 due to service problems and congestion on its rail network.
In a memo, Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific said it also would eliminate 200 contract positions. 
At year-end, the railroad had nearly 42,000 employees, about 85 percent of whom were represented by 14 major railroad unions.
The latest staff reductions will be across the network and affect both union and non-union workers. Union Pacific said the cuts are ""the first of what likely will be additional workforce reduction initiatives through 2020.""
Additional cost-cutting efforts include consolidating a variety of operations and selling Selma Farm, a corporate retreat it acquired as part of its 1986 merger with Missouri Pacific. 
""These steps are part of reducing our general and administrative support structure by roughly 30 percent by 2020,"" Chairman Lance Fritz said in the memo to employees.
Union Pacific is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Thursday.
The company aims to reduce its operating ratio, a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and a closely watched gauge of railroad performance, to at least 60 percent by the end of 2020. Railroads boost profits by lowering their operating ratio. 
Union Pacific's second-quarter operating ratio was up 1.1 points to 63 percent versus a year ago, due to higher fuel and labor costs. 
The company on Oct. 1 rolled out a ""Precision Scheduled Railroading"" plan to improve efficiency and ease congestion.
That strategy was pioneered by the late Hunter Harrison, who led the turnarounds of two Canadian railroads before joining CSX Corp (O:CSX) last year. 
CSX executives stuck with the strategy after Harrison's death in December. Last week, CSX reported an operating ratio of 58.7 percent for the third quarter. 

Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF are the largest U.S. freight rail operators with annual revenues of more than $20 billion each.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:25PM ET</span>","Despite climate pledges, China struggles to break coal habit","By David Stanway
XUZHOU, China (Reuters) - In a former mining district in eastern China, authorities have shut dozens of pits and invested billions of yuan to resculpt the broken landscape, creating gardens, forest walks and wetland parks, as well as a small museum dedicated to coal.
""There were many villages specializing in running coal mines and when the mines were shut down we lost around four-fifths of our income - we were under huge economic pressure,"" said Meng Qinqxi, a senior Communist Party official in Mazhuang, a village on the outskirts of the heavy industrial city of Xuzhou.
""This problem is not ours alone... but a national policy, and no one can resist it."" 
Xuzhou, in the Yangtze River delta manufacturing hub of Jiangsu, shut its coal pits a decade ago after 130 years of mining, one of many districts to stop producing the filthiest of fossil fuels in line with central government directives.
But despite an unprecedented surge of investment in alternative energies, together with caps on coal use and the establishment of ""no-coal zones"" throughout the country, China's overall consumption and production are again rising. 
When U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord last year, China reaffirmed its commitments to tackle the problem of coal, by far the biggest source of its climate-warming carbon emissions.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a landmark report this month that ""unprecedented"" changes were needed to keep global temperature rises to within 1.5 degrees Celsius, including profound cuts in burning coal.
China has made efforts to cut the share of coal in total energy use, with the figure expected to drop to 58 percent by 2020, down more than 10 percentage points in a decade. It has also already met a 2020 target to cut the amount of carbon dioxide it emits per unit of growth. 
But the absolute volumes of both coal and CO2 remain by far the world's highest, and are still set to rise.
Though some studies have suggested total CO2 emissions peaked at 9.53 gigatonnes in 2013, well ahead of its official target of ""around 2030"", environmental group Greenpeace says they could reach a new high this year or next. Coal production has also risen 5.1 percent in the first three-quarters of this year to 2.59 billion tonnes.
Falling coal demand after 2013, as the economy slowed, lumbered China's massive coal sector with a huge supply glut and crippling debts. Giant miners such as China Shenhua Energy (SS:601088) sought to transition into alternative energies amid forecasts of a structural decline in coal use. 
But fortunes have recovered rapidly since 2016, when state efforts to shed excess capacity coincided with a revival in demand. Shenhua's profits nearly doubled in 2017, while net earnings at rival  Yanzhou Coal  (SS:600188) surged more than 200 percent compared with the previous year.
""China embarked on an energy transformation in terms of cutting coal and developing renewables, but we are now facing difficulties on both fronts,"" said Li Shuo, senior climate advisor with Greenpeace. 
OUTPUT STILL RISING
Big coal-producing regions such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi have been under pressure to cap capacity, and the state promised to shut 500 million tonnes of annual production between 2016 and 2020. It also banned the import and use of lower-quality coal. 
But despite closing uneconomical pits, official annual production capability rose to 3.491 billion tonnes by the end of June, up from 3.41 billion tonnes a year earlier, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said this month. Another 976 million tonnes were under construction.
Closures have been offset by rises in output elsewhere. Though all collieries in Xuzhou have closed, the city's main mining firm continues to produce large volumes of coal, coal chemicals and coal-fired power, running projects elsewhere in China as well as Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The Xuzhou Mining Group produced 24 million tonnes of coal last year, up 6.7 percent on the year. 
And while provinces such as Hebei and Shandong have set targets to cut coal use and convert heating systems to cleaner natural gas, others are still approving new coal-fired power plants.
Coal-fired power has remained the cheapest and most readily available option for many local governments, with many already struggling to find enough natural gas to supply local houses with heat. 
China's mainly coal-fired thermal power capacity rose 58 gigawatts (GW) from the end of 2016 to the end of August this year, more than half of all new domestic capacity over the period and almost enough to power Australia, NEA data showed.
According to the China Electricity Council, China added 38.55 GW of coal-fired power capacity in 2017 alone, down 1.42 gigawatts compared with 2016 but still more than the country's entire nuclear reactor fleet.
NO NEW NUCLEAR 
Beijing's ""decarbonisation"" plans have been hit by grid bottlenecks and subsidy backlogs that have impeded efforts to maximize solar and wind generation. Solar capacity grew by a record 53 GW in 2017, but additions are capped at 30 GW this year. 
They have also been hurt by a slowdown in the construction of nuclear reactors, one of the few alternative power sources that can provide the reliable ""baseload"" generation role currently played by traditional coal-fired plants.
""With renewables ramping up so quickly, it has given the illusion of decarbonisation, but China is falling into the same trap that Germany has fallen into - deploying lots of renewables that have to be backed up with lots of coal-fired power plants,"" said Li Ning, nuclear scientist and dean of the College of Energy at Xiamen University. 
With no new commercial reactors approved in nearly three years, local authorities have had little choice but to turn to more cheaper and more reliable coal to provide the baseload.
China pledged to launch another six to eight reactor projects this year, but Li said it was unlikely it would get around to making the required approvals until next year. 

""If nuclear can't keep up, then it is coal,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's listed companies must spell out how Brexit could hit their business and not pad out annual reports with generic concerns, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said on Wednesday.
After the failure of construction firm Carillion earlier this year, the FRC is under political pressure to crack the whip on poor reporting. Its powers to bring auditors to heel are being reviewed after lawmakers said its response to Carillion was ""timid"".
The accounting regulator reviewed 220 company reports for 2017/2018 and found companies taking different approaches to reporting on risks arising from Britain's planned departure from the European Union next March.
Paul George, executive director of corporate governance and reporting at the FRC, said Britain faces challenges with corporate reporting after Brexit.
""Companies should therefore do more to meet the expectations of the market and society in order for the UK to maintain its position as an attractive home for global capital,"" George said.
Britain and the EU have said they want a divorce settlement and transition deal in place by March, but companies are being urged to have contingency plans in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Companies should distinguish in their next annual report between specific and direct challenges to business models from Brexit, and broader economic uncertainties, the FRC said.
Threats like changes to import and export taxes, or delays to supply chains, should be ""clearly identified and for management to describe any actions they are taking, or have taken, to manage the potential impact,"" the FRC said in an open letter to finance directors and chairs of audit committees.
""In some circumstances this may mean recognizing or remeasuring certain items in the balance sheet."" 
Even after the annual report has been signed off by auditors around December, firms should still disclose any additional information in annual reports when published, the FRC said.
""It will be for companies to decide whether Brexit uncertainties impact their statements on viability and even their ability to continue as a going concern,"" it added.
It also said it will start looking at whether annual reports in general are still useful given the increased amount of information on companies available from analysts and other sources.

The Minneapolis-based retailer will offer free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items from Nov. 1 to Dec. 22 with no order minimum or membership required. Target had announced the shipping service in March. 
Target's two-day shipping option is less expensive than Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's, which requires an annual subscription fee of $119 under its Prime membership service. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc offers free two-day shipping for a minimum order of $35.
Target will also expand its Drive Up Service, which allows customers to place orders online and have packages brought to their cars by the retailer's employees. It will include nearly 1,000 stores by the end of October, ahead of schedule. 
The company currently fulfills about 50 percent of its digital orders from inventory at its stores and plans to increase that to 90 percent.
Target will also offer same-day delivery on 55,000 items with Shipt, a company it bought for $550 million last year, in ""hundreds of markets."" Shipt will offer the service in 200 markets, up from 160 announced earlier.
The biggest changes the retailer has made to its business over the past five years have been on order fulfillment, the final mile of delivering orders from a warehouse or store to shoppers' homes, Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. 
The offerings will be part of the ""Target Run and Done"" holiday promotional campaign.
Cornell also said Target's holiday hiring plans are on schedule. The retailer has received over 100,000 applications in a tight labor market and is seeing a 40 percent rise in job applications for its warehouses. In September, Target said it would hire 120,000 seasonal workers at wages starting at $12 an hour. The company has made a commitment to go up to $15 an hour by 2020.
Last week, Target said it will dedicate nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 stores, seeking more holiday toy sales after retailer Toys ""R"" Us Inc went bankrupt this year. Target had said its shoppers will be able to shop for more than 2,500 new and exclusive toys.
Rival Walmart Inc has made a similar push for gaining market share in toys.
In August, Target reported its strongest comparable store sales growth in 13 years and said a strong economy lifted customer visits to the most in a decade. 
U.S. holiday sales in 2018 will increase by 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent from a year ago, when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to The National Retail Federation.

The trade body said holiday sales growth will be higher than an average increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years but slower than last year's 5.3 percent gain, when consumer spending grew the most since 2005, boosted by tax cuts.

A spokesman for EDL confirmed the firm was relocating from the UK and said it planned to shift its headquarters to Switzerland.
So-called macro hedge funds bet on macroeconomic events and trends using currencies, bonds, rates and stock futures.
De Langlade, a former Moore Capital trader, launched the firm in September 2015.
The $779 million EDL Global Opportunities Fund was up 3 percent in the year to Oct. 5 after gains of 6 percent in 2017, according to data compiled by HSBC.
That compared to the average macro hedge fund, which was down 1.8 percent in the year to end-September after returns of 2.2 percent in 2017, data from industry tracker hedge fund research showed.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 05:27PM ET</span>",Caterpillar tries to allay earnings concerns after shares tank,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) tried on Tuesday to ease mounting concerns about China and global demand after it affirmed its 2018 profit estimate, a move that investors feared signaled a cap in earnings growth and sparked a sell-off in its shares.
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company has boosted the full-year profit outlook twice in the first two quarters of this year. That had built hopes of yet another upgrade. But the company retained its 2018 adjusted profit forecast of $11.00 to $12.00 per share, saying nothing material had changed since the last revision in July.
The move came days after China reported the weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis, and the International Monetary Fund cut the global growth outlook for 2018 and 2019.
The industrial bellwether, however, said it expected the Chinese market to remain healthy, leading to a 40 percent annual increase in industry sales for standard full-size excavators this year.
""We are very comfortable with the outlook for China,"" Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in an interview. ""We still expect to have another good year in China.""
Bonfield said the world's second largest economy accounts for 10-15 percent of CAT's construction equipment sales and 5-10 percent of total company sales.
In the latest quarter, nonresidential building and infrastructure activities in China powered a 19 percent jump in Caterpillar's construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
Dealers in China posted one of the biggest inventory increases of Caterpillar products in the third quarter, the company said.
A VICTIM OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS
The bullish comments helped Caterpillar shares recover from the worst sell-off since at least April, but the stock was still down 7 percent at $119.67 late Tuesday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which includes Caterpillar, also pared early losses and was down 32.48 points.
""Most investors are working with the base case scenario of a recession sometime in either 2019 or 2020,"" said Rizk Maidi, an analyst at equity research firm Berenberg in London. ""People are just hunting for any data point to confirm that the earnings have peaked.""
Elizabeth Vermillion, an analyst at CFRA Research, said the company was also becoming a victim of high expectations after its profits topped Wall Street estimates in all of the last nine reporting periods.
For the third quarter, adjusted profit per share came in at $2.86, up from $1.95, last year. Analysts on average had expected $2.85 a share, according to Refinitiv.
OUTLOOK
Caterpillar shares are down over 25 percent since late January as U.S.-China trade tensions intensified and raw material and freight costs soared for local manufacturers. Shares of other major industrials, including 3M Co (N:MMM), are also in ""bear market"" territory, down 20 percent or more from their highs.
CAT said most of its end markets are continuing to improve, helping it post higher sales across the three primary business segments.
Maidi said Caterpillar's earnings still have room to grow as its revenues are 25 percent off their 2012 peak.
On Tuesday, Bonfield asked investors to expect smaller profit increases.
""There does come a time when you grow at more normal levels,"" Bonfield said. Profit grew 47 percent in the third quarter, sharply lower than 99 percent and 120 percent jumps in the second and first quarter, respectively.
Caterpillar also acknowledged an increase in manufacturing costs in the latest quarter due to elevated freight costs, and higher steel prices and import tariffs. 
It said tariffs would cost it about $40 million in the latest quarter. However, for the full year, it estimated the impact to be at the low end of the previous forecast of $100 million to $200 million.

To offset the rising input cost, it will raise prices of its machines and engines by 1 to 4 percent globally from January 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after worries about the earnings outlook added to recent selling pressure, though major indexes ended well off the day's lows as investors snapped up beaten-down shares late in the session.
Shares of  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) tumbled 7.6 percent after the heavy-equipment maker maintained its 2018 earnings forecast, following forecast increases in the previous two quarters. 
3M (NYSE:MMM) Co slid 4.4 percent after cutting its full-year profit outlook due to foreign currency-related challenges.
That reignited worries over the impact of rising borrowing costs, wages and tariffs on corporate profits and caused S&P industrial stocks to slide 1.6 percent.
Along with worries over profit growth, concerns over the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections and Italy's budget have also sent investors scrambling out of stocks.
The S&P 500 energy index fell 2.7 percent, the most of any sector, as oil prices plunged after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed.
Investors trimmed most of the losses in afternoon trading as some thought the losses were overdone. Technical buying at support levels around 2,700 on the S&P 500 also helped stocks to bounce back, strategists said.
""There was a lot of early morning fear, and when the market didn't accelerate further to the downside, you saw some people coming in to pick up some stocks,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
The day's earnings disappointments aside, he said, technology earnings later this week could be upbeat. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all are due to report this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,191.43, the S&P 500 lost 15.19 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,740.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.09 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,437.54. 
The S&P 500 has declined for five straight sessions and is now down 6.5 percent from its record closing high on Sept. 20. 
The Nasdaq again flirted with correction territory, falling more than 10 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high before paring losses to end off those levels.
Earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased about 22 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, though 2018 is seen as a peak for the profit cycle, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Among gainers, McDonald's rose 6.3 percent after it beat estimates for quarterly same-store sales on strong demand in international markets, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) rallied 4.1 percent after it beat estimates for profit and net new phone subscribers. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 86 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded nine new highs and 382 new lows.

About 9.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The subpoenas were received from both the civil and criminal divisions of the Department of Justice, while the inquiries came from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other agencies, the company said in a regulatory filing.
AmEx's foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) unit offers cross-border payments services mainly to small and middle market business customers in five countries, including the United States.
Pricing practices within AmEx's FXIP unit were being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.
AmEx said in Tuesday's filing it was reviewing FXIP's pricing practices with an outside law firm.

FXIP accounts for less than 1 percent of AmEx's total revenue, and the investigation will not have a serious impact on overall operations or results, the company said.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>",Tariffs begin to take bite out of U.S. corporate earnings growth,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The easy money may be over.
U.S. company earnings growth is slowing after a bumper start to the year, and the reality of an escalating trade war between two of the world's largest economies is starting to weigh on companies ranging from  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) to  Ford Motor Co .
While earnings growth is still high at 22 percent so far this quarter, the amount by which S&P 500 index companies are beating analyst estimates is nearly half of what it was during the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data. 
Along with rising interest rates which are making bonds more attractive, slower earnings growth is eroding investor sentiment and contributed to Tuesday's sharp sell in equities globally. 
""These trade tensions are coming home to roost and they are impacting the fundamentals of the market,"" said Tally Leger, equity strategist at OppenheimerFunds. ""Thanks to trade tariffs we are facing the headwinds of a stronger dollar, higher oil prices, and rising interest rates."" 
President Donald Trump has lauded the U.S. stock market's rise during his presidency, but the market volatility comes at an inopportune time just two weeks before midterm congressional elections.
Trump has focused on global trade policy in an attempt to revive U.S. manufacturing. 
But Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment maker, said before the U.S. market opened on Tuesday that Trump's steel import tariffs, along with higher freight charges, cost it about $40 million in its most recent quarter. Shares of the company were down nearly 8.0 percent in mid-day trading.
""The trade tensions are indeed pressuring corporate earnings and we possibly have been seeing a peak in earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. As a result, high market valuations could mean investors are not willing to pay as much for a company's earnings, he said. 
The forward price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 index was 16.2 as of Monday, down from a 2018 peak of 18.5 on January 22, according to Refinitiv data. At the same time, U.S. companies are on pace to purchase more than $1 trillion of their own stock this year, according to TrimTabs Investment Research, and lower valuations could lure them to buy more.
TAX COUNTERWEIGHT 
The $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by the Republican party controlled Congress in December 2017 boosted corporate earnings earlier this year, and encouraged companies to repatriate cash parked overseas, but the tax cuts are now being offset by costs resulting from the new import tariffs, analysts said. 
Among companies citing tariffs as a negative factor, 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co saw its shares fall nearly 6.0 percent after its sales fell below forecasts by the most in 2 years and after it cut its earnings estimates due to a slowdown in China and rising tariff costs. 
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which is expected to report its earnings on Wednesday, said in late September that steel tariffs have already cost the company $1 billion in profits.
Overall, the earnings growth rate of S&P 500 index companies peaked in the first quarter of this year at 26.6 percent, according to Refinitiv data. 
The third quarter is currently on pace for a 22.1 percent growth rate, while earnings growth is expected to slide to a 9.0 percent increase in the second quarter of next year as companies face tougher comparisons due to the tax cut boost in 2018. Other concerns for earnings include the stronger U.S. dollar and rising interest rates.
Declining profit outlooks by other large companies could accelerate the sell-off, said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 

""Today you have got some big earnings misses and I think that has led investors to be concerned about will we continue to see solid earnings growth, especially with companies having beat the expectations but now saying the future doesn't look quite as good,"" she said.

1687,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. AT&T, Boeing, UPS Lead Tomorrow’s Earnings
There’s no slowing down with earnings tomorrow morning.
Among closely-watched names will be Boeing (NYSE:BA) and UPS (NYSE:UPS), with earnings from both companies expected to rise from the year-ago period.
Investors will look to Boeing’s results for any indications of increased input costs, as seen by fellow Dow component  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT). And UPS’ earnings will give some more color on how companies with exposure to China are faring during trade battles.
AT&T (NYSE:T) will report a day after rival Verizon (NYSE:VZ) topped subscriber numbers. But investors may be more interested in the company’s content plans with Time Warner than how much the new iPhone helped its bottom line.
After the bell, tech heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report.
And Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also on the calendar. The company’s shares climbed today after longtime short-selling nemesis made a turnaround and gave a thumbs up to Tesla.
2. New Home Sales Numbers Coming
If earnings aren’t enough, the economic calendar is heavier tomorrow, with a focus on housing data.
The recent housing numbers have been disappointing and many look on the sector as an early indication of broader economic weakness.
New home sales numbers for September arrive at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that sales of new homes last month edged up slightly to an annual rate of 630,000.
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit’s preliminary measures of manufacturing and services activity are issued. The manufacturing PMI for October is expected to edge down slightly, with the services PMI is forecast to rise from the previous month.
3. Oil Inventories Expected to Have Risen Again
Crude oil had a wild ride today, but not for the reason many expected.
Instead of prices jumping on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s speech about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, they tumbled as Saudi Arabia went on the front foot and promised as much oil as was needed.
While tensions between Saudi and the West are certainly not over, it was enough of a signal to quell some market fears about a supply shortage when Iranian sanctions kick in.
Prices could sink further if the EIA reports another outsize build in U.S. oil inventories.
Analysts expect that the U.S. crude oil stockpile rose by about 3.7 million last week."

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:07PM ET</span>",Netflix adds to growing debt pile with $2 billion bond issue,"(This version of the Oct. 22 story corrects to say new debt will be senior unsecured notes and removes reference to their priority over other debt in the penultimate paragraph)
By Kate Duguid and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced on Monday it will tap debt markets for a second time this year, aiming to raise another $2 billion as the streaming video pioneer invests heavily in production of original shows and content acquisition to fend off intensifying competition.
The move, which the company said was aimed at funding a broad spread of activities including paying for new content, spurred falls in both the prices of its bonds and its shares as investors worried about the growing costs of its huge planned investments in years to come.
Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings has been explicit about the Los Gatos, California-based company's plan to fund content acquisition by raising debt. ""We'll continue to finance our capital needs in the high-yield market,"" Hastings wrote in his second-quarter shareholder letter.
The move was very well telegraphed by Netflix, said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital, which is long in the debt, adding the debt raise ""makes sense to us.""
Netflix has said it plans to spend $8 billion on content this year. The company had already spent $6.9 billion on TV shows and movies by the end of its third quarter, suggesting that if they continue apace, their 2018 spending is likely to be closer to $9 billion. 
Netflix in April sold $1.6 billion in debt, after raising $1.9 billion in November 2017, bringing their total debt to $8.4 billion, the majority of which has been raised in the past three years. Its long-term debt as a percentage of total capital has roughly doubled to 65 percent since the end of 2014.
Bumper quarterly results last week, driven by gains in international subscribers, again eased concerns that the leader in global streaming is running out of space to expand in developed markets where it can target a mass audience at profitable prices.
But while Netflix still has huge potential in emerging markets like India, some brokerages have begun to draw attention to the overall high cost it is paying as an enterprise to gain more users.
""This is further proof of Netflix's need for capital to fund short-term operations and content capex,"" Richard Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital, which is short the equity. 
""It shows they are further than ever from being free cash flow positive,"" he said.
Prices on Netflix's existing debt dropped across the board on Monday, with the biggest drops in a bond coming due in 2026, down by about 3 cents to 91.5 cents on the dollar.
Its eurobond coming due in 2028 also dropped nearly 3 cents to 91.95 cents on the dollar.
Bearish bets against Netflix's existing $8.4 billion of junk-rated bonds have more than tripled this year to an all-time high of $347 million, Reuters reported last week.
BACKED 
Some 27 of the 43 brokerage analysts that cover Netflix continue to back the stock with ""buy"" ratings, compared to just three with ""sell"" ratings, although its shares have slipped back since last week's results.
That shows most have now given it the benefit of the doubt on a shortfall in subscriber numbers in the second quarter, and the company has also cut its projection for negative cash flow to closer to $3 billion from a previously projected minus $4 billion.
Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of Ba3 to the new notes, three notches into junk territory, which is the same rating the agency has given the company as a whole.
Standard & Poor's rated the proposed debt issue at 'BB-' and '3' recovery rating. The recovery rating indicates a meaningful recovery of about 65 percent of principal in the event of a payment default.
It said the rating reflected the company's improving underlying profit margins over the last 12 months, driven in part by price increases and subscriber growth. 
""These factors demonstrate the strength of the company's business model and its ability to expand globally, increase margins and manage its increasing debt burden,"" S&P said.
The new debt will be senior unsecured notes denominated in dollars and euros.

The company is now trading at nearly 115 times forward earnings, making it the second costliest of the FAANG group of major tech bets after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's 160 times, according to Refinitiv data.

1699,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Down, but Claws Back Bulk of 548-Point Slump","Investing.com - The Dow closed lower, but clawed back most of its big intraday losses as bargain-seeking investors swooped in on a handful of beaten-down companies offsetting weakness in industrials.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.5%, but closed well above its session low of 24,768. The S&P 500 fell 0.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.42%.
Tech stocks bounced from session lows as investors took advantage of an intraday slump and piled into blue chips, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq out of correction territory.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) closed higher.
The reversal in some tech blue chips from intraday lows comes ahead of a deluge of corporate earnings for the sector from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) due Wednesday, along with Alphabet, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) slated for Thursday.
Wall Street's attempt to close above the flatline was limited by plunging industrials as investors mulled over mixed earnings from heavyweights  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).
The S&P 500 Industrials closed more than 1% down.
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), meanwhile, served up above-forecast earnings and revenue, sending its shares soaring about 6%. While a surge in shares of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) bolstered homebuilders after posting better-expected third-quarter results, buoyed by an increase in homebuilding revenues.
Energy, meanwhile, also pressured the border market, as oil prices plunged 4% as Saudi Arabia vowed to meet the global oil demand as sanctions on Iran, slated for Nov. 4, are expected to dent global oil supplies.
In trade, meanwhile, Larry Kudlow, top White House economic advisor, told reporters that President Donald Trump will meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, next month at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, raising investor hopes that both leaders will seek to deescalate trade tensions.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied more than 12% as Wall Street turned bullish on the automaker after the company unexpectedly announced it would release third-quarter results Wednesday, which CEO Elon Musk has said would show a profit for the period.
In an effort to streamline production at its assembly factor, Tesla said Tuesday it will eliminate some interior design options for the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), meanwhile, fell more than 5% in after-hours trade after providing soft fourth-quarter guidance and missing third-quarter revenue estimates.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
 DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Diana Shipping (NYSE:DSX) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."
